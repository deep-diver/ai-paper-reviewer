However, their ability to handle complex reasoning problems remains a challenge. This paper investigates the scaling limits of LLMs in complex, non-monotonic reasoning using logic grid puzzles.  Existing benchmarks often lack precise control over problem complexity, hindering a systematic understanding of LLM capabilities.  This limits the ability to identify and address the root causes of poor performance.\nTo tackle this, the researchers introduce ZebraLogic, a novel evaluation framework that generates logic puzzles with quantifiable complexity. Using ZebraLogic, they evaluate several LLMs, finding a significant drop in accuracy as puzzle complexity increases \u2013 a phenomenon they term the \"curse of complexity.\"  This persists even with larger models, suggesting inherent limitations in current LLM architectures.  The study also explores strategies to improve performance such as Best-of-N sampling, but these offer only limited improvement.  The findings highlight the need for new approaches to enhance LLM reasoning capabilities.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.01100/podcast.wav"}
