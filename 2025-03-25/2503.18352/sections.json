It acknowledges that while diffusion models have shown promise, generating high-resolution images like 4K directly is computationally demanding. Therefore, **novel methods like Diffusion-4K are crucial for enhancing both efficiency and quality**. The study underscores the limitations of existing benchmarks, which often evaluate at lower resolutions, neglecting the fine details that characterize 4K images. Thus, the paper introduces a new benchmark, Aesthetic-4K, designed to comprehensively assess image synthesis quality at ultra-high resolutions, factoring in human perceptual cognition through metrics like GLCM Score and Compression Ratio. **The wavelet-based fine-tuning is pivotal to infuse high-frequency details while retaining low-frequency approximation for optimal image synthesis**.

It serves as a mathematical method of examining how often pairs of pixel with specific values and in a defined spatial relationship occur in an image. **GLCM extracts statistical measures** that characterize texture, contrast, homogeneity, and correlation. This approach facilitates in-depth analysis, enabling differentiation between textures that might appear similar to human perception. When examining fine details, it allows for **in-depth evaluation of the texture and structural characteristics of high-resolution images**; the GLCM score and compression ratio serve as significant complements to human perceptual cognition in 4K image synthesis."}}, {"heading_title": "Diffusion-4K", "details": {"summary": "**Diffusion-4K** is presented as a novel framework designed for direct ultra-high-resolution image synthesis, utilizing latent diffusion models. A key aspect is the **Aesthetic-4K Benchmark**, addressing the lack of publicly available 4K image synthesis datasets. This benchmark includes a curated, high-quality dataset of ultra-high-resolution images accompanied by precise captions generated by GPT-4O. To evaluate the fine details present in 4K images, new metrics such as **GLCM Score** and **Compression Ratio** were introduced, complementing holistic measures like FID and CLIPScore. A wavelet-based fine-tuning approach is proposed to optimize the generation of fine details in the images. Diffusion-4K's capabilities are validated through experiments, showcasing the effectiveness of the method in synthesizing highly detailed 4K images.
