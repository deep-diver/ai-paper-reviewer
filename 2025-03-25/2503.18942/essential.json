Scaling video generation methods in training is costly and resource-intensive. To address this, the paper investigates test-time scaling (TTS) in video generation, asking how much it can improve generation quality for challenging text prompts. This explores enhancing video generation without retraining or enlarging models. \n\nThis paper introduces Video-T1, a framework that reinterprets TTS as a search problem for better video trajectories. It uses test-time verifiers and heuristic algorithms to guide the search. A linear search strategy increases noise candidates, while Tree-of-Frames (ToF) efficiently expands and prunes video branches. Experiments show that increasing test-time compute significantly improves video quality, offering a way to achieve superior results in computer vision.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18942/podcast.wav"}
