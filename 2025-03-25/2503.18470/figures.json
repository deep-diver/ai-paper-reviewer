Given room images, user preferences, and object status, the model generates a JSON-formatted object layout with precise (x, y, z) coordinates and a reasoning process. It evaluates the layout using three reward signals: Format Detection, Physical Detection, and Rendering-based Evaluation. The RL updates are based on multiple multi-turn refinement trajectories, optimizing a grouped policy via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable the VLM to learn deeper spatial reasoning from diverse refinement outcomes.", "description": "MetaSpatial is a reinforcement learning framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs).  The figure illustrates its process: given a room image, user preferences, and object information, the VLM generates a JSON layout with precise (x,y,z) coordinates and a reasoning trace explaining its decisions. This layout is then evaluated by three reward signals: Format Detection (correct JSON structure), Physical Detection (physical plausibility, no collisions), and Rendering-based Evaluation (aesthetic quality, judged by a language model).  The RL algorithm uses multiple multi-turn refinement trajectories (iterative improvements to the layout), optimized with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to learn better spatial reasoning from various outcomes.", "section": "2 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18470/extracted/6304738/metaverse-before-after.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Before vs After: It highlights the efficacy of MetaSpatial in improving 3D spatial reasoning.", "description": "This figure presents a qualitative comparison of 3D scene layouts generated before and after applying the MetaSpatial framework.  The \"Before\" column showcases layouts generated by a vision-language model (VLM) without MetaSpatial's reinforcement learning enhancements. These layouts often exhibit issues such as misaligned, overlapping, or physically implausible object placements.  The \"After\" column displays layouts generated by the same VLM, but with MetaSpatial integrated.  These improved layouts demonstrate significantly better spatial reasoning, with objects correctly positioned, aligned, and functionally coherent, highlighting the efficacy of MetaSpatial in enhancing 3D spatial reasoning capabilities within VLMs.", "section": "3.3 Qualitative Results"}]
