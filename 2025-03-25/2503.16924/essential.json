Recent studies use fewer Gaussians with high-precision attributes, but existing compression methods still rely on many Gaussians. A smaller set of Gaussians becomes sensitive to lossy compression, leading to quality issues. Therefore, reducing the number of Gaussians is crucial as it directly affects computational costs.  \n\nThe paper introduces Optimized Minimal Gaussians representation (**OMG**), which reduces storage using minimal primitives. OMG determines distinct Gaussians from near ones, minimizing redundancy and preserving quality. It introduces a compact attribute representation, capturing continuity and irregularity. A sub-vector quantization technique enhances irregularity representation while maintaining fast training. OMG reduces storage by nearly 50% and enables 600+ FPS rendering, setting a new standard for efficient 3DGS.", "affiliation": "Sungkyunkwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16924/podcast.wav"}
