These approaches frequently require problem formalization, limiting their applicability to tasks easily represented formally. This paper addresses these limitations by exploring a new evolutionary search strategy that leverages the LLM itself to improve problem-solving ability. \nThe proposed method, Mind Evolution, uses the LLM to generate, recombine, and refine solution candidates based on feedback from an evaluator. This iterative process allows for both broad exploration and deep refinement of solutions without the need for explicit problem formalization.  The results demonstrate that Mind Evolution significantly outperforms existing inference strategies, achieving remarkable success rates on natural language planning benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.09891/podcast.wav"}
