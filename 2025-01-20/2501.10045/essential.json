"], "tldr": "Current speech super-resolution (SR) techniques often use separate networks for feature extraction and waveform generation, leading to inconsistent representations and lower quality, particularly for out-of-domain audio.  This often results in poor speech quality and generalization.  This paper introduces HiFi-SR, which uses a unified transformer-convolutional generator to address this issue.  The unified approach facilitates the seamless prediction of latent representations and their conversion into high-resolution waveforms. \nHiFi-SR incorporates a multi-band, multi-scale discriminator and mel-spectrogram loss for enhanced high-frequency fidelity. Experiments show that HiFi-SR substantially outperforms existing methods in both objective and subjective evaluations, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness across various datasets, including those outside its original training domain.  The unified approach of HiFi-SR, its superior performance, and its generalization capabilities make it a significant advancement in the field of speech super-resolution.", "affiliation": "Alibaba Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Audio Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2501.10045/podcast.wav"}
