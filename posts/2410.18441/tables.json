It details the initialization of variables, the generation of random samples for hyperparameters (c, d, sf, m) with uniform distributions within specified ranges, the calculation of performance metric (y) based on a probability distribution, the iterative update of probabilities (q) using a smoothed procedure, normalization of probabilities for top performers, selection of samples for the next round, and finally, the termination criteria based on convergence of y values.", "section": "3.1.2. Optimization of Hyperparameters for Word2vec Approach"}]
