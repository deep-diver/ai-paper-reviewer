The left chart displays the original data distribution, showing a relatively even split across several datasets including Magpie, HelpSteer2, and OffsetBias. The right chart presents the filtered data distribution after implementing the selection and filtering strategies. This filtered dataset shows a significantly different distribution, with a larger proportion allocated to Magpie_Pro_Llama3.1 and Magpie_Pro, while the contribution from the other datasets is reduced. The charts highlight the substantial shift in dataset composition as a result of data curation and selection, focusing the final dataset on more informative preference data for reward modelling.", "section": "3.1.
