[{"figure_path": "2410.18451/charts/charts_6_0.png", "caption": "Figure 2 | Adjusted score distribution of the Magpie datasets. We calculate the average ArmoRM score of the generated responses in the Magpie dataset to guide data selection. We also manually reduce the Air and Pro (Llama 3) subsets to prioritize data synthesized by stronger models. The dashed vertical lines in the plot represent the mean ArmoRM scores for each subset.", "description": "This histogram displays the distribution of ArmoRM scores for four different subsets of the Magpie dataset: Air, Pro (Llama 3), Pro (Llama 3.1), and Ultra. Each subset represents responses generated by different language models, with Ultra using the most powerful model and Air using the least powerful. The x-axis shows the ArmoRM score, ranging from 0 to 0.5, while the y-axis represents the number of pairs in each score bin. The distributions are largely unimodal, with some variation in the mean and spread for each subset.  Dashed vertical lines mark the average ArmoRM scores for each subset.", "section": "3.2.
