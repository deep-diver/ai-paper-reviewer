The rows represent the actual action types, while the columns represent the predicted action types. Each cell's color intensity corresponds to the number of instances where a specific actual action type was predicted as a specific predicted action type.  Darker colors indicate a higher count. The diagonal cells represent correctly predicted action types, showing the model's accuracy for each action type. Off-diagonal cells show misclassifications, highlighting which action types are frequently confused with each other. For example, the high value in the Click row and column indicates that the model accurately predicts click actions most of the time. The colorbar provides a scale for interpreting the numerical values represented by color intensity.", "section": "4.5 ABLATION STUDIES"}]
