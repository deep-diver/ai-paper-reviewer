To be effective, app agents must be optimized for efficiency using lightweight models that minimize memory usage and processing times.  Recent advancements have leveraged foundation models to develop app agents capable of understanding natural language and executing complex commands. However, these foundation models, due to their size and computational complexity, are resource-intensive and not practical for continuous use on mobile devices.

The problem is framed as a sequential decision-making process where the agent interacts with the phone's UI to achieve a given goal. The phone's state is represented by observations (screen captures and UI element trees), and interactions are represented as actions (type and specifications).  Sequence modeling is tackled using transformers, which are effective at handling sequential data such as text or image patches. UI elements are represented as a combination of image, text, and attribute embeddings, while actions are represented by action type and specification embeddings. The input sequence for the transformer includes goal, UI elements, and previous actions.  A novel contrastive learning approach is introduced for efficient click target prediction, which learns to contrast UI element embeddings to determine the most likely interaction target.

AcT handles the majority of actions efficiently, predicting action types like clicking, scrolling, and inputting text.  For complex tasks requiring natural language understanding (like composing messages or search queries), LiMAC leverages the VLM to generate the necessary text.  The framework processes the user's goal, the phone's current state (including screenshots and UI element trees), and past interactions to determine appropriate actions.  AcT uses a contrastive learning approach to predict click targets by comparing its outputs to embeddings of UI elements. This hybrid approach significantly reduces computational demands compared to using large foundation models alone, enabling faster and more accurate task completion on resource-constrained mobile devices.  The evaluation shows LiMAC outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to a 19% increase in action accuracy over fine-tuned VLMs and up to 42% improvement over prompt-engineering baselines.
