{"reason": "This paper introduces ARKit LabelMaker, a large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations, automatically generated using an improved automatic annotation pipeline.  It demonstrates the benefits of large-scale, real-world data for 3D semantic segmentation, surpassing the performance of models trained on synthetic data or with other pre-training methods. The dataset and pipeline are made publicly available.", "takeaways": ["ARKit LabelMaker is the largest real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations.", "Large-scale pre-training with automatically generated labels significantly improves 3D semantic segmentation performance.", "The provided pipeline and dataset facilitate easy generation of training data using readily available mobile devices."], "tldr": "ARKit LabelMaker creates a massive, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic labels using an automated pipeline, showing that large-scale real-world data significantly improves 3D scene understanding models, outperforming those trained solely on synthetic data or with other methods. The dataset and improved pipeline are publicly available."}
