[{"figure_path": "2410.13924/figures/figures_3_0.png", "caption": "Dependency graph of the LabelMakerv2 pipeline. Our LabelMakerv2 pipeline has a clear dependency structure that has to be handled in the distributed processing of the data. This has to be especially respected when recovering from job failure. There, our recovery strategy checks for unfinished jobs in the dependency graph before submitting any new jobs to avoid unnecessarily wasting compute resources. The boxes with thick yellow frame donotes visualizable tasks. These are used during inspection and job quality assurance.", "description": "The figure presents a flowchart illustrating the LabelMakerv2 pipeline's dependency graph. The pipeline starts with \"Download & Preprocessing\", followed by a \"Base Models\" block representing multiple input models (OVSeg, Grounded-SAM, InternImage, Mask3D) processing data. These models' outputs feed into a \"Consensus\" block for aggregation, followed by \"Point-Lifting\" to create 3D labels. The green box indicates an intermediate step involving \"Omni-Depth\", and the blue box signifies the final output. The figure also highlights visualizable tasks for monitoring and quality control.", "section": "3.2.

This figure shows visually appealing segmentation results, therefore illustrates the effectiveness of our pipeline. The color mapping is defined in original LabelMaker's repository.", "description": "The figure shows two pairs of 3D indoor scenes captured using an iPhone 12 Max. Each pair consists of a color image of the scene and its corresponding semantic segmentation produced by LabelMakerv2. The top row shows a living room scene, while the bottom row shows a kitchen scene. The segmentation assigns different colors to different semantic classes present in the scenes, such as floor, wall, furniture, etc. The results demonstrate the visual accuracy and plausibility of the semantic segmentation generated by LabelMakerv2.", "section": "4.5.
