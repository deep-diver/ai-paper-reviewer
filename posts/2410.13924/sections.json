Language and 2D image models have benefited immensely from the abundance of readily available data on the web, enabling self-supervised training and achieving remarkable results.  In contrast, 3D scene understanding lags significantly due to the scarcity of large-scale, adequately annotated datasets.  Ground-truth annotations are typically required for training 3D models, creating a significant bottleneck to progress. The paper introduces ARKit LabelMaker, a novel large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations, to address this data limitation. This dataset is created by extending an existing automatic annotation pipeline, LabelMaker, to handle the challenges of large-scale processing and robustly generate dense semantic labels for real-world indoor 3D scenes, aiming to achieve a \"GPT moment\" for 3D vision by providing a massive dataset for pre-training.", "first_cons": "The introduction lacks specific details about the limitations of existing datasets in 3D scene understanding.

Three training approaches were used: pre-training on the ALS200 dataset (a subset of ARKit LabelMaker with ScanNet200 labels), co-training with ALS200 combined with ScanNet200, and joint training using PTv3+PPT (a large-scale training paradigm) across several datasets including ALC and ALS200.  The evaluation metrics were mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) and per-class IoU on the ScanNet, ScanNet200, and ScanNet++ benchmarks.  The study found that pre-training on the automatically generated ALS200 dataset significantly improved performance compared to various baseline models, particularly outperforming self-supervised pre-training methods and achieving performance comparable to, or surpassing in some cases,  joint training methods.  The results highlight the benefit of large-scale, real-world datasets, even when the labels are automatically generated and may be imperfect, for 3D semantic segmentation model pre-training.\n\nThe ALS200 dataset showed noticeable improvements for MinkowskiNet on ScanNet (mIoU increasing from 73.6 to 77.0) and ScanNet200 (mIoU increasing from 29.3 to 30.6). Point Transformer V3, when pre-trained on ALS200,  exhibited an impressive increase in mIoU to 81.2 on ScanNet from its vanilla mIoU of 77.5, even exceeding results from joint training on multiple datasets.  Additionally, using the ALC dataset (ARKitScenes dataset with original 186 classes) resulted in state-of-the-art performance for PTv3+PPT on both ScanNet and ScanNet200 benchmarks, indicating substantial impact when utilizing this method for training.\n\nThe study also included an analysis on the ScanNet++ benchmark.  The pre-training approach showed a positive impact on validation set performance, but the gains didn't extend to the test set, indicating a potential overfitting issue with this benchmark.  The joint training approach using PTv3+PPT, combined with ALC, showcased the most impressive mIoU improvements on the ScanNet++ benchmark.
