[{"figure_path": "2410.13458/figures/figures_4_0.png", "caption": "Figure 1: MEDINST overview.", "description": "The figure is a treemap and a pie chart visualizing the MEDINST dataset. The treemap shows the number of samples in each of the 12 categories of tasks, each category represented by a different color. The size of each colored block reflects the number of samples in that category. Categories include NER, NED, RE, QA, COREF, EE, TE, STS, TXTCLASS, TRANSL, SUM, and TEXTPAIRCLASS.  The pie chart shows the proportion of samples in each category relative to the total number of samples. The colors used are consistent between the treemap and pie chart, allowing for easy comparison between the visual representations of the dataset composition.", "section": "3 MEDINST: Meta Dataset of Biomedical Instructions"}, {"figure_path": "2410.13458/figures/figures_4_1.png", "caption": "Figure 1: MEDINST overview.", "description": "The figure is composed of two subfigures: (a) shows a treemap visualization of the MEDINST dataset, illustrating the distribution of samples across different tasks and categories.  The color intensity of the squares represents the number of samples in each task category, ranging from NER, NED, RE, QA, COREF, EE, TE, STS, TXTCLASS, TRANSL, SUM to TEXTPAIRCLASS,  while the size of the squares corresponds to the number of samples in each category. (b) is a circular bar chart illustrating the distribution of samples across various tasks, providing a quantitative view of the dataset's composition.", "section": "3 MEDINST: Meta Dataset of Biomedical Instructions"}]
