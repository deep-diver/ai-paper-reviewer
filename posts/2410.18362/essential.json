{"reason": "WAFFLE is a novel fine-tuning strategy for multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) that improves the automation of HTML code generation from UI designs.  It addresses two key challenges: representing HTML's hierarchical structure and bridging the gap between visual UI designs and text-based HTML.  WAFFLE uses a structure-aware attention mechanism and contrastive fine-tuning to achieve state-of-the-art performance on UI-to-HTML code generation benchmarks.", "takeaways": ["WAFFLE improves the accuracy of HTML code generation from UI designs by using structure-aware attention and contrastive learning.", "WAFFLE outperforms existing methods on two benchmark datasets, WebSight-Test and Design2Code.", "WAFFLE is model-independent and can be applied to improve any MLLM for UI-to-HTML code generation."], "tldr": "WAFFLE is a new fine-tuning approach for multi-modal language models that significantly improves automated front-end web development by enhancing their understanding of HTML structure and aligning their understanding of UI images and HTML code, leading to state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks."}
