(1) Calculate ZIP-FIT Alignment of each source example with the target dataset using gzip compression. (2) Rank all source examples based on these alignment scores. (3) Select the top-K most aligned examples for fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tune a large language model using the selected top-K examples to improve performance on the target task.", "description": "This figure illustrates the ZIP-FIT data selection algorithm's workflow. It begins by obtaining both a source and target dataset (step 0).  The core of the algorithm (step 1) involves calculating a ZIP-FIT alignment score for each example in the source dataset by comparing its gzip compression to that of the target dataset.  These alignment scores are then used to rank all examples in the source dataset (step 2), allowing the selection of the top K most aligned examples (step 3). Finally, a large language model is fine-tuned using only these selected examples (step 4) to improve its performance on the target task.", "section": "ZIP-FIT: AN EMBEDDING-FREE DATA SELECTION ALGORITHM VIA COMPRESSION-BASED ALIGNMENT FOR LM FINE-TUNING"}]
