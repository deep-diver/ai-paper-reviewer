[{"figure_path": "2410.15999/tables/table_6_0.md", "caption": "Overall performance of steering the utilisation of parametric and contextual knowledge, measured by EMM and EMC. \"Without Controlling\" indicates the baseline that we do not use any controlling methods to steer the generation. #ICL is not an inference-time controlling strategy, which controls the behaviours by changing demonstrations. CAD needs additional forwarding for contrastive decoding.", "description": "The table presents the results of steering the usage of parametric and contextual knowledge in LLMs on two datasets, NQSwap and Macnoise, using different models (Llama3-8B, Llama2-7B, and Gemma2-9B).  It compares the performance of SPARE against several baselines, including representation engineering methods (TaskVec, ActAdd, SEA) and contrastive decoding methods (DoLa, CAD), as well as in-context learning (ICL). The performance is evaluated using Exact Match (EM) scores for both steering to parametric knowledge (EMM) and steering to contextual knowledge (EMC).  Results are shown for both when no control method is used (\"Without Controlling\") and when the various methods are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of steering LLMs towards either knowledge source when knowledge conflicts are present.", "section": "5 Experimental Results"}]
