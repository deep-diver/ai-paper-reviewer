It emphasizes the increasing importance of LVLMs' ability to handle multi-image contexts, a capability currently lacking in many open-source models while proprietary models like GPT-4 excel in this domain.  The section mentions that while open-source models show promise in single-image visual question answering, real-world applications often involve multiple images and texts, necessitating a shift towards models capable of understanding complex, interwoven information. The authors underscore the need for improved multi-image capabilities in LVLMs, referencing the three typical stages of LVLMs' development (pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference alignment) and noting that while recent work has focused on improving multi-image pre-training and SFT, the preference alignment stage remains under-explored for multi-image scenarios. They also point out the challenges of directly extending single-image approaches to multi-image tasks, emphasizing the scarcity of diverse training data and the high cost of annotation for chosen/rejected response pairs.

Existing methods for visual preference alignment, such as LLaVa-RLHF and RLHF-V, rely on expensive human labeling or GPT-4 API calls for data creation, making them costly and less scalable.

It begins by introducing the concept and highlighting the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) approach. The core of the method is MIA-DPO (Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization), which tackles the challenges of multi-image data scarcity and high annotation costs. MIA-DPO addresses these issues by extending single-image data with unrelated images, creating multi-image prompts in three formats (sequence, grid collage, pic-in-pic), and employing an attention-aware selection mechanism. The attention-aware selection filters out rejected responses based on attention values, thus avoiding manual annotation. The method also includes a post-selection process to further improve the quality of the data used in DPO. Finally, the DPO optimization algorithm is applied to the data, aiming to align the model's preferences with human preferences.  The method emphasizes efficiency and scalability by leveraging existing single-image data and automating the data construction and selection processes.", "first_cons": "The reliance on attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses might be susceptible to errors if the attention mechanism itself is flawed or if the model's attention is not consistently directed towards relevant regions of the images.", "first_pros": "MIA-DPO significantly reduces the costs associated with multi-image data annotations by leveraging existing single-image data and automating data construction and selection processes.", "keypoints": ["MIA-DPO leverages existing single-image data to mitigate the scarcity of diverse multi-image training data.", "Three multi-image data formats are introduced: sequence, grid collage, and pic-in-pic, each designed to address specific types of multi-image hallucinations.", "An attention-aware selection mechanism reduces manual annotation costs by using attention values to filter out rejected responses.", "Post-selection of data using three metrics (Perplexity, Length Ratio, and Edit Distance) further enhances data quality.", "The DPO algorithm is used to optimize the visual preference alignment process."], "second_cons": "The effectiveness of MIA-DPO might depend on the specific architecture and training of the LVLMs, limiting generalizability to different LVLMs.", "second_pros": "MIA-DPO is compatible with various architectures and automates the data creation process, making it easily scalable.", "summary": "The METHODS section introduces MIA-DPO, a novel visual preference alignment approach for handling multi-image inputs in Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs).
