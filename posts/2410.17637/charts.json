[{"figure_path": "2410.17637/charts/charts_7_0.png", "caption": "Figure 5: Attention Ratio Statistic. We analyze the attention ratios distribution for different image counts across various data types, and use dashed lines to indicate the thresholds for each data set.", "description": "This figure presents three sub-figures (a, b, and c) showing the distribution of attention ratios for different image counts across three data types: Sequence, Grid Collage, and Pic-in-Pic. Each sub-figure displays histograms, where the x-axis represents the attention ratio and the y-axis represents the number of samples. The attention ratio measures the proportion of attention focused on the relevant image relative to the total attention across all images.  Different colored lines in each sub-figure represent different numbers of images (e.g., 2 images, 3 images, etc.), and vertical dashed lines denote the thresholds used for selecting rejected samples.  The shaded area under each histogram visually represents the overall distribution and range of attention ratios for each scenario.", "section": "3.3.2 ATTENTION-AWARE SELECTION FOR REJECTED SAMPLES"}]
