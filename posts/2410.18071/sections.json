The authors illustrate this issue with an example from the MMT-Bench benchmark where a simple change in the prompt drastically alters the model's accuracy (from 0.233 to 0.5), thus underestimating its actual performance. They introduce TP-Eval, a novel evaluation framework designed to address this issue by customizing prompts for different models to better assess their true potentials and avoid evaluation biases.  The framework involves a prompt customizer that generates tailored prompts for each model by incorporating an optimizer-scorer architecture.  The introduction concludes by positioning TP-Eval as a valuable contribution to the field, helping build more comprehensive and reliable MLLM evaluation benchmarks.", "first_cons": "The introduction section focuses primarily on the problem of prompt sensitivity and the proposed solution (TP-Eval) without sufficient detail on the technical aspects or methodology of the proposed framework.
