For each model, it shows the percentage of times users preferred its generated images over the others in a pairwise comparison.  RankDPO outperforms both DPO-SDXL and the baseline SDXL model, achieving a win rate above 56% compared to the other models, which had win rates below 60%. The chart uses horizontal bars to represent the win rate of each model, visually highlighting the superior performance of RankDPO.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
