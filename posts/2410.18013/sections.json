Current T2I models struggle with compositional generation, text rendering, and spatial understanding.  While scaling models or improving datasets helps, these solutions are often not applicable to existing models.  Two major strategies for aligning T2I models with human feedback are:  1) collecting massive amounts of user preferences (e.g., Pick-a-Picv2 cost nearly \\$50K), and 2) reward function fine-tuning. The first is expensive and the datasets can be outdated quickly. The second suffers from reward hacking, where optimization increases reward scores without improving image quality and is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a more scalable and cost-effective approach using synthetically labeled preferences instead of relying on human annotations, addressing the limitations of current methods.", "first_cons": "Current methods for aligning T2I models with human feedback are expensive and/or produce suboptimal results.

It begins by outlining the framework of diffusion models for text-to-image generation and their optimization via direct preference optimization (DPO).  The core of the method is the creation of a scalable synthetic preference dataset called Syn-Pic. Instead of relying on expensive human annotation, Syn-Pic leverages multiple pre-trained reward models to generate ranked preferences for images produced by various text-to-image models, eliminating the need for manual labeling.  To enhance the use of this ranked data, a novel ranking-based preference optimization method called RankDPO is introduced. RankDPO integrates the discounted cumulative gain (DCG) weighting scheme to incorporate the richer signal from the ranked preferences, improving the accuracy of model alignment compared to standard pairwise preference optimization techniques. The method is illustrated with diagrams and pseudocode for training, enhancing the understanding of its implementation.", "first_cons": "The reliance on pre-trained reward models introduces a potential bias, as their estimations of human preferences may not be perfectly aligned with actual human perception.
