While large datasets from diverse sources have made large-scale robotic learning feasible, these datasets often contain mixed-quality data, making it difficult to train high-performing and fluent policies.  State-of-the-art imitation learning methods effectively replicate the distribution of demonstrations but fall short due to the mixed quality of the datasets. Generalist policies often fail due to imprecise manipulation such as grasping or dropping issues, even when they exhibit strong semantic generalization. These issues are exacerbated when the policy faces environmental shifts (e.g., changes in table texture, camera pose, and distractors).  The paper proposes an approach to improve the precision, robustness, and proficiency of generalist policies while retaining their generalization capabilities by re-ranking multiple action proposals from a generalist policy using a value function at test-time. Re-ranking actions using a value function is effective for improving the reasoning of LLMs, but it has yet to be shown effective for multi-step robotic manipulation problems with stochastic environment interaction from raw pixel observations outside simulated gym environments.  The paper introduces Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), which uses offline RL value functions to steer generalist robotic policies. V-GPS is compatible with a wide range of generalist policies without needing to fine-tune or even access the weights of the policy. The approach involves pre-training a value function on diverse robotic datasets and using it to re-rank actions from a generalist policy at deployment time. This allows for improvements in the precision and robustness of the generalist policy without needing to retrain it.", "first_cons": "Fine-tuning generalist policies is infeasible in non-stationary real-world scenarios due to the cost of data collection and the difficulty of preventing the model from losing its generalist capabilities.", "first_pros": "V-GPS preserves the generalist policy's capabilities while improving precision and robustness at deployment time, without retraining.", "keypoints": ["Large datasets used for training generalist robotic policies often have mixed quality, leading to suboptimal performance.", "Generalist policies frequently fail due to imprecise manipulation, such as dropping objects, especially in environments with distribution shifts.", "V-GPS improves policy precision and robustness by re-ranking actions according to a value function learned via offline RL, without retraining the main policy.", "V-GPS is compatible with various generalist policies and requires only black-box access to the policy's API.", "Experimental results demonstrate consistent performance improvements across 12 tasks using five different generalist policies and two robot embodiments (+82% improvement in real-world manipulation tasks)"], "second_cons": "The approach introduces additional computational overhead at deployment time because multiple action candidates are sampled and re-ranked using a value function.", "second_pros": "The modular nature of V-GPS enables a plug-and-play approach, making it compatible with various pre-trained generalist robotic policies and easy to integrate into existing systems.", "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of improving the performance of generalist robotic policies trained on noisy, diverse datasets.

The review is primarily focused on two areas: large-scale robotic datasets and policies, and value-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics. The authors highlight the challenges of training high-performing robotic policies from datasets of mixed quality, which is a common problem in the field. They discuss how prior work on large-scale datasets and policies has made significant strides in creating general-purpose robots but still falls short in terms of precision and robustness, especially under distribution shifts.

It sets the stage by introducing the concept of a Markov Decision Process (MDP), represented as *M = (S, A, P, r, \u03b3)*, where *S* is the state space, *A* is the action space, *P* is the transition probability, *r* is the reward function, and *\u03b3* is the discount factor.  The authors highlight that they are working with a language-conditioned robotic policy, denoted as *\u03c0(\u03b1|st, l)*, which means the policy's actions depend on both the current state (*st*) and a language instruction (*l*). Importantly, this policy is considered a 'black box', meaning its internal weights and parameters are not directly accessible for modification.  The goal is to improve the performance of this pre-trained, black-box policy at deployment time without retraining or altering its internal structure.  The dataset used for training the value function consists of language-annotated robot trajectories *D = {(\u03c41, l1), (\u03c42, l2), ..., (\u03c4N, lN)}*, where each trajectory *\u03c4i* contains a sequence of states and actions and *li* is the corresponding language instruction.  The authors describe how a sparse reward function is created from this dataset; trajectories are assigned a reward of +1 if the task is successfully completed and 0 otherwise. This sparse reward scheme is then used to train a value function *Q(s, a)* which estimates the long-term value of taking action *a* in state *s*. This value function will then be used to re-rank actions proposed by the black-box policy.", "first_cons": "The sparse reward function used for training the value function may not fully capture the nuances of successful task completion.

Access to the policy's internal parameters could potentially enable more effective improvements.", "second_pros": "The approach of using offline RL to train a value function that acts as a steering mechanism for the black-box policy is novel and has potential for broader applications beyond robotics.", "summary": "This section establishes a formal framework for the problem of improving a pre-trained, black-box robotic policy using offline reinforcement learning.

The imprecise grasp leads to the object falling from the gripper during task execution.\n2. **Prematurely timed attempts to complete the task:** The policy attempts to complete the task too early or holds onto the object for too long, resulting in the object falling outside of the target container.\n\nThese failure modes are illustrated with examples, including the tasks \"put pepper in pot,\" \"put mushroom on cloth,\" and \"put sushi in pot.\" Visual examples in the form of images are provided, showing the failures that occur.
