Increasing the depth of the Transformer network, while theoretically leading to better compositional generalization (Petty et al., 2024), often results in over-smoothing, where token representations become overly similar, leading to worse performance than shallower models (Zhou et al., 2021). This over-smoothing is attributed to the smoothing mechanism of attention (Shi et al., 2022) and creates an over-smoothing effect (Nguyen et al., 2023).  Existing solutions like adding regularizers (Nguyen et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2022) or optimizing information flow (Pagliardini et al., 2024) have been proposed, but training very deep Transformers remains problematic.  The introduction also notes the computational cost associated with cross-layer attention, a technique that could help alleviate the over-smoothing issue but is computationally expensive.", "first_cons": "Training very deep Transformer models is challenging, with a 32-layer Vision Transformer potentially performing worse than a 24-layer version.", "first_pros": "The Transformer model has become a leading architecture in both natural language processing and computer vision, with scaling laws driving the pursuit of larger models.", "keypoints": ["Over-smoothing in deep Transformer models, where token representations become overly similar, leads to decreased performance.", "A 32-layer Vision Transformer might underperform a 24-layer version.", "Existing solutions, such as adding regularizers or optimizing information flow, are mentioned but have limitations.", "Cross-layer attention, a computationally expensive method, is presented as a potential solution to over-smoothing"], "second_cons": "The computational cost of cross-layer attention, a potential solution to over-smoothing, is a significant hurdle.", "second_pros": "The introduction clearly lays out the challenges and existing approaches to address limitations in scaling Transformer models, setting the stage for the proposed solution.", "summary": "The Transformer architecture, while highly successful, faces challenges when scaling up the network depth. Increasing depth, while theoretically beneficial, often leads to over-smoothing, where the token representations become homogenous, resulting in performance degradation.  Existing solutions like adding regularizers or optimizing information flow provide limited relief. Cross-layer attention offers a potential solution, but its computational cost is substantial.  This introduction highlights these challenges and sets the stage for a more efficient approach."}}, {"page_end_idx": 3, "page_start_idx": 2, "section_number": 2, "section_title": "RELATED WORK", "details": {"details": "This section, \"RELATED WORK,\" reviews existing methods for improving information flow in deep learning models, particularly focusing on the challenges posed by Transformer architectures.  It begins by discussing shortcut connections, highlighting ResNet's success in addressing the vanishing gradient problem and DenseNet's approach of allowing each layer to access the states of all preceding layers.  The role of Stochastic Depth in mitigating over-smoothing is also noted.  The section then shifts to the issue of KV cache compression in Transformers, categorizing existing solutions into three groups: post-training methods, quantization techniques, and those that leverage parameter or activation value sharing.

This is achieved by approximating computationally expensive cross-layer attention.  The authors propose *ResFormer*, which uses a residual connection from the value vectors of the first layer to all subsequent layers.  This is further refined into *SVFormer*, a variant which shares the same value embedding from the first layer across all layers, effectively halving the KV cache size.  The method is motivated by the observation that information from earlier layers is valuable for later layers, but accessing it directly via cross-layer attention is too computationally intensive.  The efficiency improvement is further analyzed in the context of KV cache compression, a significant concern in large-scale transformer deployment.   Mathematical formulations and illustrations are provided to support the proposed approaches, showing that *ResFormer* and *SVFormer* offer significant advantages in efficiency and performance, outperforming vanilla transformers, denseformers and NeuTRENO across various experiments.  The authors also conducted ablation studies on various hyperparameters such as the type of residual connection (value, key or query) and different mapping matrices, proving their claims.", "first_cons": "The ResFormer and SVFormer methods still rely on the assumption that information from the first layer is sufficiently representative for all subsequent layers.

The experiments were conducted on the SlimPajama dataset, a 20B token subset of the RedPajama dataset.  The authors compared their models against the vanilla Transformer, DenseFormer, and NeuTRENO, using various model sizes and sequence lengths.  ResFormer consistently outperformed other models across different settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating attention concentration and enhancing representation. SVFormer, while showing promise in reducing the KV cache by nearly half, demonstrated a performance sensitivity to sequence length, performing better with longer sequences but training significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer.

Results showed that using only value vectors from the first layer proved to be the most effective approach.
