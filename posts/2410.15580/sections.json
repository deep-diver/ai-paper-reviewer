While LLMs excel in many language tasks, they struggle with even basic arithmetic operations like 5-digit multiplication.  Previous research, focusing on causal attribution to pinpoint specific model components responsible for arithmetic, falls short of explaining *why* LLMs struggle with certain tasks.  This paper proposes a two-pronged approach to address this gap.  Firstly, it investigates whether LLMs utilize partial products (intermediate results found in different multiplication methods) in arithmetic learning. Secondly, it explores LLMs' approach to arithmetic symbolically by analyzing how LLMs break down complex arithmetic problems into smaller subproblems or subgroups, hypothesizing that differences in subgroup complexity and selection contribute to varying levels of difficulty.  The study anticipates that this subgroup-level analysis will offer a deeper understanding of LLMs' arithmetic abilities.", "first_cons": "The introduction primarily states the problem and the proposed approach without offering any preliminary findings or insights.
