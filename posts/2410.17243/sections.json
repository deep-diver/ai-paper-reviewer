Cross-GPU tiling distributes the computation of the similarity matrix across multiple GPUs, reducing the memory burden on each individual GPU. This is achieved through an asynchronous communication strategy using a ring topology, minimizing communication overhead. Each GPU is responsible for calculating a portion of the rows of the similarity matrix and exchanging column-wise data with neighboring GPUs. In-GPU tiling further breaks down the computation within each GPU into smaller tiles, processed in parallel by multiple CUDA cores. This strategy leverages SRAM's faster access speed for computation, reducing the I/O between SRAM and HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), thereby minimizing memory consumption. By combining both cross-GPU and in-GPU tiling, Inf-CL achieves a linear growth in memory cost as opposed to the quadratic growth found in traditional contrastive learning approaches.

Algorithms 1 and 2 demonstrate this, outlining steps for forward and backward passes with both cross and intra-GPU tiling.\n\nAlgorithm 1 shows the process at a coarse-grained level, where each GPU is responsible for a portion of the rows of the similarity matrix. Communication across GPUs is handled asynchronously using a ring topology, which minimizes delays.  Each GPU performs computations on its assigned rows and exchanges column data to calculate the final LSE value. Algorithm 2 provides a more fine-grained view of the process on each GPU.
