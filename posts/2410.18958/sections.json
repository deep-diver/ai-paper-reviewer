Diffusion models are described as a forward stochastic process that iteratively transforms pure noise into clean samples, governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE).  The key is that this forward SDE has a reverse-time ODE trajectory (probability flow ODE or PF-ODE) for data sampling.  Consistency models offer a faster alternative to sampling by directly predicting the solution point of this PF-ODE, avoiding the iterative process of diffusion models. The section highlights two training strategies for consistency models: consistency distillation (CD), which leverages a pre-trained diffusion model, and consistency training/tuning (CT), which learns directly from raw data.  The loss function for both methods aims to enforce the self-consistency condition where predictions from two points on the same PF-ODE trajectory converge to the same solution.  The equations presented mathematically define the forward diffusion process and the reverse PF-ODE process, along with the loss function used in training consistency models, emphasizing the shared objective between CD and CT despite their differences in training methodology.", "first_cons": "The explanation of diffusion models and the PF-ODE is somewhat concise and might require prior knowledge of stochastic processes and differential equations for a thorough understanding.", "first_pros": "The section clearly defines the core concept of consistency models and their two main training approaches (CD and CT), providing a solid foundation for the subsequent sections.", "keypoints": ["Diffusion models use an iterative denoising process governed by a stochastic differential equation (SDE).", "The probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) allows for data sampling without additional stochasticity.", "Consistency models directly predict the solution point of the PF-ODE enabling 1-step generation.", "Two training methods are highlighted: Consistency distillation (CD) and Consistency training/tuning (CT).", "Both CD and CT share the same training loss, aiming to enforce self-consistency."], "second_cons": "The mathematical notation and equations might be daunting to readers without a strong background in probability and statistics.", "second_pros": "The section effectively contrasts consistency distillation and consistency training, highlighting the key difference in how the ground truth reward is estimated, leading to different training stability and upper performance bounds.", "summary": "This section provides a concise yet informative overview of consistency models, contrasting them with traditional diffusion models.

This framework allows for a unified understanding of different training strategies, namely consistency distillation (CD) and consistency training/tuning (CT).  The core idea is to model the denoising process as a value estimation problem using Temporal Difference (TD) learning, with the reward function linked to the accuracy of the denoising step. CD leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to estimate the reward (ground truth), resulting in lower variance but a lower performance ceiling. CT directly learns from raw data, offering a higher performance ceiling but at the cost of higher training variance. The key difference is highlighted as being in the estimation of the reward, leading to distinct training stability and upper performance bounds.
