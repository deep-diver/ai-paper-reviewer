Comparison of different hyperparameter settings in the ADEM-VL with LLaMA-7B as the language model.", "description": "This chart displays the effects of varying hyperparameters (\u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3) on the average accuracy of the ADEM-VL model using LLaMA-7B.  The leftmost panel shows a positive correlation between hyperparameter \u03b1 and accuracy, peaking around 0.1 before declining slightly. The middle panel illustrates the effect of hyperparameter \u03b2 on accuracy, showing a peak at roughly 0.01, and then a decline. The rightmost panel shows that the average accuracy improves as hyperparameter \u03b3 increases from 0 to 0.2, after which accuracy decreases slightly.", "section": "IV. EXPERIMENT"}]
