It involves iteratively generating responses from an LLM, obtaining human or synthetic feedback on those responses using a reward model, and then using reinforcement learning to update the LLM's parameters.  The standard approach is *online on-policy RL*, meaning the LLM generates responses, receives immediate feedback, and updates its parameters based on that feedback all in one synchronous step.  This approach is computationally expensive, especially for large LLMs which require substantial time and computing resources for each iteration.  The standard method for online RLHF optimization is Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), which utilizes an actor-critic framework.  Alternatives exist, such as REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO), which simplifies PPO by using multiple samples to estimate the baseline rather than a value network, or Online DPO, which focuses on direct preference optimization and has shown strong performance in RLHF settings.  Asynchronous Deep RL methods, in contrast, separate the actor's and learner's computations, allowing for faster training but introducing the challenge of off-policy learning \u2013 learning from data generated by earlier versions of the model.
