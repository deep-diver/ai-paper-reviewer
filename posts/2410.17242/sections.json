Traditional approaches heavily rely on 3D inductive biases, incorporating 3D priors and handcrafted structures to simplify the task and improve synthesis quality.  Recent advancements, such as NeRF, 3DGS, and their variants, have made significant progress by introducing new inductive biases through carefully designed 3D representations (e.g., continuous volumetric fields and Gaussian primitives) and rendering equations (e.g., ray marching and splatting with alpha blending). These methods frame view synthesis as optimizing representations using rendering losses on a per-scene basis.  Other approaches build generalizable networks to estimate representations or directly generate novel-view images, often incorporating additional 3D inductive biases like projective epipolar lines or plane-sweep volumes. While effective, these 3D inductive biases limit model flexibility and adaptability to diverse scenarios.  Large reconstruction models (LRMs) have shown progress in reducing architecture-level biases using large transformers without relying on epipolar projections or plane-sweep volumes, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, even LRMs still rely on representation-level biases (NeRFs, meshes, 3DGS) and their respective rendering equations, which limits their generalizability and scalability.

IBR techniques, including light field methods, rely on blending input images and are limited by the viewable region.  Optimizing 3D representations focuses on methods like NeRF and its variants, which use 3D inductive biases (e.g., volumetric fields, Gaussian primitives) for scene representation and rendering.  These methods have made significant progress but are often computationally expensive and lack generalizability across diverse scenes. Generalizable feed-forward methods aim to overcome the limitations of IBR and 3D representation-based methods by using neural networks trained on large datasets to directly generate novel views.  However, these approaches also usually incorporate 3D inductive biases, limiting their flexibility.
