We note that all models are trained with just 4 input views.", "description": "The chart displays the PSNR values achieved by three different models (Ours Decoder-Only, Ours Encoder-Decoder, and GS-LRM) on the GSO dataset across varying numbers of input views.  The x-axis represents the number of input views used for novel view synthesis, ranging from 2 to 16. The y-axis indicates the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), a measure of image quality.  The lines representing the three models show how their performance changes as the number of input views increases.  All three models were initially trained with only 4 input views, demonstrating the models' zero-shot generalization abilities.", "section": "4.3 EVALUATION AGAINST BASELINES"}, {"figure_path": "2410.17242/charts/charts_10_1.png", "caption": "Rendering FPS with different number of input images. We refer to rendering as the decoding process, which synthesizes novel views from latent tokens or input images.", "description": "The chart displays the rendering Frames Per Second (FPS) for both the decoder-only and encoder-decoder versions of the LVSM model, as a function of the number of input views.  The decoder-only model's FPS decreases as the number of input views increases, while the encoder-decoder model maintains a consistent, near real-time FPS across all input view counts.  A horizontal dashed line indicates the real-time threshold for reference.", "section": "4 EXPERIMENTS"}]
