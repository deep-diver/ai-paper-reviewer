It begins by defining **model editing**, explaining how it precisely adjusts a language model's behavior on specific facts without affecting unrelated samples, focusing on editing knowledge tuples represented as (subject, relation, object). The process involves replacing existing tuples with updated ones.  The section highlights three dimensions for evaluating model editing methods: **reliability**, **generalization**, and **locality** (or specificity).  Reliability assesses the accuracy of recalling the edited fact; generalization checks the model's ability to recall the fact under different phrasing; and locality ensures the edited model's outputs for unrelated inputs remain consistent after editing.  The section then introduces the concept of the **general abilities of language models**, emphasizing their importance for solving complex tasks.  It contrasts this with the typical focus of model editing research which often concentrates on reliability, generalization, and locality for downstream tasks.  The section then differentiates between **single editing** and **batch editing** in the context of *sequential editing*. In single editing, one sample is updated at a time, while in batch editing multiple samples are updated simultaneously. Finally, a formal definition of sequential editing is given, highlighting how editing operations are sequentially applied to the model, modifying it incrementally, with a model's parameter updating dependent on the previous step.
