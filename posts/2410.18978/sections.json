Flow-based methods estimate optical flow to synthesize frames, while kernel-based methods use spatially adaptive kernels.  The limitations of each are discussed: flow-based methods can struggle with inaccurate flow estimation, especially in scenes with large motions or significant appearance changes, while kernel-based methods are often limited by kernel size.  Hybrid methods combining both approaches are mentioned as attempts to leverage the strengths of each.\n\n## Generative VFI Methods\n\nA shift towards generative models for VFI is then highlighted.  The approach of using large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models is presented as a promising area. Two examples, LDMVFI and VIDIM, are mentioned, showcasing how these models attempt to address VFI as a conditional generation problem using latent diffusion models and cascaded diffusion models respectively.  However, these generative methods still face challenges handling large differences between frames and often lack user control over the interpolation process.  The lack of controllability is emphasized as a key point of difference from the interactive frame interpolation methods.\n\n## Video Diffusion Models\n\nThe discussion then expands into video diffusion models themselves. These models are noted for their ability to generate high-quality, diverse, and realistic videos, often using text or image controls. However, these controls are often deemed imprecise and not interactive enough. The section mentions attempts to introduce more sophisticated control signals, such as structural controls (sketches, depth maps), motion control (trajectories), and camera pose control, to increase the level of control over the generation process.  These advancements aim to overcome the limitations of simple text or image controls, which are often insufficient for fine-grained control in video interpolation.  This section positions Framer as a method that advances the concept of interactive control over video interpolation by employing point trajectories as a direct control signal.

Framer uses a large-scale pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model (like Stable Video Diffusion) as its base and incorporates two key innovations:\n\n1. **Interactive Frame Interpolation:**  This mode allows users to customize the transition between two frames by directly manipulating the trajectories of selected keypoints. The user interacts with the system through these keypoints, enabling fine-grained control over local motions. The system uses a trajectory controlling branch to guide the video generation process based on user-specified keypoint trajectories. This branch is trained using point trajectories from the whole video sequence, including keypoints randomly initialized and matched using Co-Tracker.\n\n2. **Autopilot Mode:** This mode automates the process of obtaining keypoint trajectories. It utilizes a novel bi-directional point-tracking method that estimates keypoint trajectories automatically by analyzing forward and backward motions between frames. This simplifies the usage for cases where manual interaction isn't desired.\n\nThe model architecture involves concatenating latent features of the start and end frames along with their noise latents for conditioning the diffusion model.  A trajectory controlling branch is then added to integrate user-provided or automatically generated point trajectories.  The training objective is to minimize the difference between the predicted noise and the actual noise during the denoising process, ensuring consistency between the given conditions (start frame, end frame, trajectories) and generated intermediate frames.\n\nThe bi-directional point-tracking method described in the autopilot mode involves: 1) initializing point trajectories by interpolating matched keypoints between the start and end frames; 2) tracking these points during denoising via nearest neighbor search in the feature space; 3) ensuring trajectory consistency by checking the bidirectional tracking consistency of points. This ensures accurate and temporally coherent trajectory updates.\n\nThe methodology is designed to address the ambiguities inherent in frame interpolation, enabling users to steer the generation process according to their specific requirements, including fine-grained control and automated trajectory generation for ease of use.", "first_cons": "The model relies on a pre-trained video diffusion model, inheriting its limitations, which may lead to suboptimal performance in certain scenarios.
