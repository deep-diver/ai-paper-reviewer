It begins by observing that while predictive models have shown promise in predicting future states, they lack a clear categorization based on inherent characteristics.  This lack of categorization hinders progress in model development and makes it challenging to compare models effectively. Existing benchmarks also fall short in evaluating highly embodied predictive models, which are capable of generating actionable videos that can be translated into control signals in dynamic environments. The authors introduce the concept of \"Predictive Models\" which are capable of generating future predictions in various forms (text, images, videos, and actionable videos). They categorize these models into a hierarchy (S0-S3), based on their level of embodiment.  The highest level (S3) consists of \"World Simulators\" that generate actionable videos, incorporating physical world rules.  The section emphasizes the need for more comprehensive evaluation methods that consider both visual fidelity and action consistency from an embodied perspective.  The authors then pose two key research questions that the paper aims to address: 1) Can we establish a reasonable hierarchical system for predictive models based on their degree of embodiment?, and 2) Can we conduct a more detailed evaluation of highly embodied predictive models from an embodied perspective?", "first_cons": "The introduction primarily focuses on the limitations of existing approaches without offering concrete solutions or a detailed roadmap of how the proposed solution will address these issues.
