Each scenario is represented by a separate radar plot, with each axis corresponding to a specific evaluation dimension (e.g., Background Consistency (BC), Foreground Consistency (FC), Instruction Alignment (IA), etc.). The radial distance of each point from the center represents the normalized score (0-1) of a model on that particular dimension within that scenario.  By comparing the radial lengths for each model across the dimensions and scenarios, one can assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of each video generation model with regards to visual quality, alignment with instructions, and embodiment.", "section": "5.2 EXPERIMENTS ON HUMAN PREFERENCE EVALUATOR"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18072/charts/charts_10_0.png", "caption": "Result of Implicit Manipulative Evaluation across three embodied scenarios.The abbreviations are listed in Sec. 4.2.2.", "description": "This chart displays the results of Implicit Manipulative Evaluation across three embodied scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environment (OE), Autonomous Driving (AD), and Robot Manipulation (RM).  For OE, it shows scores for tasks involving collecting wood, dirt, and seeds; travel distance; and dig depth. For AD, it presents scores for eight metrics: Driving Score (DS), Route Completion (RC), Infraction Score (IS), Vehicle Collisions (VC), Pedestrian Collisions (PC), Layout Collisions (LC), Red Light Violations (RV), and Offroad Infractions (OI).  Finally, for RM, scores for five metrics are presented.  The chart uses bar graphs to visually compare the performance of different video generation models across these various tasks and metrics within each scenario.", "section": "5 EXPERIMENTS"}]
