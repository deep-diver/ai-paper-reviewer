The abbreviations are listed in Tab. 2.", "description": "This radar chart visualizes the performance of eight different video generation models across three distinct embodied scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environment (OE), Autonomous Driving (AD), and Robot Manipulation (RM).  Each scenario is represented by a separate radar chart, showing the normalized scores (0-1) for various evaluation dimensions specific to that scenario.  The dimensions vary based on the scenario but include aspects like Visual Quality (Aesthetics, Background/Foreground Consistency), Condition Consistency (Instruction/Scenario Alignment), and Embodiment (Velocity, Trajectory, Interaction, Perspectivity, Safety, Key Elements).  The chart allows for a direct comparison of the relative strengths and weaknesses of each model across the different evaluation criteria and scenarios.", "section": "5.2 EXPERIMENTS ON HUMAN PREFERENCE EVALUATOR"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18072/charts/charts_10_0.png", "caption": "Result of Implicit Manipulative Evaluation across three embodied scenarios.The abbreviations are listed in Sec. 4.2.2.", "description": "This chart presents the results of the Implicit Manipulative Evaluation across three scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environment (OE), Autonomous Driving (AD), and Robot Manipulation (RM).  The chart is composed of three sub-charts, one for each scenario. Each sub-chart displays the performance of several video generation models across multiple metrics relevant to the specific scenario. For OE, the metrics are the scores for the tasks of collecting wood, dirt, and seeds, as well as travel distance and digging depth.  For AD, the metrics are Driving Score, Route Completion, and Infraction Score. For RM, the metrics are the completion scores for tasks C_1 through C_5. The height of each bar represents the score achieved by each model on each metric.", "section": "5 EXPERIMENTS"}]
