It begins by tracing the evolution of VLMs, starting from contrastive learning methods like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023), which aim to project visual and textual embeddings into a shared space.  The integration of LLMs significantly advanced the field, leading to models like Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) and BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023a) that employ cross-attention mechanisms and  MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023) and LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024c) that use simpler MLP-based projections.  The discussion expands to broader multi-modal tasks, highlighting the role of visual grounding in enhancing spatial perception.  Recent efforts focus on creating unified models capable of handling diverse vision-language tasks through sophisticated optimization techniques and complex training strategies.\n\nThe section then shifts to Video LLMs, emphasizing the challenges of processing long videos due to the context length limitations of LLMs.  Many methods address this by using techniques like extracting and encoding frames, then rearranging these into final video features (Li et al., 2023c, 2024b; Cheng et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024a). Some approaches use Q-Former modules to merge visual and text features (Li et al., 2023c, 2024b; Cheng et al., 2024), while others directly concatenate frame features (Lin et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024a).  However, the use of uniform sampling to address the length problem often results in substantial loss of visual information. Other strategies, such as pooling modules to reduce dimensions (Maaz et al., 2023b), memory modules (Song et al., 2023), or segmenting videos into shorter clips (Ataallah et al., 2024b), are also discussed. Finally, the section briefly touches upon work on video token compression, highlighting methods that use dynamic image tokens (Ma et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2022; Bolya et al., 2022) or video tokens (Lee et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023a; Choi et al., 2024) within the Transformer framework.\n\nThe \"Video Token Compression\" subsection highlights techniques employed to reduce the number of tokens to address context length limits.  Methods like Chat-UniVi (Jin et al., 2023) and SlowFast-LLaVA (Xu et al., 2024) are mentioned, which leverage various strategies including merging K-nearest neighbor tokens or uniformly sampling a select number of frames for high-resolution tokens.  The overall message is that while significant progress has been made in Video LLMs, efficiently processing very long videos remains a key challenge, motivating the development of novel compression techniques like the one proposed in the paper.", "first_cons": "The review of existing Video LLMs focuses mainly on the methods used to deal with long video lengths and doesn't critically analyze their strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance or generalizability beyond simple benchmarks.", "first_pros": "The section provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of VLMs and Video LLMs, highlighting key milestones and challenges in the field.

For Video LLMs, it discusses common approaches to handling long videos such as uniform sampling, pooling, memory modules, and video segmentation.  It also touches upon the emerging area of video token compression, where various methods are used to reduce the number of tokens to fit within context limits.  The review establishes a clear foundation for presenting the proposed novel approach to efficiently handle long video content."}}, {"page_end_idx": 5, "page_start_idx": 4, "section_number": 3, "section_title": "Method", "details": {"details": "The LongVU method for processing long videos uses a three-step spatiotemporal adaptive compression strategy.  First, a temporal reduction strategy leverages DINOv2 features to identify and remove redundant frames, reducing the video length by approximately half. Second, a selective feature reduction via cross-modal query uses text queries to determine which frames to keep at full resolution and which frames to reduce spatially (to lower resolution). This step balances preserving important visual details related to the query with the constraint of limited context length. Finally, a spatial token reduction, based on temporal dependencies, further reduces the number of tokens in frames that remain. This approach adjusts to excessively long videos by using non-overlapping sliding windows (size K=8) to apply spatial token reduction, with the first frame always retaining its full resolution and tokens in subsequent frames pruned based on similarity to the first frame. The result is a reduced number of tokens that are still representative of the video content.", "first_cons": "The method relies heavily on the effectiveness of DINOv2 in identifying redundant frames. If DINOv2 fails to accurately identify these frames, the effectiveness of the compression technique could be reduced. The choice of thresholds and parameters (like window size K) may require careful tuning for optimal results, potentially requiring more computational resources.", "first_pros": "The three-step approach effectively balances temporal and spatial compression by adaptively reducing the number of tokens while retaining important information. LongVU demonstrably improves video understanding performance on long videos, indicating the effectiveness of the compression strategy.", "keypoints": ["Three-step spatiotemporal compression: temporal reduction (using DINOv2), selective feature reduction (cross-modal query), and spatial token reduction.", "Temporal reduction reduces video length by approximately half (~45.9% of frames retained on average).", "Selective feature reduction prioritizes preserving key frames (up to 144 tokens) relevant to the text query.", "Spatial token reduction uses sliding windows of size K=8, reducing tokens based on temporal dependencies.", "The method processes videos sampled at 1 fps."], "second_cons": "The effectiveness of the cross-modal query in selecting key frames could be affected by the quality of the text query or the complexity of the video content.

The method works with only 1fps video input, minimizing computational cost for long videos.", "summary": "LongVU employs a three-step spatiotemporal adaptive compression technique to efficiently process long videos.
