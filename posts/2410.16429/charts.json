It consists of two sub-charts: (a) Number of goals generated for the hammer tactic and (b) Total runtime.  Each sub-chart displays the distribution of the number of hammer tactic invocations and the total runtime, respectively, for both validation and test datasets, broken down further by the number of sketches (1 or 3) used in the DSP process.  The x-axis represents the number of hammer goals or runtime (in seconds), while the y-axis represents the count.  The charts allow for comparison of the performance of the DSP system across different conditions (validation/test sets and 1/3 sketches).", "section": "5 Evaluation"}, {"figure_path": "2410.16429/charts/charts_15_0.png", "caption": "Fig. 7: Hammer invocations and runtimes of DSP on the validation and test sets of MiniF2F using the ol-preview model.

The left-hand histogram shows the distribution of the number of goals requiring the hammer tactic, comparing results from validation and test sets.  The right-hand histogram presents the distribution of the total runtime for each benchmark, also differentiated by validation and test sets. The charts illustrate the runtime and number of goals generated for each experiment, with the legend indicating whether the data is from the validation or test set and the number of sketches used.", "section": "5 Evaluation"}]
