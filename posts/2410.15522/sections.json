It explains that RMs are crucial for aligning LLMs with human preferences by incorporating human feedback into the language modeling process. The core concept revolves around preference learning, where human-provided ranked responses (a chosen and a rejected response to a given prompt) train the RM. This training aims to maximize a reward function, which can be achieved through various methods. The section describes three primary types of reward model implementations: Classifier RMs, which use human feedback to directly train a separate model to classify preferred responses; Implicit RMs, which skip the separate reward model and directly optimize the LLM policy on the preference data; and Generative RMs, which use LLM generations as a feedback mechanism for aligning the model. Finally, the section highlights the popular RewardBench benchmark for evaluating RMs, which assesses them based on the accuracy of preferring the human-selected response over the rejected response.  The overall goal is to leverage human feedback to improve the alignment and desired behavior of LLMs.", "first_cons": "The description of the three RM types is somewhat brief and lacks detailed technical explanations of the underlying algorithms or implementation specifics for each type.
