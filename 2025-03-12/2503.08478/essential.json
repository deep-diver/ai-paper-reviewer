This paper addresses these issues by introducing a novel, training-free approach to face anonymization. Traditional methods like blurring reduce image quality. Recent GAN-based methods and diffusion models have limitations in preserving attributes,adapting to diverse data, and may overwrite important facial features.\n\nThe paper presents a method leveraging latent diffusion inversion with an identity-conditioned model, named **NullFace**. It uses pre-trained diffusion models without extra training, inverting input images to recover initial noise, then denoises via an identity-conditioned diffusion process. Key benefits include preserving non-identity attributes,localized anonymization controlled by segmentation masks, and competitive anonymization, attribute preservation, and image quality compared to current state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "University of Trento", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Face Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "2503.08478/podcast.wav"}
