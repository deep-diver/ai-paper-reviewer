First, DDPM inversion is used on an input facial image to obtain the initial noise map (xT) and a sequence of noise maps (zt).  Then, face embeddings are extracted and negated using a hyperparameter (\u03bbid) to create 'negative identity guides.' These guides prevent the model from reconstructing the original identity. The denoising process involves two paths: a conditional path using the negated embeddings to obscure identifying features and an unconditional path using null embeddings (\u2205) to preserve non-identifying attributes. The outputs of these paths are merged using a guidance scale parameter (\u03bbcfg), defined in Equation 3.
