This is motivated by applications like coaching and skill learning, where understanding these nuances is crucial. However, there is a lack of suitable datasets for developing and evaluating models for this task. Current video understanding research emphasizes coarse-grained action comparisons, missing the fine-grained details needed in many real-world scenarios. To tackle this the authors introduce a 'closed' setting for video analysis to focus on video analysis. \n\nTo facilitate research in this area, the authors create VidDiffBench, a benchmark dataset containing 549 video pairs with annotations of action differences. The benchmark uses the VidDiff Method: action difference proposal, keyframe localization, and frame differencing. Experiments demonstrate that VidDiffBench poses a significant challenge for state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs). The paper also analyzes the failure cases of LMMs, highlighting challenges in localizing relevant sub-actions and achieving fine-grained frame comparison.", "affiliation": "Stanford", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.07860/podcast.wav"}
