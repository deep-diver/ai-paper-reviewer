Current evaluation methods are too coarse for assessing fine-grained understanding, while existing segmentation methods disrupt the MLLM's text output space by relying on implicit tokens or external pixel decoders. This paper aims to address these limitations.\n\nTo solve this, the paper introduces the **Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT)**, where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools, modeling the segmentation task as a multi-step Markov Decision Process. It introduces **SegAgent**, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, achieving SOTA performance and supporting tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. Techniques like StaR and PRM guided tree search further enhance the model.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.08625/podcast.wav"}
