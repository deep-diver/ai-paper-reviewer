"], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) like Transformers struggle with long-context reasoning and complex multi-step inference. Existing solutions often sacrifice generalization or introduce significant computational overhead. This paper presents LM2, a novel Transformer architecture integrating an auxiliary memory module.\n\nLM2 enhances the standard Transformer architecture by adding a complementary memory pathway. This memory module interacts with input tokens via cross-attention and updates dynamically via gating mechanisms. LM2 outperforms existing models on the BABILong benchmark (designed for memory-intensive tasks), showing significant improvements in multi-hop reasoning, numerical reasoning, and long-context question answering.  Importantly, LM2 also achieves performance gains on the MMLU dataset, demonstrating that its memory enhancements do not come at the cost of general performance.
