Existing methods often face challenges with efficiency and generalizability, especially when dealing with complex problems requiring multiple reasoning steps.  This necessitates more efficient and generalizable inference scaling approaches for enhanced reasoning performance.\nReasonFlux addresses this challenge by introducing a hierarchical LLM reasoning framework that leverages a structured library of thought templates, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize template trajectories, and a novel inference scaling system. This allows ReasonFlux to effectively scale its reasoning capabilities to complex problems. Results demonstrate ReasonFlux's significant outperformance over state-of-the-art LLMs in mathematical reasoning benchmarks, showcasing its efficiency and effectiveness.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06772/podcast.wav"}
