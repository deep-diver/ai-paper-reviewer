Existing methods often struggle with these aspects, either limiting the scale of the generated scenes or failing to ensure smooth and believable animations of moving objects.  Current methods also often lack the data needed to properly train models. The development of large-scale, high-fidelity data sets, and models that separate dynamic objects from static components is vital.\n\nCityDreamer4D tackles these challenges with a novel compositional approach. It separates dynamic elements (traffic) from static elements (buildings, roads), and uses specialized neural fields for each object type. This approach makes the generation process more manageable, efficient, and scalable. The model also leverages three datasets (OSM, Google Earth, CityTopia) for training and validation, providing a comprehensive resource for future research. The results show CityDreamer4D outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and temporal coherence.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08983/podcast.wav"}
