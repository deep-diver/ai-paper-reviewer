{"importance": "This paper is important because **it addresses the significant challenge of controllable and high-quality AI music generation**, a currently under-explored area.  Its **novel framework, XMusic, and large-scale dataset, XMIDI**, provide valuable resources for researchers and open new avenues for research in multi-modal music generation and AI-driven music creation.", "summary": "XMusic, a novel framework, enables controllable and high-quality symbolic music generation from diverse prompts (images, text, humming) using a multi-modal parser and a multi-task learning selector.", "takeaways": ["XMusic offers a generalized and controllable framework for symbolic music generation using diverse input modalities.", "XMIDI, a large-scale symbolic music dataset with fine-grained emotion and genre labels, is introduced.", "XMusic significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective evaluations."], "tldr": "Current AI music generation struggles with high-quality output and control over musical elements, particularly emotions.  This paper tackles these issues by introducing XMusic, a framework for symbolic music generation.  Existing methods often lack the ability to integrate diverse input sources (images, text, humming) and to assess the generated music's quality effectively. \nThe XMusic framework addresses this by employing a multi-modal prompt parser (XProjector) that translates diverse inputs into symbolic music elements. A music generator (XComposer) creates music based on these elements, while a quality selector identifies high-quality outputs using multi-task learning (quality, emotion, and genre recognition). XMusic also leverages XMIDI, a newly created large-scale symbolic music dataset with precise annotations, for training. The results demonstrate significant improvements in music quality and control compared to previous methods.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Music Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08809/podcast.wav"}
