The dataset includes 313 lengthy documents spanning 10 diverse domains, accompanied by 1,685 questions.  Crucially, each question is annotated at two levels: page-level (indicated by screenshots showing the relevant pages), and layout-level (highlighted by red boxes around specific layouts such as paragraphs, tables, figures, or charts within those pages). This dual annotation allows for more fine-grained evaluation of multi-modal retrieval systems, going beyond simply finding the right page to identifying the precise layout containing the answer.", "section": "3 MMDocIR: Evaluation Set"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.08828/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2.

The chart presents two sets of data: one showing the overall distribution across all document types in the benchmark, and another detailing the distribution broken down by seven different document domains (Overall, Research Report, Administration & Industry, Tutorial & Workshop, Academic Paper, Brochure, Financial Report, Guidebook).  The key takeaway is that text constitutes the majority of content, but images and tables also make up a significant portion.  White spaces, headers, and footers have been excluded from the area calculations to focus solely on the content itself.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.08828/x3.png", "caption": "(a) Avg word length", "description": "Figure 3 is a combined bar chart and histogram visualizing the average word length and the distribution of word lengths for OCR text and VLM text extracted from tables and figures within the MMDocIR dataset. The bar chart compares the average word lengths of OCR-derived text and VLM-generated text for tables and figures separately, while the histogram displays the distribution of word lengths for both OCR and VLM text across all instances.
