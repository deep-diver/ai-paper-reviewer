However, current methods use the same large model across all scales, resulting in high computational costs and limiting performance, especially with high-resolution inputs.  This is exacerbated in multimodal large language models where processing high-resolution images significantly impacts inference speed.  Existing methods like feature pyramids try to mitigate this, but top-performing models still rely on computationally expensive image pyramids.\n\nThe researchers address these issues by introducing PIIP (Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks).  PIIP uses pretrained models of different sizes for different image resolutions\u2014smaller models for higher resolutions to reduce the computational burden.  It incorporates a novel cross-branch feature interaction mechanism to integrate information across scales effectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIIP significantly outperforms existing methods on various tasks, including object detection, segmentation, classification, and multimodal understanding, achieving state-of-the-art results with drastically lower computational costs.
