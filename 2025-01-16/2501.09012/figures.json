The process begins by sampling content and style pairings from the MM-StyleBench dataset and generating stylized images using various stylization models.  Next, 2-alternative forced choice (2AFC) comparisons are created, and human preferences are collected and processed using Elo ranking to generate a global ranking of stylized images.  Finally, to mitigate MLLM hallucinations, the proposed ArtCoT prompting method, involving three art-specific phases (content analysis, art criticism, and summarization), is applied to obtain MLLM rankings, which are then correlated with the human rankings to measure aesthetic alignment.", "section": "IV.

The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) is used to measure the alignment between MLLM rankings and human preferences for per-instance ranking. The results are broken down by various attributes from the MM-StyleBench dataset to show how MLLM performance changes based on factors such as content complexity, style attributes, and the length and detail of text prompts.  The figure demonstrates that the ArtCoT prompting method significantly improves alignment across all attribute categories, especially for instances with longer and more detailed prompts, indicating enhanced aesthetic reasoning capabilities.", "section": "VI.

It starts by generating a minimum spanning tree to guarantee connectivity.
