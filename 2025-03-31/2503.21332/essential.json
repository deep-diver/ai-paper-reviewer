It is also aligned with the growing trend of leveraging LLMs for multifaceted task optimization.", "summary": "ReFeed enhances multi-dimensional summarization by using reflective reasoning on feedback, mitigating trade-offs between dimensions and improving robustness.", "takeaways": ["Reflective reasoning is crucial for effectively balancing trade-offs in multi-dimensional summarization refinement.", "Simultaneous processing of feedback dimensions mitigates order bias and improves refinement quality.", "Validating feedback through reflective reasoning enhances robustness against noisy or inaccurate feedback."], "tldr": "Current summarization refinement often focuses on a single dimension like faithfulness, potentially compromising other quality aspects. Existing methods struggle to handle trade-offs, ordering biases, and noisy feedback when extending to multiple dimensions. Addressing these challenges is crucial for producing high-quality summaries that meet diverse criteria.\n\nTo solve the issues, this paper introduces ReFeed, a novel refinement pipeline that uses **reflective reasoning on feedback to enhance multiple dimensions simultaneously**. The authors release SumFeed-CoT, a large-scale dataset, and demonstrate ReFeed's effectiveness in balancing trade-offs, mitigating biases, and maintaining robustness against noisy feedback. **It offers a promising direction for developing more robust and reliable text summarization systems**.", "affiliation": "Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST)", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Summarization"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21332/podcast.wav"}
