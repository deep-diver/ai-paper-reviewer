{"importance": "This paper introduces TextCrafter and the CVTG-2K dataset, offering a new approach to **generating accurate and contextually relevant visual text** in complex images. It addresses limitations in current models and opens new avenues for research in multi-instance visual generation and text rendering, pushing the boundaries of AI's ability to integrate text seamlessly into visual content.", "summary": "TextCrafter: Precisely renders multiple texts in complex scenes, overcoming distortion and omission issues in existing visual text generation models.", "takeaways": ["TextCrafter, a training-free framework, enhances multi-text control by instance fusion, region insulation, and token focus.", "The CVTG-2K dataset is introduced for evaluating models in complex visual text generation tasks, encompassing diverse positions, quantities, lengths, and attributes.", "Experiments demonstrate TextCrafter's superior performance in robustness, accuracy, and prompt-following ability compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches."], "tldr": "Current image generation models struggle with rendering visual text, especially in complex scenarios, leading to text distortion, omission, and blurriness. This paper tackles these challenges in Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG) by introducing **TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method**. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components, ensuring alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. It incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text.\n\nThe authors present the **CVTG-2K dataset** to evaluate generative models on CVTG tasks. TextCrafter consists of three key stages: **instance fusion** to strengthen the connection between visual text and its carrier; **region insulation** to initialize layout information and separate text prompts across regions; and **text focus** to enhance visual text attention maps. Extensive experiments show that TextCrafter outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.23461/podcast.wav"}
