[{"heading_title": "TextCrafter: CVTG", "details": {"summary": "**TextCrafter** tackles the Complex Visual Text Generation (CVTG) task by generating intricate textual content across diverse visual regions within images. Image generation models in CVTG often distort, blur, or omit visual text, which TextCrafter addresses with a novel multi-visual text rendering method. Employing a progressive strategy, TextCrafter deconstructs complex visual text into components while aligning content and its visual carrier, using a token focus enhancement to emphasize text during generation. It tackles text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. TextCrafter outperforms current methods and is rigorously evaluated on the CVTG-2K dataset."}}, {"heading_title": "Instance Fusion", "details": {"summary": "**Instance Fusion** aims to accurately position visual text within an image by integrating text content with its spatial carrier. It leverages the embedding of the preceding quotation mark, which encapsulates complete information about the text, to establish spatial relationships. By incorporating this embedding into the carrier's embedding via weighted fusion, it ensures precise alignment and prevents text from floating in incorrect positions. This strategy enhances the model's ability to generate images where visual text is logically and spatially consistent with the surrounding elements, improving the overall coherence and realism of the generated scene. The fusion process is controlled by a parameter \u03bb, which determines the proportion of the quotation mark's embedding added to the carrier's embedding, allowing for fine-tuning of the spatial integration."}}, {"heading_title": "Region Control", "details": {"summary": "While the title 'Region Control' isn't explicitly present, the paper introduces a region insulation strategy that implicitly manages different regions of interest where texts appear. **Region insulation is key to disentangling complexity in CVTG by separating text instances and preventing glyph or layout interference**. The study leveraged the DiT model's positional priors to initialize layouts and assigned bounding boxes to each visual text, essentially isolating them for individual processing. This approach, in contrast to relying on LLMs or manual layout, harnesses the model's inherent spatial understanding. The region control ensures **text boundaries were well-defined to harmonize the overall image, preventing confusion**. Ablation studies revealed its effectiveness in reducing text interference. This form of localized control is vital for precise manipulation and coherency, as the quality of the generated visual texts is greatly improved with the technique."}}, {"heading_title": "CVTG-2K dataset", "details": {"summary": "The paper introduces CVTG-2K, a novel dataset addressing the limitations of existing visual text benchmarks. **CVTG-2K tackles complex visual text generation**, featuring diverse scenes, multiple text regions (2-5), varied text lengths (avg. 8.10 words, 39.47 characters), and attributes (size, color, font). **Unlike fixed-template datasets**, CVTG-2K ensures diversity and real-world relevance through prompts generated by OpenAI's O1-mini API using Chain-of-Thought techniques. The dataset includes fine-grained information, decoupling prompts and specifying carrier-text relationships. **Rigorous filtering and manual review ensures quality and avoids harmful content**. Public release alongside the code will foster research in complex visual text generation."}}, {"heading_title": "Focus on small Text", "details": {"summary": "Focusing on small text within complex visual scenes presents a significant challenge in text generation. Accurately rendering small text requires high fidelity to avoid blurriness and maintain legibility, which is crucial for conveying information effectively. The model needs to allocate sufficient attention to these regions, ensuring that the details are preserved during the generation process. Techniques such as **attention control mechanisms** and **token focus enhancement** can be employed to amplify the prominence of small text. This involves refining the attention maps to highlight textual elements and re-weighting the relevant features. Addressing the small-text challenge is important for enhancing the overall quality and informativeness of generated images, particularly in scenarios where textual information is a key component."}}]
