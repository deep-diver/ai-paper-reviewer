{"importance": "This research advances RLVR by **expanding its applicability to diverse domains** beyond math/coding. The work introduces a cross-domain reward model, which **improves the efficiency, scalability, and robustness** of the RLVR framework. This enables the use of RLVR for complex reasoning tasks with noisy labels.", "summary": "RL with Verifiable Rewards is now expanding to diverse domains like medicine!", "takeaways": ["RLVR is effective beyond math and coding, even with unstructured answers.", "Cross-domain reward models can be trained without task-specific annotations.", "Model-based soft rewards improve RLVR's performance, scalability and robustness."], "tldr": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has shown great promise but mainly in structured domains like math and coding. The necessity of large-scale annotation for training domain-specific reward models is challenged by the limitation of binary rewards for unstructured answers. \n\nThis paper broadens RLVR's use to areas like medicine by using model-based soft scoring and a cross-domain reward model. Using a distilled generative reward model as a verifier, the researchers achieved excellent results without needing domain-specific annotations. This approach surpasses current open-source LLMs in free-form answer tasks.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.23829/podcast.wav"}
