{"importance": "This work offers a new perspective on leveraging LLMs for automated planning, potentially shifting the focus from direct planning to heuristic generation. By demonstrating the effectiveness of LLM-generated heuristics, it opens new avenues for integrating LLMs into existing planning systems and improving their efficiency and scalability. It also highlights the importance of task-dependent heuristics.", "summary": "LLMs generate Python heuristics for classical planning, outperforming traditional methods and challenging the state-of-the-art planning techniques.", "takeaways": ["LLMs can generate effective domain-dependent heuristics for classical planning.", "LLM-generated heuristics can outperform state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics.", "A sampling-based approach can improve the planning capabilities of LLMs."], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in various AI tasks, but they often struggle with reliable planning. Even with advanced prompting or fine-tuning, LLMs tend to produce incorrect plans and fail to generalize to larger tasks. Existing approaches often rely on manually crafted or learned heuristics for specific domains, incurring significant human effort or computational cost whenever new domains are introduced.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach: using LLMs to automatically generate domain-dependent heuristic functions in Python. This **method involves prompting the LLM to generate multiple candidate heuristics, evaluating them on a training set, and selecting the strongest one**. This process yielded heuristics that outperformed state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics and were competitive with learning algorithms. The results showed **LLM-generated heuristics sometimes expand fewer states** than existing heuristics.
