{"importance": "SemViQA sets a new benchmark in Vietnamese fact verification, offering a strong baseline for future research. Its component SER and TVC, offer insights for improving fact-checking systems, especially for low-resource languages. **This work can inspire development of more accurate and efficient misinformation detection tools.**", "summary": "SemViQA: A new approach to boost Vietnamese fact-checking with semantic understanding and efficient evidence retrieval.", "takeaways": ["SemViQA achieves state-of-the-art results in Vietnamese fact verification, outperforming existing baselines on ISE-DSC01 and ViWikiFC datasets.", "The framework combines Semantic-based Evidence Retrieval (SER) and Two-step Verdict Classification (TVC) to balance precision and speed.", "SemViQA Faster improves inference speed significantly while maintaining competitive accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications."], "tldr": "The paper addresses the growing issue of misinformation, particularly in low-resource languages like Vietnamese, where existing fact-checking methods struggle with semantic nuances and complex linguistic structures. Current systems often trade accuracy for efficiency. To solve the problems, **the authors introduces SemViQA**, a novel Vietnamese fact-checking framework designed to improve both accuracy and speed. **SemViQA addresses semantic ambiguity, homonyms, and complex linguistic structures**, achieving state-of-the-art results on standard datasets. \n\nSemViQA integrates Semantic-based Evidence Retrieval (SER) and Two-step Verdict Classification (TVC). SER combines TF-IDF for speed with a Question Answering Token Classifier (QATC) for semantic understanding. TVC uses a hierarchical approach with Focal Loss and Cross-Entropy Loss for robust classification. **Two versions are presented: SemViQA Standard prioritizes accuracy, while SemViQA Faster emphasizes speed**. Experiments on ISE-DSC01 and ViWikiFC datasets show SemViQA outperforms existing methods, with SemViQA Faster achieving a 7x speedup.", "affiliation": "FPT Software AI Center, Viet Nam", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2503.00955/podcast.wav"}
