Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove such data without retraining the model. While MU in text and vision is relatively well-studied, multimodal unlearning (MMU), removing data from models that process both text and images, remains significantly underexplored.  This is partly due to a lack of suitable open-source benchmarks.\nThis paper introduces CLEAR, a new benchmark specifically designed for evaluating MMU methods. CLEAR comprises 200 fictitious individuals linked to 3700 images and question-answer pairs. The researchers evaluated 10 existing unlearning methods, adapting them for MMU.  They found that a simple l1 regularization on LoRA weights significantly reduces catastrophic forgetting. The dataset and benchmark are publicly available, enabling a more thorough exploration of MMU techniques."}
