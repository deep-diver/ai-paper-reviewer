{"importance": "This paper is crucial because it systematically investigates the effects of scaling both training-time and inference-time compute on speech synthesis, a significant trend in current research.  It bridges the gap between text-based LLMs and TTS, suggesting novel strategies for performance improvement. The provided open-access model and code further enhance its impact, enabling researchers to build on and extend this work, potentially leading to breakthroughs in natural and expressive speech generation.", "summary": "Llasa, a novel single-Transformer TTS model, achieves state-of-the-art performance by scaling both training and inference compute, improving naturalness, prosody and emotional expressiveness.", "takeaways": ["Llasa, a novel single-Transformer TTS model, leverages a well-designed speech tokenizer for efficient and scalable speech synthesis.", "Scaling training compute for Llasa consistently improves the naturalness and prosody of synthesized speech.", "Scaling inference compute by incorporating speech understanding models enhances emotional expressiveness, timbre, and content accuracy."], "tldr": "Current state-of-the-art speech synthesis often involves multi-stage models, complicating the decision of whether to scale during training or testing.  The research also highlights the lack of a standard framework in TTS, in contrast to the common design philosophy of text LLMs that has spurred rapid progress.  This limits exploring broader research questions beyond architecture exploration.\nTo address these issues, the paper proposes Llasa, a simple single-Transformer TTS framework aligned with standard LLMs. The approach uses a single-layer vector quantizer (VQ) codec and a single Transformer architecture. Experiments show that scaling training-time compute consistently improves the naturalness and prosody of synthesized speech.  Furthermore, scaling inference compute by integrating speech understanding models as verifiers improves emotional expressiveness, timbre, and content accuracy.  The release of the model and code further promotes community research and development.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.04128/podcast.wav"}
