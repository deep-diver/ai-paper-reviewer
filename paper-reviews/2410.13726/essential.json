Unlike most existing methods that rely on slower, autoregressive strategies, DAWN utilizes a non-autoregressive diffusion model, significantly accelerating the video generation process.  To address the challenges of generating long, consistent videos with NAR models, DAWN cleverly separates the generation of facial dynamics (primarily lip movements) from head pose and blinks.  This disentanglement simplifies training and improves the model's ability to create natural-looking videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate DAWN's superiority in terms of speed and video quality, particularly for longer sequences.  DAWN also introduces a two-stage curriculum learning approach which further refines the model's accuracy and ability to generalize to unseen data."}
