Unlike previous methods that relied on autoregressive strategies (generating one frame at a time), DAWN uses a non-autoregressive approach, creating the entire video sequence at once. This results in faster video generation.  To achieve natural-looking videos, DAWN separates the generation of lip movements from head pose and blinks. The lip movements are generated using an audio-driven diffusion model, while the head pose and blinks are handled by a separate lightweight network trained on longer sequences. A curriculum learning approach further enhances the model's ability to generate long, consistent videos.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAWN produces high-quality videos with precise lip synchronization, natural head pose and blinks, and high generation speed, showing promising results in talking-head video generation."}
