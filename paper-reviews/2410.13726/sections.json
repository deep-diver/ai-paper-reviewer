Deterministic models, while early attempts, suffered from limitations in realism and expressiveness. GAN-based methods improved visual realism but struggled with mode collapse and convergence issues. Diffusion models, a more recent development, demonstrated strong potential with high-quality results, but most relied on autoregressive (AR) or semi-autoregressive (SAR) strategies.  These AR/SAR approaches, while effective, were noted for their slower generation speeds and limited context utilization due to the sequential nature of the generation process, leading to error accumulation and performance constraints, particularly in longer video sequences. The section highlights the challenges of generating long videos (extending over several seconds) due to the inherent long-term dependencies of head pose and blink movements in relation to speech audio.  The limited capacity of AR/SAR methods to capture this relationship effectively was discussed as a significant limitation.", "first_cons": "Existing methods, especially those based on GANs, often suffer from issues like mode collapse and convergence difficulties, which hinder the generation of diverse and high-quality results.", "first_pros": "The review effectively categorizes existing approaches to talking head generation into deterministic, GAN-based, and diffusion models, providing a comprehensive overview of the evolution of the field.", "keypoints": ["Early deterministic models lacked realism and expressiveness.", "GAN-based models showed improved realism but faced mode collapse and convergence problems.", "Diffusion models achieved high-quality results but mostly relied on slow autoregressive (AR) or semi-autoregressive (SAR) strategies.", "AR/SAR methods suffered from slower generation speeds and limited context utilization, leading to error accumulation and performance constraints, especially with longer videos.", "Talking head generation is challenged by the strong coupling between lip movements (short-term) and head pose/blink movements (long-term), which extends over several seconds, thus demanding extensive sequences for adequate training."], "second_cons": "The discussion of limitations in AR/SAR approaches is detailed but could benefit from a more quantitative comparison of the generation speeds and error rates across different methods.", "second_pros": "The section clearly identifies the key challenges in talking head video generation, particularly regarding long-term dependencies, providing valuable context for the proposed DAWN framework.", "summary": "This section provides a comprehensive overview of existing audio-driven talking head generation methods, highlighting the limitations of earlier techniques such as deterministic and GAN-based approaches.

DAWN is divided into three main components: the Latent Flow Generator (LFG), the Audio-to-Video Flow Diffusion Model (A2V-FDM), and the Pose and Blink generation Network (PBNet).  LFG learns a self-supervised representation of motion in the latent space using an encoder-predictor-decoder structure to predict the next frame from the current frame and the source image. A2V-FDM, a diffusion model, utilizes this motion representation along with audio and pose/blink information to generate a full video sequence in a non-autoregressive manner.  The audio embedding controls lip motion, while explicit pose and blink signals guide the generation of those movements, aided by the PBNet. PBNet, a lightweight transformer-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE), is trained on long sequences and is able to generate natural-looking head pose and blink movements.  A two-stage curriculum learning (TCL) strategy is employed to improve training efficiency and extrapolation ability, starting with shorter sequences and gradually transitioning to longer ones. The A2V-FDM model is based on a 3D U-Net architecture with temporal and spatial attention, using Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE) to handle long sequences better.  The loss function combines standard diffusion model loss with a weighted lip-synchronization loss to ensure precise lip movements. Finally, the inference process involves feeding audio and a source image to the PBNet and A2V-FDM to generate the video sequence.", "first_cons": "The model's reliance on separate components for lip motion, head pose, and blinks may lead to inconsistencies between these movements in the final output, although decoupling facilitates training.", "first_pros": "The non-autoregressive nature of DAWN leads to significantly faster video generation compared to autoregressive models, allowing for generation of arbitrarily long videos.", "keypoints": ["DAWN is composed of three main parts: LFG, A2V-FDM, and PBNet.", "A2V-FDM generates motion representations from audio and pose/blink signals using a 3D U-Net architecture with temporal and spatial attention and RoPE.", "PBNet, a VAE, generates pose and blink movements from audio, decoupling this aspect from the lip motion.", "A two-stage curriculum learning strategy improves training efficiency and extrapolation capability.

The datasets differ significantly; CREMA features controlled laboratory recordings (7,442 videos from 91 identities, durations 1-5 seconds) and HDTF contains diverse, wild scenarios (410 videos, average duration exceeding 100 seconds).  A variety of metrics are employed to assess different aspects of video quality, including FID, FVD (at 16 and 32 frame windows),  lip-synchronization (LSEC, LSED), identity preservation (CSIM), head motion rhythm (BAS), and blink frequency (blink/s).  The results show that DAWN consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods like Wav2Lip, MakeItTalk, Audio2Head, SadTalker, and Diffused Heads across most metrics on both datasets.
