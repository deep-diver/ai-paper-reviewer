The comparison includes several state-of-the-art methods (SAM, CUSP, AgeTransGAN, FADING) and two versions of the proposed MyTimeMachine method, trained with different lengths of personal photo collections (20-year and 40-year ranges). The evaluation metrics used are Age Mean Absolute Error (AgeMAE), measuring the accuracy of age prediction, and Identity Similarity (IDsim), which indicates how well the re-aged face retains the identity of the original individual.
