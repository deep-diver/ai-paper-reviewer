It emphasizes the recent breakthroughs in LVLMs, particularly proprietary models like GPT-4V, which excel in multi-image understanding.  However, the section points out that open-source LVLMs lag behind, primarily focusing on single-image tasks such as visual question answering.

It addresses the challenges of limited multi-image data and high annotation costs by augmenting single-image data with unrelated images to create diverse multi-image contexts (sequence, grid collage, and pic-in-pic).  The core innovation is an attention-aware selection mechanism that uses the LVLMs' attention values to identify and filter out hallucinated responses without manual annotation or external APIs. This attention-aware selection process constructs chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), enabling effective model training. The approach is further refined with a post-selection process to remove noisy samples based on perplexity, length ratio, and edit distance, ensuring data quality. The method is shown to be compatible with various LVLMs and outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks with an average boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on InternLM-XC2.5, while maintaining comparable performance on single-image tasks.", "first_cons": "The reliance on attention values for filtering out hallucinated responses might be architecture-specific and may not generalize well to all LVLMs. The performance improvements, while significant, are still relatively modest (an average boost of 3-4%).", "first_pros": "The MIA-DPO method significantly reduces the cost and effort associated with creating multi-image training data for preference alignment.
