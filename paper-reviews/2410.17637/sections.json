It emphasizes the increasing importance of LVLMs' ability to understand and effectively process multi-image data, which is crucial for diverse applications like understanding digital documents and web pages where multiple images and texts are interleaved.  The authors point out that while proprietary models like GPT-4 excel at handling multi-image contexts, open-source LVLMs are mainly designed for single-image visual question answering. They further discuss the three typical stages of developing LVLMs: pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and preference alignment (RLHF or RLAIF).  Recent research has focused on improving multi-image capabilities through pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and evaluating multi-image benchmarks. However, existing methods have challenges, including the scarcity of diverse training data, high annotation costs for preference alignment data, and potential adverse effects of multi-image data during SFT on single-image tasks.

It begins by reviewing the background of visual preference alignment and direct preference optimization (DPO), highlighting the challenges of applying existing methods to multi-image scenarios due to data scarcity and annotation costs. The core of the method lies in addressing these challenges through two key innovations:  First, it augments existing single-image data by incorporating unrelated images into multi-image formats (sequence, grid collage, and pic-in-pic), significantly reducing the need for expensive multi-image annotation. Second, it employs an attention-aware selection mechanism to identify and filter out hallucinated responses without relying on human annotation or external models/APIs. The attention mechanism is leveraged to determine which images the model correctly focused on and those it mistakenly interpreted. The chosen and rejected responses then feed into the DPO algorithm to optimize the model's preferences. The entire MIA-DPO pipeline is thus automated, cost-effective, and scalable.", "first_cons": "The reliance on attention weights for data selection might be susceptible to biases inherent in the attention mechanism itself, potentially leading to inaccurate filtering of responses and affecting the DPO process.", "first_pros": "MIA-DPO significantly reduces the cost and effort associated with creating training data for multi-image visual preference alignment by leveraging existing single-image datasets and employing an automated data augmentation and selection process.", "keypoints": ["MIA-DPO addresses the challenge of visual preference alignment in multi-image scenarios, overcoming limitations of existing single-image approaches.", "It introduces a novel data augmentation strategy that extends single-image datasets to multi-image contexts using three different formats (sequence, grid collage, pic-in-pic), significantly reducing annotation costs.", "A key innovation is the attention-aware selection mechanism which leverages attention weights to filter out hallucinated responses, eliminating the need for human annotation or expensive external APIs.", "The method is automated, cost-effective, and scalable, making it suitable for training large LVLMs.", "Experiments on five multi-image benchmarks show average performance improvements of 3.0% on LLaVa-v1.5 and 4.3% on InternLM-XC2.5"], "second_cons": "While MIA-DPO shows promising results, further research is needed to explore the generalizability and robustness of the attention-based selection mechanism across diverse LVLMs and datasets.
