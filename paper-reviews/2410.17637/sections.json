While proprietary models like GPT-4 excel in handling multi-image contexts, open-source models show promise but primarily focus on single-image tasks.  This limitation is problematic because real-world scenarios often involve complex information conveyed through interleaved images and text, as seen in digital documents and web pages. The paper emphasizes that understanding multi-image contexts is crucial for the future development of LVLMs.  The three typical stages of LVLM development\u2014Pre-training, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Preference Alignment (RLHF or RLAIF)\u2014are briefly introduced, along with the existing research efforts focusing on improving multi-image abilities through pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, and new datasets.  However, these approaches face challenges such as data scarcity, high annotation costs, and the potential for hallucinations that are more complex in the multi-image domain, negatively affecting performance on single-image tasks.

It begins by introducing the general concept of visual preference alignment and the direct preference optimization (DPO) approach, highlighting its simplicity and common use. The core of the methodology centers around addressing multi-image hallucinations. The authors analyze two main types: sequence confusion (where the model misidentifies the image being referred to) and element interference (where the model mixes visual elements from different images). They propose using attention values as indicators to identify these hallucinations, creating a novel attention-aware selection mechanism for constructing chosen/rejected pairs for the DPO algorithm.  This method avoids manual annotation or costly external APIs.  The creation of multi-image data is achieved by augmenting single-image data with unrelated images using three formats: sequence, grid collage, and pic-in-pic. The DPO optimization process itself is then detailed, along with the inclusion of a post-selection process to refine the data quality using perplexity, length ratio, and edit distance metrics. The end of the section discusses the overall MIA-DPO framework and its steps.", "first_cons": "The reliance on attention values to detect hallucinations might not be entirely robust, as attention mechanisms can be complex and not always perfectly indicative of the model's understanding.
