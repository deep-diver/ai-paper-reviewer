MIA-DPO (Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization) solves this by cleverly augmenting existing single-image datasets.  It adds unrelated images to create multi-image scenarios, significantly reducing the need for new, expensive annotations.  Furthermore, MIA-DPO cleverly uses the model's own attention weights to identify and filter out incorrect responses, automatically creating high-quality training data.  Experiments show that MIA-DPO substantially improves performance on multiple multi-image benchmarks, with an average improvement of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on InternLM-XC2.5. Importantly, the method doesn't negatively impact the model's ability on single-image tasks, showcasing its robustness and efficiency."}
