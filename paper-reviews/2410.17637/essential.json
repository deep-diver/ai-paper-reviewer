MIA-DPO solves this by cleverly augmenting single-image data with unrelated images, creating multi-image collages. The model's attention mechanism is used to identify and remove erroneous responses, improving data quality without relying on human annotation or expensive APIs.  Testing across five multi-image benchmarks showed an average performance boost of 3% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on InternLM-XC2.5. Importantly, MIA-DPO's improvements in multi-image tasks did not negatively affect its performance on single-image tasks."}
