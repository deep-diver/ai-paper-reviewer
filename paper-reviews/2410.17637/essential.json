Current LVLMs struggle with multi-image data due to limited training data and annotation costs. MIA-DPO tackles this by cleverly augmenting existing single-image datasets with additional, unrelated images. This creates a more diverse training set without the need for extensive new annotations.  The method further leverages the LVLMs' internal attention mechanisms. By analyzing attention patterns, it identifies and filters out less reliable responses where the model focused on the wrong parts of the image, thus creating a better selection of training pairs.  Experiments show MIA-DPO significantly improves performance on five multi-image benchmarks and surprisingly has minimal negative impact on single-image tasks.  In short, MIA-DPO offers a cost-effective and accurate solution for training LVLMs to better handle real-world multi-image scenarios.  It uses readily-available data and the model's own internal attention mechanisms to improve accuracy."}
