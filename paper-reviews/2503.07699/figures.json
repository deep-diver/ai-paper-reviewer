The forward diffusion process begins with a data sample and gradually adds Gaussian noise until it converges to a standard Gaussian distribution. The backward process reverses this, starting from the Gaussian distribution and iteratively removing noise to reconstruct a data sample. The figure visually demonstrates that the expectations for the backward process (denoising) change over timesteps, and that the paths of different samples can overlap which can lead to quality degradation.", "section": "1.

Unlike traditional diffusion models that converge to a single Gaussian distribution, RayFlow guides each sample along a unique trajectory towards an instance-specific target distribution. The forward process adds noise, while the reverse process denoises. The illustration depicts how each sample is guided along its own trajectory, enabling the generation of high-quality images with minimal sampling steps while preserving generation diversity and stability.", "section": "1.

The traditional method shows limitations: varying expectations across timesteps (leading to quality loss in accelerated sampling), overlapping diffusion paths (reducing sampling diversity and causing instability), and overall sampling instability. RayFlow aims to address these through consistent expectations via pre-trained models, guiding each sample on an individual path to reduce overlaps and improve diversity, and achieving theoretical guarantees for improved sampling stability.", "section": "1.

Time Sampler can find the key timesteps (five coordinates) of flow matching.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core concepts of RayFlow and its Time Sampler component.  The left panel depicts the traditional diffusion process, showing how samples traverse a wide range of timesteps before reaching the target distribution. The paths are highly varied and may overlap substantially, leading to issues with stability and sampling quality.  In contrast, the right panel shows the RayFlow process.  Each sample follows a unique path directly toward its instance-specific target distribution.  Note that each trajectory smoothly converges towards its mean instead of transitioning through the typical Gaussian distribution.  This drastically reduces sampling steps. The Time Sampler component is highlighted showing how it identifies key timesteps for training, reducing computational overhead.  These key timesteps (five in this example) are visualized as the coordinates on the simplified diffusion path.", "section": "3.
