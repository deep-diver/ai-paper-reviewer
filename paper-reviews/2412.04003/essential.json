This limitation stems from the scarcity of training data and the inherent difficulty of balancing multiple languages during model training.  This research introduces a novel approach to overcome these issues.\nThe researchers developed Marco-LLM, a multilingual LLM, using a two-stage continual pre-training strategy and a massive multilingual dataset.  This method significantly improved performance on various multilingual benchmarks, showcasing substantial enhancements in any-to-any machine translation tasks.  The study demonstrates the effectiveness of their multilingual training strategy in improving LLM performance across various languages, including those with limited resources.", "affiliation": "Alibaba International Digital Commerce", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.04003/podcast.wav"}
