Current text-to-image models struggle to precisely control specific visual concepts within generated images.  MagicTailor tackles this by enabling 'component-controllable personalization,' allowing users to modify specific parts of a visual concept (like changing only the hairstyle in a portrait, while keeping the other features intact) using additional reference images. This task is very challenging due to 'semantic pollution' (undesired visual elements interfering with the desired result) and 'semantic imbalance' (the model focusing disproportionately on certain elements).  To solve this, MagicTailor uses two key techniques: Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) to selectively remove undesired visual elements in the reference images, and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) to balance the learning process to avoid over-emphasis on any single component.  Extensive experiments show MagicTailor outperforms existing methods in controlling and personalizing visual components. It also demonstrates the ability to work effectively alongside other image generation tools."}
