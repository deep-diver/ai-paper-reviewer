[{"heading_title": "Access, not open", "details": {"summary": "**Access, not open** suggests a shift in perspective from simply making AI systems and their components *available* (open) to ensuring they are *usable* and *beneficial* for a diverse range of stakeholders. It highlights that merely releasing model weights or code doesn't guarantee equitable participation or responsible innovation. **True accessibility** encompasses resourcing (compute, storage), technical usability (interfaces, documentation), and utility (relevance, multilinguality). It calls for addressing practical barriers that prevent individuals and organizations, especially those with limited resources or technical expertise, from engaging with and contributing to the AI ecosystem. This perspective acknowledges that **openness without access** can exacerbate existing inequalities and potentially increase risks, as malicious actors may have an easier time exploiting available resources while marginalized groups are excluded. Ultimately, it underscores the importance of designing AI systems and release strategies that prioritize access alongside openness to maximize benefits and minimize harms."}}, {"heading_title": "Beyond release", "details": {"summary": "**Beyond release** considerations in generative AI systems are critical, extending beyond the simple availability of model weights or code. It encompasses the practical aspects of **access**, including resourcing, technical usability, and utility. Resourcing involves infrastructural needs, while usability concerns technical skills required. Utility covers aspects like multilinguality. Accessibility affects the potential for both beneficial and malicious use, influencing who can deploy and manage the models. Scaling considerations affect the intervention in violations."}}, {"heading_title": "Scalable Access", "details": {"summary": "Scalable access in AI systems is crucial, yet presents multifaceted challenges. **Expanding access** requires careful consideration of resourcing, technical usability, and utility. **Resourcing** includes infrastructural needs and costs, potentially limiting access for some. **Technical usability** determines how diverse users can engage, balancing broader access with potential misuse. **Utility** relates to the capabilities and their impact. Scaling accessibility positively affects usage but also exposes systems to malicious actors, influencing the capacity to manage risk and intervene effectively, highlighting a tension between broader access and manageability."}}, {"heading_title": "Usability levers", "details": {"summary": "**Usability levers** are crucial for AI systems, impacting user engagement. User-friendly interfaces **democratize access**, but also increase the risk of malicious use by less skilled actors. API design affects accessibility, balancing ease of integration with security. Controls like rate limiting are important, but must balance with user experience. **Personal eligibility criteria** may restrict access based on factors like age or location, affecting both safety and fairness. Technical skills for interaction and quality documentation impact system adoption. Latency affects usability, and locally hosted models offer speed improvements. A holistic approach considering both benefits and risks is essential."}}, {"heading_title": "Utility & harm", "details": {"summary": "The paper should deeply investigate the **dual-edged nature of utility**. While increased functionality (multilingual support, multimodal input) broadens accessibility and applicability, it also exposes the system to a wider range of potential misuse scenarios. The analysis must consider the **disproportionate impact of harmful outputs on marginalized groups**. For example, biased outputs in low-resource languages could reinforce existing societal inequalities. Additionally, they must investigate how **differing modalities (text, image, audio)** present unique challenges for content moderation and safety mechanisms. Finally, future research needs to explore **adaptive mitigation strategies** that account for the evolving landscape of utility and associated harms, like model output bias."}}]
