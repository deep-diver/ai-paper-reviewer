Manually creating high-quality training data for this task is expensive and time-consuming. To solve this, the researchers propose a new method called Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT). CIT uses code as a bridge between visual charts and text.  The code translates the visual information in a chart into a textual representation that an LLM can easily understand. Using CIT, they created a new dataset called REACHQA, containing 3,000 charts and 20,000 question-answer pairs.  When LLMs are trained using REACHQA, they perform significantly better on various chart-related benchmarks and even show improvement on general mathematical reasoning tasks. This demonstrates that their method is effective in improving the model's ability to reason with visual information and isn't limited to just charts.  The code and dataset are publicly available, making it easy for other researchers to build upon this work."}
