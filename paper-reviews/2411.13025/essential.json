Existing AI methods primarily focus on model architecture improvements, neglecting the detailed organ-regional information crucial for accurate diagnoses.  This often leads to inaccurate or incomplete reports, increasing radiologists' workload. \nThis paper introduces a novel Organ-Regional Information Driven (ORID) framework to address these issues. **ORID effectively integrates multi-modal data (radiology images and organ-specific descriptions) using a cross-modal fusion module**. It also incorporates an organ importance coefficient analysis module to filter out noise from unrelated organs.  **Experiments show that ORID significantly outperforms existing methods across various evaluation metrics**, proving its effectiveness in generating more accurate and comprehensive radiology reports.", "affiliation": "University of Sydney", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.13025/podcast.wav"}
