Current interpretability methods, like Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), struggle to capture rare but important 'dark matter' concepts in FM representations.  This limits our ability to address potential safety and fairness issues. \nThis paper introduces Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs) to tackle this problem. SSAEs focus on specific subdomains, allowing them to efficiently extract rare features. The researchers use techniques like dense retrieval for data selection and Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization (TERM) for training, enhancing the identification of rare concepts. They demonstrate SSAEs' effectiveness in a case study, showcasing improved accuracy on a bias detection task.  **Overall, SSAEs offer a more effective approach to understanding and controlling rare concepts within FMs, paving the way for safer and more reliable AI systems.**", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
