This process relies heavily on preference datasets, which involve pairing LLM inputs with candidate outputs and human judgments.  A key decision in creating these datasets is determining the source of preference annotations, whether from humans or synthetic sources like other LLMs. This choice significantly impacts the cost and effort of annotation, as well as the performance of models trained on the data. Human annotation, while providing high-quality data, is expensive and time-consuming, and prone to variance.  Synthetic annotations from LMs offer scalability and cost-effectiveness but are susceptible to biases and errors, potentially affecting model performance.

The core idea is to identify instances where human input is most beneficial, thereby maximizing annotation quality while minimizing human effort. This is achieved by formulating the problem as an optimization task: to maximize the performance of a reward model (RM) trained on a hybrid dataset of human and LM annotations.  The framework consists of two primary components: a Performance Prediction Model (PPM) and a routing strategy. The PPM predicts the performance of an RM based on the characteristics of the human-annotated subset. The routing strategy then uses the PPM to simulate various dataset compositions and select the one predicted to yield the highest RM performance. The framework is evaluated using MULTIPREF, a new 10K-instance preference dataset with both human and LM labels, and demonstrates improved RM performance when compared to using either human or LM annotations exclusively.  The approach is further validated through simulations on three other preference datasets, showcasing its generalizability.", "first_cons": "The optimization problem presented is computationally expensive, requiring the training and evaluation of reward models for various dataset combinations.
