The authors suggest leveraging instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's GPT-4, to generate these labels. A prompt-based approach is proposed where the LLM receives a cluster of utterances and is tasked with providing a concise, canonical action label that captures the overall intent, avoiding specific names and quantities. This approach transforms the numerical cluster IDs into human-understandable action labels, greatly aiding the analysis and interpretation of the extracted dialog flows.", "first_cons": "The reliance on LLMs introduces a potential bottleneck in the process, especially given the computational cost and potential variations in LLM responses. The accuracy of the generated labels depends heavily on the quality of the prompt engineering and the LLM's ability to discern the collective intent within a cluster of often varied utterances.", "first_pros": "The method offers a straightforward and scalable approach to label clusters, overcoming the limitation of using only numerical IDs.
