Diffusion-based models improve accuracy but are computationally expensive. Autoregressive models offer efficiency but lack precision.  This paper introduces CARP, a new approach aiming to solve these issues. \nCARP addresses these challenges by employing a two-stage approach: 1) Multi-scale action tokenization creates efficient representations; 2) Coarse-to-fine autoregressive prediction refines actions progressively.  This method achieves competitive accuracy, surpassing or matching existing methods while significantly improving inference speed (up to 10x faster).  This makes it well-suited for resource-constrained real-world robotic applications.", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2412.06782/podcast.wav"}
