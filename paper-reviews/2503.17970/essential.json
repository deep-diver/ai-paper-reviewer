High-resolution images demand substantial computational resources, leading to a tension between maintaining resolution and learning representative features. To solve the issues, this paper proposes **PathoHR, a pipeline enhancing any size of pathological images for effective feature learning**. It incorporates a high-resolution ViT to enhance patch-wise WSI representation and evaluates similarity metrics to optimize representation learning.\n\n**PathoHR\u2019s pipeline enables smaller image patches to achieve equivalent or superior prediction accuracy** compared to raw larger patches, significantly reducing computational overhead. It offers an optimized way of integrating enhanced image resolution with optimized feature learning. It also introduces a streamlined approach for processing enhanced smaller image patches to achieve superior prediction accuracy while reducing computational demands.", "affiliation": "XJLTU", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17970/podcast.wav"}
