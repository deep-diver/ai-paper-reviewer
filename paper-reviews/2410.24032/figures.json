At the top is the CARE System, displaying the Conversation Panel, Solution Panel, and Needs Panel. The CARE System actively prompts the user, gathering their needs before creating a tailored plan.

CARE uses a three-panel interface (Chat, Solution, Needs) to guide users through an iterative process of identifying needs and refining solutions.  The system actively solicits information from the user, clarifying ambiguous requests and ensuring a tailored plan is generated.  In contrast, the baseline system features only a chat panel, responding directly to user queries without proactively eliciting or clarifying needs. This approach tends to produce less personalized and often less satisfactory responses. The figure visually demonstrates the difference in the user experience and interaction style between the two systems.", "section": "4 User Interface"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2410.24032/extracted/5969200/Images/CARE-sys-v2-re.png", "caption": "Figure 2. Overview of the CARE system. The gray area represents the User Interface, where users interact through the Chat, Solution, and Needs Panels.

The top portion illustrates the user interface, which comprises three main panels: the Chat Panel for user-system interaction, the Solution Panel displaying the generated solution, and the Needs Panel for managing and visualizing user needs. The bottom portion shows the backend system, which is a multi-agent collaboration framework. Several LLM-driven agents work together to process user inputs and generate personalized solutions.  These agents include the Inquiry Agent for managing user communication, Needs Discovery Agent for identifying user needs, Solution Craft Agent for generating the solution, Milestone Agent for managing the overall process and setting milestones, and the Ranking Agent for organizing and prioritizing the needs and questions. The various arrows indicate the flow of information between the user, the interface, and the agents. The arrows represent user interactions, internal data flow between agents, agents writing to the interface, and agents retrieving data from the interface.", "section": "4 CARE: Collaborative Assistant for Personalized Exploration"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2410.24032/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 3. Comparative analysis of user responses to the CARE and baseline systems across five key aspects of user experience.", "description": "This figure presents a comparative analysis of user feedback on two systems: CARE and a baseline system.  The analysis focuses on five key aspects of user experience: interaction enjoyment, cognitive load reduction, inspiration for new ideas, solution comprehensiveness, and solution personalization.  For each aspect, the figure displays a bar chart showing the distribution of user responses across a 5-point Likert scale (strongly disagree to strongly agree) for both systems.  Chi-square test results are provided to indicate statistically significant differences between user ratings of the two systems for specific aspects.  The chart visually summarizes the quantitative findings of the user study, showing CARE's perceived benefits over the baseline system.", "section": "Quantitative Results"}]
