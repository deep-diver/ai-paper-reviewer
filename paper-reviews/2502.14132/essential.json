{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it reveals the **critical dependency of community moderation on professional fact-checking**, challenging the narrative that these strategies are independent. Understanding this relationship is essential for developing effective misinformation mitigation strategies and for **assessing the impact of defunding fact-checking organizations**.", "summary": "Community moderation success relies on fact-checking!", "takeaways": ["Community notes cite fact-checking sources more often than previously reported.", "Fact-checking is crucial for notes on posts linked to broader narratives.", "Successful community moderation relies on professional fact-checking."], "tldr": "Two primary strategies combat misinformation on social media: fact-checking by professionals and community moderation. Recent policy shifts suggest a move away from professional fact-checking toward crowdsourced approaches. However, it is unclear how fact-checking efforts and community notes relate. This paper tackles this question by examining Twitter/X's community notes, investigating the connection between fact-checking and community moderation to reveal their shared role. \n\nUsing language models to analyze a large corpus of Twitter/X community notes, the study assesses attributes like topic, cited sources, and whether notes refute broader narratives. Results show that community notes cite fact-checking sources up to five times more than previously thought. Also, fact-checking is especially vital for notes addressing posts connected to wider narratives. The findings suggest that quality community moderation relies on professional fact-checking.", "affiliation": "University of Copenhagen", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14132/podcast.wav"}
