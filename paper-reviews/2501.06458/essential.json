Traditional scaling methods like increasing model size or training data have shown diminishing returns. This paper explores inference-time scaling\u2014increasing the time allowed for reasoning during inference\u2014as a novel approach. \nThe researchers used three medical benchmarks (JAMA, Medbullets, MedQA) to evaluate their method. They found that increasing inference time led to significant performance improvements, particularly for more complex tasks. The study also highlights the potential of \"journey learning,\" a novel technique that trains LLMs to reason step-by-step, mirroring the human thought process. This combined approach resulted in substantial improvements in accuracy and demonstrates the potential of inference-time scaling for building more powerful LLMs for real-world clinical applications.", "affiliation": "OpenAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.06458/podcast.wav"}
