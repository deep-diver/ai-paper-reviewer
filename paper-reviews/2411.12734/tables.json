It compares the performance when only spinning parameters are optimized, when both spinning and grasping parameters are optimized, and when the optimal parameters found for one pen are applied to others.  The results show that optimizing both grasping and spinning parameters leads to the best performance and generalizes well to pens with varying weight distributions and even to non-pen-shaped objects like brushes and screwdrivers.", "section": "V.
