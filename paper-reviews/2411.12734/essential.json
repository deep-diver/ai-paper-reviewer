Existing methods often rely on precise object models and simulations, limiting real-world applicability.  The challenge is amplified with soft robots because of their compliance and the inherent difficulty in precisely modeling their behavior.  Many prior works focused on slow, quasi-static tasks.\nThis paper introduces SWIFT, a system that learns to dynamically spin a pen using a soft robotic hand. Instead of relying on simulations or precise object models, SWIFT uses real-world trial-and-error learning.  The system identifies optimal grasping and spinning parameters enabling the soft hand to successfully spin the pen robustly and reliably.  This success was demonstrated across three pens with varied properties, proving the method's adaptability.  Furthermore, the approach generalized well to spinning other objects, showing versatility.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2411.12734/podcast.wav"}
