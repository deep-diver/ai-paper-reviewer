[{"heading_title": "Arabic Embeddings", "details": {"summary": "The research paper explores the development of **Swan**, a family of Arabic embedding models designed to address limitations of existing multilingual models in capturing Arabic linguistic and cultural nuances.  Swan offers two variants: a smaller model based on ARBERTv2 and a larger one built on ArMistral, a pretrained Arabic large language model.  **ArabicMTEB**, a comprehensive benchmark suite, is introduced to evaluate these models across diverse tasks and datasets, showcasing Swan-Large's state-of-the-art performance.  The study highlights Swan's **dialectal and cultural awareness**, demonstrating its superior performance in various Arabic domains while offering **monetary efficiency**. The focus on Arabic-specific models and benchmarks represents a significant advancement in Arabic NLP, providing valuable resources for future research and applications."}}, {"heading_title": "Swan Model", "details": {"summary": "The Swan model, introduced in this research paper, is a family of Arabic-centric embedding models designed to address both small-scale and large-scale applications.  It encompasses two main variants: **Swan-Small**, based on ARBERTv2, and **Swan-Large**, built on the ArMistral pretrained large language model.  A key strength of Swan is its **dialect-aware** and **culturally aware** nature, excelling in various Arabic domains while maintaining efficiency.  The models' performance is rigorously evaluated using a comprehensive benchmark, ArabicMTEB, demonstrating state-of-the-art results on several Arabic NLP tasks. The availability of both a small and large variant ensures applicability across diverse computational resource constraints, making Swan a significant contribution to Arabic NLP."}}, {"heading_title": "ArabicMTEB", "details": {"summary": "ArabicMTEB is a **comprehensive benchmark** designed to evaluate Arabic text embedding models.  Unlike existing benchmarks that often lack sufficient Arabic coverage or neglect dialectal and cultural nuances, ArabicMTEB offers a **holistic assessment** using 94 datasets across eight diverse tasks. These tasks include **Arabic text retrieval**, **bitext mining**, **cross-lingual retrieval**, **re-ranking**, **semantic textual similarity**, **classification**, **pair classification**, and **clustering**.  The benchmark's strength lies in its ability to evaluate models across various linguistic aspects, including MSA and multiple dialects, and cultural domains, providing a **more realistic and applicable assessment** of embedding model capabilities for real-world Arabic NLP applications. Its inclusion of domain-specific and culturally aware datasets further enhances its value for researchers seeking to develop robust and nuanced Arabic language technologies."}}, {"heading_title": "Benchmarking", "details": {"summary": "The benchmarking section of the research paper introduces **ArabicMTEB**, a novel and comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate Arabic text embedding models.
