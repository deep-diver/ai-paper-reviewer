[{"heading_title": "Code-Guided Gen", "details": {"summary": "The work focuses on **code-guided generation (CoSyn)** of synthetic multimodal data. The core idea is to utilize code as an intermediate representation to bridge images and text, where text-only LLMs, known for code generation, are prompted to produce code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) that renders synthetic images. This code then serves as context for LLMs to generate corresponding textual instructions, enabling the creation of high-quality instruction-tuning data for VLMs. This is especially useful in text-rich domains, since such images are typically rendered from code and this approach provides grounded instructions."}}, {"heading_title": "Text-Rich Scaling", "details": {"summary": "Scaling text-rich image understanding is crucial for advancing VLMs. The scarcity of diverse data in this domain hinders progress. **CoSyn addresses this by leveraging text-only LLMs to generate synthetic multimodal data**. The approach involves coding images, enabling high-quality instruction tuning. The goal is to improve VLMs' ability to interpret and reason about text-rich images, unlocking their potential for real-world applications. This scaling enhances VLMs in understanding text-rich images and unlocks their potential for broader applications. **Synthetic data generation offers a path to overcome data limitations**."}}, {"heading_title": "CoSyn Framework", "details": {"summary": "CoSyn, the code-guided synthetic data generation framework, **addresses the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data**, a critical bottleneck for VLMs. It **leverages the coding capabilities of text-only LLMs** to create synthetic multimodal data automatically. The framework, driven by short natural language queries, prompts an LLM to generate code in languages like Python or HTML. This code is used to render synthetic images. The **underlying code becomes a textual representation of the images**. The system generates high-quality instruction-tuning data by again relying on a text-only LLM, with **the code serving as context**. CoSyn's architecture enables the creation of a targeted dataset, enhancing the VLM performance."}}, {"heading_title": "Synthetic VLMs", "details": {"summary": "The concept of \"Synthetic VLMs,\" while not explicitly a heading in this document, can be interpreted as the core idea of using synthetically generated data to train Vision-Language Models (VLMs). The research **leverages the coding capabilities of LLMs to create diverse text-rich multimodal data**. This addresses the **limitation of high-quality, realistic, and diverse vision-language datasets** which often hinders VLM performance, particularly in tasks requiring text and spatial reasoning. By generating data and code, the system offers high-quality instruction-tuning data, enabling VLMs to learn effectively in domains where real data is scarce. Ultimately, this approach unlocks the potential of VLMs for real-world applications, where understanding text-rich images is crucial."}}, {"heading_title": "Pointing Agents", "details": {"summary": "While not explicitly discussed, the paper implicitly touches on pointing agents through its exploration of multimodal understanding and code-guided synthetic data generation. **CoSyn's ability to create synthetic pointing data**, as seen in the ScreenSpot experiments, suggests its potential for training agents that can interact with and ground themselves in visual environments. This highlights the framework's value in **developing agents capable of performing tasks** such as object recognition, navigation, and decision-making based on visual cues, opening avenues for real-world applications like robotics and autonomous systems."}}]
