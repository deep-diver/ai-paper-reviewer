{"importance": "This paper is important because it presents a novel method for animating 3D objects using text prompts, achieving high-quality results while preserving the original object's identity.  This addresses a significant gap in current 4D content generation techniques by allowing users to easily animate their existing 3D assets, opening new avenues for research in virtual worlds, gaming, media, and beyond. **The proposed method also introduces technical improvements like an incremental viewpoint selection protocol and masked SDS loss, contributing valuable insights to the broader field of generative modeling.**", "summary": "3to4D: Animate any 3D object with text prompts, preserving visual quality and achieving realistic motion!", "takeaways": ["3to4D animates user-provided 3D objects by conditioning on textual prompts, generating high-fidelity 4D animations.", "The method introduces an incremental viewpoint selection protocol and a masked SDS loss, improving motion realism and object identity preservation.", "3to4D outperforms existing methods in temporal coherence, prompt adherence, and visual fidelity."], "tldr": "Current text-to-4D methods lack control over the appearance of generated 4D content and often significantly alter the input object when introducing dynamics. This paper introduces 3to4D, a novel method that animates user-provided 3D objects while preserving their visual identity.  It uses a two-stage process: first, it creates a static 4D representation of the object, then uses an image-to-video diffusion model to animate the object based on a text prompt. \n\nTo improve the realism of the generated animations, 3to4D introduces an incremental viewpoint selection protocol and a masked SDS loss. The incremental viewpoint selection gradually increases the viewpoint diversity during the generation process, which enhances the dynamic motion, while the masked SDS loss focuses the optimization on the relevant parts of the object, maintaining the original identity. This approach allows users to generate high-quality 4D animations that are both visually appealing and consistent with the input object and the text description. **The experimental results demonstrate that 3to4D outperforms baseline methods in terms of visual quality and dynamic realism,** effectively bridging the gap between static 3D assets and animated 4D content.", "affiliation": "Bar-Ilan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.20422/podcast.wav"}
