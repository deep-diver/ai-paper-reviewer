NaturalBench provides a more rigorous and reliable way to evaluate VLMs, driving innovation and guiding future research in the field.", "summary": "NaturalBench: a new benchmark exposes VLMs' vulnerabilities to natural adversarial samples, highlighting compositionality challenges & bias issues, and promoting dynamic VLM evaluation.", "takeaways": ["NaturalBench, a new benchmark, effectively evaluates VLMs using natural adversarial samples.", "VLMs struggle with compositional reasoning and exhibit significant biases, as revealed by NaturalBench.", "NaturalBench's design facilitates dynamic evaluation, adapting to new data sources and model advancements."], "tldr": "Existing vision-language model (VLM) benchmarks are shown to be easily solved by models that don't even look at the images, relying on language biases instead.  This paper introduces NaturalBench, a new benchmark designed to overcome these limitations.  NaturalBench uses pairs of images and questions where the same question has different answers depending on the image. This forces models to actually use visual information.  They create the benchmark semi-automatically, starting with image-text pairs where existing models (like CLIP) make errors.  They then use ChatGPT to generate questions for these pairs of images that have different answers.  Human evaluation is used to filter the results and ensure quality.  Testing many state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that even the best models are far from human-level performance.  They also show that the benchmark highlights problems with model biases and a lack of compositional reasoning skills.  Finally, they demonstrate the benchmark can easily adapt to new data sources, making it suitable for continuously evaluating model progress."}
