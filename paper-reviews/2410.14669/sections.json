To overcome these limitations, a novel semi-automated approach is introduced. This involves first identifying image-text pairs that are incorrectly matched by leading VLMs like CLIP, then using ChatGPT to generate questions eliciting different answers for those image pairs.  Human annotators are employed to verify the accuracy of the generated questions and answers, removing flawed samples.  This process is contrasted with previous methods which often involved more extensive and expensive manual annotation.  The resulting dataset is NaturalBench, which features 5,800 yes-or-no and 1,800 multiple-choice VQA samples in its initial release, surpassing the scale of many recent benchmarks.  The paper emphasizes the vision-centric design of the benchmark, where each question is paired with two images yielding different answers, actively preventing \"blind\" solutions.
