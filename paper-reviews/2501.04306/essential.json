This survey reveals their transformative potential across hypothesis discovery, experiment planning, writing, and peer review, guiding future research.", "takeaways": ["LLMs significantly enhance multiple stages of scientific research, offering unprecedented support.", "Current LLM applications in scientific research face several challenges including limitations in handling complex tasks and ethical issues.", "Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring new ways to integrate LLMs into scientific workflows."], "tldr": "The scientific research process, while effective, is often hampered by time constraints, human limitations, and resource scarcity. This paper explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can address these limitations by automating various stages of research, from hypothesis generation and experiment planning to writing and peer review.  Existing efforts have used LLMs for literature-based discovery and inductive reasoning tasks, demonstrating potential for novel findings.\nThis research systematically analyzes the role of LLMs in the four main stages of scientific research. It presents task-specific methodologies and evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the transformative potential of LLMs while also identifying current challenges and offering insights into future research directions. The survey concludes that LLMs, although limited by several factors, show promise for revolutionizing various research processes and boosting productivity. This work provides a comprehensive overview of current developments and serves as a guide for the wider scientific community interested in incorporating LLMs into scientific research.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Dallas", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.04306/podcast.wav"}
