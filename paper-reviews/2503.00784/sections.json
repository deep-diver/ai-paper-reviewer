It seeks to enhance draft quality and reduce computational costs. This involves adjusting drafting length and sequence numbers, using metrics like uncertainty to guide decisions. A core idea is to use the draft model's probabilities as a proxy for accuracy, influencing the decision to explore diverse candidate tokens. By varying drafting strategies based on context and generation stages, it aims to achieve better performance across diverse tasks. Different from static sequences, it improves overall efficiency by leveraging dynamic adaptations."}}, {"heading_title": "TTFT Reduction", "details": {"summary": "Reducing Time To First Token (TTFT) is crucial for interactive applications using Large Language Models(LLMs). While speculative decoding boosts overall generation speed, it often introduces overhead that can increase TTFT. **This overhead stems from the initial drafting process**, which requires additional computation before the first verified token can be produced. Effectively mitigating this requires **careful optimization of the drafting stage**. Strategies might involve lightweight draft models, parallel processing, or caching mechanisms to minimize the initial delay. A reduction in TTFT ensures a more responsive and user-friendly experience, especially for real-time interactions."}}, {"heading_title": "Budgeting Tradeoffs", "details": {"summary": "In the context of DuoDecoding, a strategic resource allocation is crucial for optimal performance. The **'Budgeting Tradeoffs'** encapsulates the delicate balance between drafting and verification processes. A higher drafting budget allows the draft model to generate more candidate tokens, potentially uncovering longer sequences and greater acceleration. However, this comes at the risk of diminishing returns, where later tokens in a long draft sequence exhibit lower acceptance rates, thereby wasting computational resources. Conversely, a smaller budget restricts the potential for acceleration, limiting the number of speculated tokens verified in parallel. Finding the optimal budget point necessitates careful consideration of hardware capabilities and model characteristics. It also involves a dynamic adaptation of the budget based on real-time feedback on draft quality. **A hardware-aware strategy dynamically adjusts the drafting budget** to keep both CPU and GPU busy. A larger drafting budget can result in the GPU sitting idle. There is less time needed for the target model, resulting in an inefficient outcome. However, **too small a budget** the inverse is true: the **CPU remains inactive**."}}, {"heading_title": "Hetero Decoding", "details": {"summary": "**Heterogeneous decoding** could involve strategically using different decoding algorithms or model architectures within a single system to optimize for various criteria like speed, accuracy, or resource consumption. For example, a **smaller, faster model** might generate initial drafts, while a **larger, more accurate model** refines or verifies the output. This approach could leverage specialized hardware, dedicating certain processing units (like CPUs or GPUs) to specific decoding tasks. The strategy would aim to balance computational load and ensure high-quality output, potentially adapting the decoding process dynamically based on input complexity or available resources. The core goal is to achieve efficiency without compromising the integrity or quality of the generated content."}}]
