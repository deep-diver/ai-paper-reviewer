The benchmark includes three levels of tasks: basic CBT knowledge acquisition, cognitive model understanding (including cognitive distortion and core belief classification), and therapeutic response generation. Evaluation of several LLMs revealed that while they perform well on basic knowledge tasks, they struggle with more complex tasks demanding deep understanding of patient cognitive structures and generation of effective therapeutic responses. This gap highlights the need for further development of LLMs to enhance their ability to effectively assist professional CBT practitioners.</div><a class="!rounded-md bg-primary-600 px-4 py-2 !text-neutral !no-underline hover:!bg-primary-500 dark:bg-primary-800 dark:hover:!bg-primary-700" href=https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13218 target=_self role=button><span class="relative inline-block align-text-bottom icon"><svg width="800" height="800" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M7.05025 1.53553C8.03344.552348 9.36692.0 10.7574.0 13.6528.0 16 2.34721 16 5.24264 16 6.63308 15.4477 7.96656 14.4645 8.94975L12.4142 11 11 9.58579l2.0503-2.05026C13.6584 6.92742 14 6.10264 14 5.24264 14 3.45178 12.5482 2 10.7574 2c-.86004.0-1.68482.34163-2.29293.94975L6.41421 5 5 3.58579 7.05025 1.53553z" fill="#000"/><path d="M7.53553 13.0503 9.58579 11 11 12.4142 8.94975 14.4645C7.96656 15.4477 6.63308 16 5.24264 16 2.34721 16 0 13.6528.0 10.7574.0 9.36693.552347 8.03344 1.53553 7.05025L3.58579 5 5 6.41421 2.94975 8.46447C2.34163 9.07258 2 9.89736 2 10.7574 2 12.5482 3.45178 14 5.24264 14c.86.0 1.68478-.3416 2.29289-.9497z" fill="#000"/><path d="M5.70711 11.7071 11.7071 5.70711 10.2929 4.29289 4.29289 10.2929l1.41422 1.4142z" fill="#000"/></svg>

I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and I had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me.

I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Thoughts: I am a bad mother. This is my fault. It is so shameful that my daughter has bipolar. If my daughter gets worse, then it will be my fault for not getting her into treatment. I need to do something.

I took full responsibility for it, but I'm aware that my actions, such as hiding my depression from her and seeing a psychologist without her knowledge, were not acceptable. I felt that she wouldn't understand because she's always belittled my emotions, accusing me of exaggerating and seeking attention whenever I express myself emotionally. This led me to feel ashamed and afraid of facing her criticism, so I chose to keep my struggles hidden. Thoughts: I'm a failure for lying and hiding things from my mom.

Thoughts: Because my anxiety felt worse before, this must be a normal level of anxiety and paranoia, so my conclusions make more sense. People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly. I at least wear makeup so they can't see how ugly I am, and ifI avoid people altogether, then they won't know how much of a loser I am or how boring I am. I don't like who I am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than I think it is.</td><td>Overgeneralization</td><td>The model focuses on the client's fear of judgment and anxiety in social situations rather than recognizing the gen- eralized, negative self-beliefs in- dicated by "People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly".</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: It's all my fault most likely all I do is constantly worry about everything. Thoughts: I should be able to control others around me, and when I can't, I cope with it by worrying. If someone is making decisions I disagree with, I should worry. There is something wrong with me that I can't control others.

This has been getting worse over time.

The model's misidentification as "personal- ization" (taking excessive per- sonal responsibility) could stem from misinterpreting the client's statements.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I am struggling at the moment and yet I am aware that I should be feeling good. Thoughts: What I am feeling and going through is unacceptable and wrong. There is a right and wrong way to go through this and I am doing it the wrong way.</td><td>All-or-nothing thinking</td><td>The core issue lies more in self- judgment and difficulty accept- ing emotional experiences, not binary thinking. The misidentifi- cation by the model could occur because both patterns involve rigid judgments.</td></tr><tr><td>Situation: I am finding younger girls sexually arousing. Thoughts: I am worried about whether or not this will go away later in life, this is horrible, and I even feel guilty constantly, I cannot help it.</td><td>magnification</td><td>This patient is merely express- ing reasonable concerns based on their current situation; it is rational and not an unjustified exaggeration.
