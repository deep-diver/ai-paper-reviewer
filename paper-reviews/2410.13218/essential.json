Level 1 tests basic CBT knowledge; Level 2 evaluates cognitive model understanding (identifying distortions and core beliefs); and Level 3 assesses therapeutic response generation in simulated therapy sessions.  The study uses multiple-choice questions and newly created datasets (CBT-QA, CBT-CD, CBT-PC, CBT-FC, CBT-DP) to evaluate several LLMs. Results show LLMs excel at Level 1 (knowledge recall), but performance drops significantly in Levels 2 and 3 (complex reasoning and therapeutic responses).  This underscores the limitations of current LLMs in handling the nuanced aspects of CBT and indicates promising areas for future research focusing on improving LLMs' abilities in complex real-world scenarios."}
