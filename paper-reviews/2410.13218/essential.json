CBT-BENCH features three levels of difficulty: basic CBT knowledge, cognitive model understanding (identifying cognitive distortions and core beliefs), and therapeutic response generation.  Experiments using six popular LLMs showed that while LLMs perform well on basic knowledge questions, they struggle with more complex tasks that involve analyzing patient cognitive structures and creating effective therapeutic responses.  The results highlight the limitations of current LLMs in real-world CBT applications and suggest potential directions for future work, emphasizing the need for models capable of deeper cognitive understanding and more nuanced, human-like interactions."}
