Existing tools are often complex, requiring significant expertise to use effectively, and even experienced users often struggle with accuracy. Large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating this process, but struggle with accuracy and need iterative debugging. \n\nPlotGen tackles these issues by using a multi-agent system powered by LLMs.  It breaks down complex user requests into smaller tasks, generates code, and then uses three feedback agents (numerical, lexical, and visual) to iteratively refine the visualization based on multimodal feedback.  This iterative refinement significantly improves accuracy and reduces debugging time, making the process much easier for novice users and ultimately improving their productivity. The results demonstrate that PlotGen outperforms other methods, showing the effectiveness of its approach.", "affiliation": "IGDTUW, Delhi", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.00988/podcast.wav"}
