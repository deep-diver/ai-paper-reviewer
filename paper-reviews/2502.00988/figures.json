PlotGen generates accurate scientific data visualizations based on user specifications by orchestrating multimodal LLMs: (1) Query Planning Agent that breaks down complex user requests into executable steps; (2) Code Generation Agent that converts pseudocode into executable Python code; and three code retrieval feedback agents\u2014(3) Numeric Feedback Agent, (4) Lexical Feedback Agent, and (5) Visual Feedback Agent\u2014that leverage multimodal LLMs to iteratively refine the data accuracy, textual labels, and visual aesthetics of generated plots via self-reflection.", "description": "PlotGen uses multiple large language models (LLMs) working together to create visualizations from user requests.  A Query Planning Agent breaks down the request into steps. A Code Generation Agent turns those steps into Python code. Three feedback agents (Numeric, Lexical, and Visual) use multimodal LLMs to check the accuracy of the data, text, and appearance of the generated plot, making iterative improvements via self-reflection.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
