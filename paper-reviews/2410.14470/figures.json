[{"figure_path": "2410.14470/figures/figures_2_0.png", "caption": "Figure 1: Training methods determine what layers become critical. We measure the criticality of fifty different ResNet-50-based models that all utilize the same exact network architecture and training data (ImageNet-1k) but differ in their training methods. Darker spots denote layers that are critical, i.e., in significantly different predictions and decreased performance after reset. Brighter spots are auxiliary, i.e., resetting these layers does not significantly affect the model. We denote the average (mean\u00b1std) layer criticality for both, a model across layers on the right, for a layer across model on the bottom.", "description": "The figure shows how different training methods affect which layers of a ResNet-50 model are critical to the model's decision-making process.", "section": "3 Results"}]
