PURE incorporates reviews, ratings, and item interactions, whereas LLM Recommender handles only item interactions. By using the \"Review Extractor\" to identify key information and the \"Profile Updater\" to refine the user profile, PURE addresses scalability issue (i.e.,\u00a0growth of input token size).", "description": "PURE (Profile Update for REcommender) is a novel LLM-based recommendation framework.  Unlike traditional LLM recommenders that only use purchase history, PURE incorporates user reviews and ratings to build more comprehensive user profiles. The figure illustrates PURE's three key components: a Review Extractor that processes reviews to extract user preferences, dislikes, and key product features; a Profile Updater that refines and updates the user profile, resolving redundancies and conflicts; and a Recommender that generates personalized recommendations based on the enriched user profile.  This approach mitigates the scalability challenges (large input token sizes) associated with processing extensive user data by systematically extracting and summarizing key information.", "section": "3 Method"}]
