{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in computer vision and AI because it introduces **MARVEL-40M+**, a massive, high-quality dataset for text-to-3D generation, addressing the limitations of existing datasets.  It also presents **MARVEL-FX3D**, a novel two-stage pipeline for high-fidelity text-to-3D that is significantly faster than existing approaches. This opens up exciting new avenues for research into more realistic and efficient 3D content creation from textual descriptions.", "summary": "MARVEL-40M+ & MARVEL-FX3D: 40M+ high-quality 3D annotations & a fast two-stage text-to-3D pipeline enabling high-fidelity 3D model generation within 15 seconds.", "takeaways": ["MARVEL-40M+ dataset: a massive resource for text-to-3D generation with 40 million high-quality annotations.", "MARVEL-FX3D pipeline: a fast and efficient two-stage pipeline achieving high-fidelity text-to-3D model generation within 15 seconds.", "Multi-level annotation approach: a novel hierarchical annotation structure supporting both fine-grained reconstruction and rapid prototyping."], "tldr": "Current text-to-3D (T23D) content creation struggles with limited, low-quality datasets and computationally expensive methods.  The lack of high-fidelity, detailed 3D annotations severely restricts the development of advanced T23D models, particularly for complex scenes.  Existing datasets are small, lack diversity and have insufficient annotation depth.\nThis paper introduces MARVEL-40M+, a novel dataset with 40 million high-quality annotations spanning seven major 3D datasets. These multi-level annotations support both fine-grained and abstract 3D modeling.  The paper also presents MARVEL-FX3D, a two-stage pipeline for generating textured 3D meshes from text in 15 seconds using fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and a pretrained image-to-3D network.  Results show that MARVEL-40M+ significantly surpasses existing datasets and MARVEL-FX3D outperforms current state-of-the-art T23D methods.", "affiliation": "DFKI", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2411.17945/podcast.wav"}
