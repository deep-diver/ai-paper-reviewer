Neural Fields (NFs), offering continuous, differentiable mappings of space to physical quantities, are presented as a promising alternative.  NFs' continuous nature enables high-fidelity 3D reconstruction and efficient multi-sensor integration, leading to better performance in tasks such as pose estimation and navigation.\nThis survey paper systematically reviews the literature on NFs in robotics, categorizing applications across several domains (pose estimation, manipulation, navigation, physics, and autonomous driving).  It provides in-depth analysis of four core NF frameworks and presents a detailed taxonomy of existing NF robotics applications.  Finally, it discusses the current limitations and proposes promising directions for future research, paving the way for more robust and adaptable robots using NFs.  **The paper's core contribution is its thorough review and classification of existing NF applications in robotics, offering valuable insights and a clear roadmap for future research.**"}
