Existing methods often rely on easily accessible geometric cues, leading to a \u201cgeometric shortcut\u201d that prevents learning robust representations. This results in poor performance when evaluated with linear probing, a standard measure of representation quality. Current SSL models collapse to low-level spatial features. This is due to the 3D point cloud operators and easily accessible normal direction or point height.\n\nThis paper introduces a new SSL framework that addresses the geometric shortcut by obscuring spatial information and emphasizing input features. The approach involves applying SSL losses at coarser spatial scales, using a point self-distillation framework, and employing scaling techniques. The resulting model demonstrates strong zero-shot capabilities and achieves exceptional parameter and data efficiency. It significantly improves linear probing accuracy and achieves SOTA results across various 3D perception tasks. They trained on 140k point clouds through self-distillation.
