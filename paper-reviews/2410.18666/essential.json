Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, hindering the development of robust models.  Furthermore, collecting real-world paired data for training is laborious and raises copyright and privacy concerns. Web scraping, a common data acquisition method, often involves copyright infringement and privacy violations. \nThis paper introduces a dual strategy to address these issues.  First, it presents GenIR, a privacy-safe data curation pipeline. GenIR uses text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) to create high-quality, privacy-safe images and their corresponding text descriptions. This is followed by a dual-prompt learning stage to fine-tune the model for IR and filtering the generated data based on quality and compliance.  The resulting dataset comprises one million high-quality images. Second, a new high-capacity model called DreamClear is presented which utilizes the generative priors of T2I models and multimodal LLMs for superior image restoration results. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks."}
