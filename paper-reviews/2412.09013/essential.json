Existing diffusion model-based SR methods often involve complex optimization or fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and flexibility.  Furthermore, fixed sampling steps hinder adaptability to diverse degradation types. \nThis paper introduces InvSR, a novel SR technique based on diffusion inversion.  Instead of modifying the diffusion network, InvSR uses a deep noise predictor to estimate optimal noise maps, initializing the sampling process and generating high-resolution images.  This approach allows for **arbitrary sampling steps**, providing great flexibility and efficiency, making it suitable for various degradation types.  InvSR shows competitive or superior performance to existing methods, even with a single sampling step.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.09013/podcast.wav"}
