(a) MarDini achieves optimal generation performance with few inference steps using the DDIM solver; (b) As training progresses, MarDini shows improvement in the tasks of both video interpolation and image-to-video. These results are based on a mask ratio ranging from 0.15 to 0.6 for 9-frame generation; and (c) The design of Identity Attention is crucial for stable training convergence in MarDini during the initial training stage; without it, the model fails to converge.", "description": "Figure 6 shows MarDini's training and inference performance, illustrating its optimal generation with few inference steps, improved performance with training progress, and the importance of Identity Attention for stable training.", "section": "3.1 Ablation Studies and Analysis"}]
