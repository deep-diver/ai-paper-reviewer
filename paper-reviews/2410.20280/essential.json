Autoregressive models are difficult to apply to high-dimensional visual data, while diffusion models are computationally expensive.  This paper introduces MarDini, a new video generation model addressing these limitations. \nMarDini uses a clever strategy. It combines masked autoregression (MAR) for temporal planning (deciding what happens when) and diffusion models (DM) for spatial generation (creating the image).  MAR works with low-resolution data, significantly reducing computational cost, while DM handles high-resolution image generation.  **This asymmetric design, combined with a progressive training strategy, allows MarDini to achieve state-of-the-art performance in video interpolation and image-to-video generation, efficiently and at scale.**"}
