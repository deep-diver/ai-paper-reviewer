Existing diffusion models can produce high-quality completed scenes but are computationally expensive, hindering real-time applications.  This creates a critical need for methods that balance speed and accuracy. \n\nThis research introduces ScoreLiDAR, a novel distillation method designed to accelerate the LiDAR scene completion process.  ScoreLiDAR leverages a pre-trained diffusion model and incorporates a Structural Loss to ensure high-quality outputs.  The results demonstrate a significant speedup (over 5x) without compromising accuracy, paving the way for real-time, accurate scene understanding in autonomous systems.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.03515/podcast.wav"}
