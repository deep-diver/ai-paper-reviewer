Unlike traditional methods that require extensive manual annotation of each video frame, SMITE leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and a small set of reference images (one or a few) to segment unseen videos. This significantly reduces the need for manual labeling.  The method incorporates a tracking mechanism and low-frequency regularization to ensure that the segmentations are temporally consistent and don't flicker.  Experiments on a new dataset, SMITE-50, and existing benchmarks demonstrate that SMITE outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of both accuracy and temporal consistency, handling pose changes, occlusions, and variations in color. User studies confirmed its effectiveness.  SMITE offers a flexible solution for videos needing consistent segmentation across frames (e.g., VFX) without requiring extensive frame-by-frame labeling for every video."}
