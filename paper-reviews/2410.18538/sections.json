This challenge is exacerbated by the requirement for *flexible granularity*, where the number of segments can vary arbitrarily, and masks are defined from only one or a few sample images. The current methods struggle due to the inherent complexity of the task and the lack of suitable datasets that can accommodate flexible segmentation granularities. Creating comprehensive datasets for every possible segmentation scenario is extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive, highlighting the need for new approaches that can learn from limited reference images.  The authors introduce the concept of *flexible granularity segmentation*, where segmentations are based on a reference image, thereby circumventing the need for extensive manual annotation of videos. This sets the stage for introducing their proposed SMITE method, which aims to overcome the limitations of existing techniques and efficiently perform video segmentation with varying levels of granularities using limited references.

In part-based semantic segmentation, the challenge lies in assigning class labels to each pixel while also delineating individual object components.  Traditional methods often rely on extensive manual annotation, limiting scalability. Recent approaches leverage open-vocabulary part segmentation, using foundation models to help with the annotation problem.  However, these approaches usually only segment parts that are semantically described by text.  Stable Diffusion (SD)-based generative segmentation models have made progress in this area, allowing for the segmentation of semantic parts at any level of detail, even without text descriptions.  The review then transitions to video segmentation, categorizing existing methods into video semantic segmentation (VSS), video instance segmentation (VIS), and video object segmentation (VOS).  These methods commonly leverage temporal correlations using techniques like temporal attention, optical flow, and spatio-temporal memory to ensure consistent labeling across video frames.  However, these approaches often struggle with fine-grained part segmentation and generalization to unseen datasets.
