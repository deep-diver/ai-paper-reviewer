The complexity arises from variations within a single object (scale, deformations), within the object class (shape, appearance), and in imaging conditions (lighting, viewpoint). The current methods require extensive and time-consuming manual annotation to create comprehensive datasets for every possible segmentation scenario.  The paper introduces a novel method, dubbed SMITE (SEGMENT ME IN TIME), to address this, focusing on segmenting videos based on a reference image or a few images, eliminating the need for manual video segmentation and making the process significantly more efficient.

To address these limitations, several approaches are mentioned, including those using open-vocabulary part segmentation and foundation models to assist in part segmentation, even without explicit text descriptions.  The discussion then shifts to video segmentation, highlighting the added complexities of temporal consistency and maintaining label accuracy across frames.

This allows for temporal attention across the entire video, enhancing temporal coherence.  3x3 convolutional kernels are changed to 1x3x3 to introduce a pseudo-temporal channel, improving the model's ability to capture the temporal aspects of videos.  Cross-attention layers incorporate semantic contexts from the prompt embeddings, while self-attention layers leverage global information from the latent representations of the video frames.\n- **Segment Tracking and Voting:** A tracking module (CoTracker) maintains label consistency across frames. It tracks segments across time by tracking points of interest and projecting them onto attention maps.  A voting mechanism is used to update segment labels; the most frequent label in a sliding window is assigned to a pixel for temporal consistency.  A frequency-based regularizer also helps ensure that adjustments align with the reference segment structure.\n- **Low-pass Regularization:** A low-pass filter (LPF) is applied to the initial denoising step to preserve the overall structure of the segments while smoothing boundary transitions. This maintains temporal coherence and reduces flickering.  The filter is applied using a discrete cosine transform (DCT).\n- **Energy-Based Guidance Optimization:** The tracking and regularization energies are combined in an energy function to balance the conflicting forces of tracking and segment structure maintenance, preventing undesirable deviations.\n- **Training Strategy:** The model is trained in two phases.
