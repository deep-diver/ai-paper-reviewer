A strong model (Llama 3.1 70B) paired with a weaker model (Llama 3.1 8B) leads to order dependence. Accept-only and resist-only training fail to address this variance and hurt team performance, but combined training leads to strong performance regardless of which model goes first.", "description": "The chart displays the impact of different training methods (base, accept-only, resist-only, and PBT) on the accuracy of two-model teams in a debate setting, showing how PBT improves team performance and reduces order dependence.", "section": "4.3 RQ3: Building Effective LLM Teams"}, {"figure_path": "2410.14596/charts/charts_7_1.png", "caption": "Figure 4: Baseline and team performance for Base-Base, Base-Accept, and Base-PBT teams.
