Existing work has predominantly concentrated on the negative aspects of persuasion, such as the susceptibility of LLMs to misinformation and the phenomenon of \"flip-flopping\", where a model changes its answer simply by being questioned.  Studies have shown that adversarial users can exploit these weaknesses to manipulate LLMs into revealing private information or generating harmful text, highlighting the critical need for enhanced robustness against adversarial persuasion.  The work cited in this section underscores that LLMs, while capable of impressive feats, remain vulnerable to subtle manipulation.  The section also mentions a recent trend in research: the importance of incorporating positive persuasion, to enhance the model's ability to adapt and improve its responses by accepting valid suggestions and arguments. This implies a move towards creating LLMs capable of balanced interaction, resisting harmful influences while remaining receptive to beneficial ones.\n\n### Knowledge Updating and Conflict\n\nThe paper also relates the current work to the broader fields of knowledge updating and conflict resolution within LLMs. This involves studies that analyze how LLMs integrate new textual evidence and handle contradictions between previously held knowledge and new information.  The connection to knowledge conflict is specifically noted, where the models receive information that contradicts existing knowledge within their context. The cited research highlights the models' tendency to be influenced by contextual information, regardless of its credibility, which is a phenomenon that can be mitigated through the methods presented in the current paper.\n\n### Persuasion in LLMs and PBT\n\nThis section implicitly highlights the limitations of previous research, which tends to overemphasize negative persuasion, ignoring the equally important aspect of accepting positive persuasion. The authors of this paper introduce Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT) as a novel approach to address this imbalance. PBT uses multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create a balanced dataset comprising both positive and negative persuasion examples and trains models to navigate this complexity, improving both resistance to negative influences and receptiveness to positive ones. This section stresses the shortcomings of focusing solely on resistance to negative persuasion, as it can lead to models that are overly rigid and resistant to correction, negatively impacting their overall performance and adaptability.  The goal is to create models that can both hold their ground against manipulation and adjust their responses based on constructive feedback, a crucial step towards making LLMs safer and more effective conversational partners.", "first_cons": "The section's focus on negative persuasion is a bit narrow, neglecting other critical aspects of LLM behavior that can significantly impact the persuadability of models.", "first_pros": "The section effectively summarizes and contextualizes prior research in LLMs related to persuasion, highlighting its limitations and paving the way for the paper's proposed solution.", "keypoints": ["Existing work heavily focuses on negative persuasion in LLMs, such as susceptibility to misinformation and flip-flopping.", "Studies show adversarial users can manipulate LLMs to reveal private data or generate harmful text.", "The importance of incorporating positive persuasion in LLMs is emphasized, moving toward balanced interaction.", "Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT) is introduced as a new method to balance positive and negative persuasion.", "PBT utilizes multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create a balanced dataset, improving both resistance to negative persuasion and receptiveness to positive ones."], "second_cons": "The discussion of related work could benefit from a more in-depth exploration of specific techniques used in prior studies on persuasion, potentially enriching the comparative analysis.", "second_pros": "The connection between the current work and related fields such as knowledge updating and conflict resolution is well-established, providing a broader context for the study.", "summary": "This section of the paper reviews existing research on persuasion in large language models (LLMs).

Preference data is then created by comparing the scores of these counterfactual responses.  Finally, the models are trained using preference optimization, balancing the acceptance of positive and negative persuasion.

For Llama-3.1-70B, resist-only training achieves a 45.69% absolute reduction, while PBT achieves a 38.13% reduction. Accept-only training, however, worsens the performance.\n\n- **Resisting Flip-flopping:** PBT eliminates flip-flopping, a phenomenon where models change their answers when challenged, unlike the base model (a 33% decrease) and the resist-only model (a 0.4% decrease). Accept-only training shows a 9.5% accuracy decrease. \n\n- **Balancing Positive and Negative Persuasion:** PBT achieves the highest accuracy (63.88% on average across models) in a balanced dataset containing both positive and negative persuasion examples, significantly outperforming resist-only and accept-only models which demonstrate overcorrection, highlighting PBT's ability to effectively handle both types of persuasion.  Resist-only training leads to poor performance on positive examples, while accept-only struggles with negative ones.  \n\n- **Building Effective LLM Teams:**  PBT addresses the order dependency problem in multi-agent debates.  When pairing strong and weak models, the team's performance without PBT heavily depends on which model goes first, with accuracy dropping by 8.7% in the worst case. PBT mitigates this order dependency, resulting in more stable and better overall performance (74.2% average accuracy).

Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT), which balances both resisting negative and accepting positive persuasion, consistently outperforms models trained only to resist or accept persuasion across various metrics, including resistance to misinformation, prevention of flip-flopping, balanced persuasion handling, and team performance in multi-agent debates. PBT addresses the issue of order dependency in team settings, making team performance more stable and better.  Resist-only and accept-only training lead to over-correction, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach to handling persuasion in LLMs.  The results demonstrate PBT's effectiveness in creating more robust and reliable LLMs that can effectively interact in diverse conversational scenarios.  Specific numerical improvements are reported across various metrics for different LLMs and tasks showcasing PBT's superiority over other training methods.  These results highlight the importance of balancing acceptance and resistance in training LLMs for improved conversational abilities and robustness against manipulation. The study utilizes various benchmarks and metrics to comprehensively evaluate the performance of different approaches in handling persuasion and teamwork between LLM models. Overall, the results strongly advocate for the use of PBT in training LLMs for improved robustness and performance across various scenarios and teamwork configurations.
