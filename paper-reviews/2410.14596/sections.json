This susceptibility presents significant risks, as adversarial actors can manipulate LLMs into revealing private information or generating harmful content. However, the authors argue that simply making LLMs resistant to *negative* persuasion (e.g., misinformation) is insufficient.  They contend that LLMs must also be capable of accepting *beneficial* persuasion to improve their responses and facilitate productive interactions. This necessitates a balanced approach, not just resistance to manipulation.\n\nThe authors highlight the limitations of current research.  Most studies focus solely on negative persuasion, analyzing how easily LLMs can be manipulated into providing incorrect, harmful, or inappropriate information.  While this is crucial, the authors demonstrate the problem of overcorrection. If trained only to resist persuasion, LLMs lose the ability to improve and may become frustrating and unproductive conversation partners.  Thus, the need for a more nuanced perspective that considers both positive and negative aspects of persuasion in LLM training and development is emphasized.\n\nThe introduction sets the stage for the proposed solution, Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT).  PBT will leverage multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create training data which encapsulates both positive and negative persuasive scenarios. The goal is to train models to accept persuasion when appropriate and to resist harmful or misleading persuasion, achieving a robust balance between acceptance and resistance.", "first_cons": "The introduction might be too brief for readers to thoroughly grasp the complexities and nuances of the problem before the proposed solution is mentioned.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly highlights the limitations of current research and the need for a more balanced approach to training LLMs.", "keypoints": ["LLMs are susceptible to both positive and negative persuasion.", "Existing research primarily focuses on resisting negative persuasion, neglecting the importance of accepting beneficial persuasion.", "Over-reliance on resisting persuasion can lead to poor performance and hinder productive interactions.", "Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT) is proposed as a solution to achieve a robust balance between accepting and resisting persuasion."], "second_cons": "The introduction could benefit from providing a few specific examples of how LLMs can be manipulated in both positive and negative ways to further emphasize the scope of the problem.", "second_pros": "The introduction effectively sets the stage for the rest of the paper by clearly defining the problem, highlighting the limitations of existing approaches, and introducing the proposed solution.", "summary": "The introduction highlights the vulnerability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to both positive and negative persuasion.

Qualitative examples are provided to showcase how the proposed Persuasion Balanced Training (PBT) method enables models to correctly accept beneficial changes and resist misinformation, unlike models trained only to resist or accept information.\n\nThe analysis reveals the importance of considering both aspects \u2013 resisting negative and accepting positive persuasion \u2013 for improved model performance.  Over-reliance on either approach leads to suboptimal results.  The discussion explores the parallels between model behavior and human interactions, highlighting the influence of initial information ('anchoring bias') and the potential for future work to address conversational strategies to improve team performance.\n\nFinally, limitations of the study are addressed: the reliance on closed-form answers restricts the analysis to specific question-answering tasks and limits generalizability to other dialogue types and languages. The question of whether LLMs possess beliefs is also considered, clarifying that the focus remains on observable belief expressions (model outputs) rather than internal belief states.", "first_cons": "The study's reliance on closed-form answers limits its applicability to more complex conversational scenarios and other languages.", "first_pros": "The study achieves high accuracy (96.36%) in predicting whether a model will change its answer based on a relatively small number of key features.", "keypoints": ["A logistic regression model accurately (96.36%) predicts answer changes based on probabilities of the original and alternative answers.", "The model's decision to flip an answer is primarily driven by the plausibility of the answers, not confidence scores.", "Over-reliance on either resisting or accepting persuasion leads to suboptimal performance; a balance is crucial.", "The analysis highlights the parallel between LLM behavior and human conversational dynamics, suggesting future work could explore conversational strategies for improved team performance."], "second_cons": "The study acknowledges the unresolved issue of LLMs having internal beliefs, making it challenging to definitively state if a model truly changes its beliefs versus just expressing agreement with an interlocutor.", "second_pros": "The study offers valuable insights into the factors behind model decisions to accept or reject new information, and provides qualitative examples highlighting the benefits of the PBT method.", "summary": "This section analyzes how large language models decide whether to change their answers based on persuasive arguments.  A logistic regression model accurately predicts answer changes (96.36% accuracy) primarily based on the likelihood of the original versus alternative answers rather than confidence scores. The analysis emphasizes the importance of balancing resistance to misinformation with acceptance of beneficial information for optimal performance and points out that the model's behavior reflects human conversational dynamics. Limitations include reliance on specific question-answering tasks and ambiguity concerning the nature of LLM 'beliefs'.

The method's scalability, however, is acknowledged as a positive aspect.  Another limitation highlighted is the focus on specific domains and languages (like English) for which suitable data is readily available. This limits the generalizability of the findings. The authors also touch upon the unresolved debate about LLMs having beliefs, avoiding claims about LLMs' internal belief states and focusing solely on observable beliefs expressed in outputs.  Finally, a cautionary note is raised regarding the potential risks of making models resistant to persuasion, which might inadvertently reduce their controllability, making them more stubborn.", "first_cons": "The use of closed-form answers to assess persuasion oversimplifies the complexity of real-world LLM interactions, potentially overlooking nuances and subtleties in the persuasiveness process.", "first_pros": "The methodology is scalable and allows for efficient generation and evaluation of large datasets for testing persuasion models in LLMs.", "keypoints": ["Closed-form answers used to assess persuasion may oversimplify complex interactions and miss subtle aspects.", "The research is limited to domains and languages with readily available data, affecting generalizability.", "The question of LLMs having beliefs remains unresolved; findings focus on observable expressions of beliefs instead.", "Making models resistant to persuasion could hinder their controllability."], "second_cons": "The study is restricted to specific domains and languages (e.g., English trivia) where suitable data exists; results may not generalize to all situations.", "second_pros": "The authors acknowledge and address concerns around interpreting LLM behavior and beliefs, focusing on observable outputs instead of inferring internal states.", "summary": "The limitations section primarily focuses on the methodological challenges of assessing persuasion in LLMs, highlighting the oversimplification of using closed-form answers, the limited scope of data used (English-language trivia), and the unresolved issue of attributing beliefs to LLMs. The authors also caution about potential controllability issues resulting from making models resistant to persuasion."}}]
