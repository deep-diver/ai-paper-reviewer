It argues that LLMs shouldn't just resist negative persuasion (like misinformation), but should also be able to accept positive persuasion (like helpful corrections).  The researchers introduce \"Persuasion-Balanced Training\" (PBT), a new method that uses multi-agent dialogues to create training data where LLMs debate each other. PBT trains the models to distinguish between good and bad persuasion using a preference-based reinforcement learning approach.  Experiments show that PBT improves the models' ability to resist misinformation and flip-flopping (changing answers due to minor challenges) while simultaneously improving their capacity to accept helpful advice. Importantly, PBT also makes LLM teams more stable, resolving inconsistencies caused by the order of responses from stronger and weaker LLMs in collaborative settings.  This research is significant because it shows that teaching LLMs to critically evaluate and respond to persuasion, instead of simply resisting all persuasion, is crucial for creating reliable and helpful AI systems."}
