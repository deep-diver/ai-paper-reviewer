Current methods often use problem-level examples, which can lead to irrelevant guidance during the step-wise solution process. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that LLMs can correctly identify what steps are needed but may fail to execute the steps accurately.\nBoostStep tackles this by introducing step-level in-context learning and a 'first-try' strategy. This approach aligns the granularity between example retrieval and reasoning, providing highly relevant examples for each step.  BoostStep demonstrates significant performance improvements on various mathematical benchmarks, especially those with lower similarity to the training data. Importantly, it's also shown to integrate well with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) methods, enhancing both candidate generation and decision-making.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.03226/podcast.wav"}
