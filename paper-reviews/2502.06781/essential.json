Existing methods often rely on complex techniques and abundant data, hindering the development of efficient and robust reasoning models.  The sparse nature of binary feedback in mathematical problems poses a significant challenge for reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Prior research has used different approaches such as distillation, however, those methods have limitations in scalability and fundamental reasoning capability. This paper introduces OREAL, a new RL framework designed to overcome these limitations. \nOREAL uses a theoretically sound approach, leveraging the properties of best-of-N sampling to learn from positive examples and incorporating reward shaping to handle negative samples effectively.  A token-level reward model further enhances learning by focusing on important steps in the reasoning process.  Experiments show OREAL achieves state-of-the-art results on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, surpassing previous models in terms of accuracy and efficiency. **The findings demonstrate the potential of OREAL to push the boundaries of mathematical reasoning capabilities in LLMs and its applicability to other similar tasks involving sparse rewards.**", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06781/podcast.wav"}
