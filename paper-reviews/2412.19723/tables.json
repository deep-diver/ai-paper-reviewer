For each benchmark, the table shows the success rate (SR), indicating the percentage of tasks successfully completed, and the action type accuracy (Type). The action type accuracy measures how well the model's predicted actions (e.g., CLICK, SCROLL, TYPE) match the ground truth actions needed to complete the tasks.  The models compared include various Vision-Language Models (VLMs) trained using different methods such as zero-shot, task-driven, task-driven with self-instruction, and OS-Genesis.
