State space models (SSMs) offer an alternative with constant complexity, but they struggle with memory recall.  Existing hybrid models combining transformers and SSMs suffer from performance bottlenecks when one architecture type is less suitable for specific tasks.\nThis paper introduces Hymba, a new family of small language models that uses a hybrid-head architecture. This architecture combines transformer attention heads and SSM heads in parallel within the same layer.  This allows Hymba to leverage both high-resolution recall of attention heads and the efficient context summarization of SSM heads.  Hymba also uses learnable meta tokens that are prepended to input sequences to further enhance performance. Experimental results show that Hymba achieves state-of-the-art results, outperforming existing sub-2B public models and even surpassing Llama-3.2-3B in terms of accuracy, cache size, and throughput.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.13676/podcast.wav"}
