This limitation hinders effective application in areas like robotics and augmented reality, where understanding 3D environments is crucial.  Existing attempts to improve these models by adding 3D information have faced limitations due to the considerable gap between the model's learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes.\nThe proposed Video-3D LLM addresses this by representing 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding. This approach accurately aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts.  A maximum coverage sampling technique is also implemented to optimize the balance between computational costs and performance.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that Video-3D LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.00493/podcast.wav"}
