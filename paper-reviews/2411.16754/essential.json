Existing techniques struggle with sophisticated models, leading to concerns about misinformation and malicious use.  This research underscores the critical need for advanced detection methods and a more comprehensive evaluation framework. \nThe paper introduces the Visual Counter Turing Test (VCT\u00b2) benchmark, using ~130,000 images from various AI models.  It also proposes the Visual AI Index (VAI), a new metric evaluating generated images' visual quality across seven key aspects.  Results reveal significant shortcomings in existing detectors, demonstrating the urgency for improved methods and highlighting the value of VAI in evaluating generative AI models.", "affiliation": "University of South Carolina", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.16754/podcast.wav"}
