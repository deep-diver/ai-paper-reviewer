Existing methods struggle with representing complex geometries and fine details efficiently, often sacrificing quality for computational feasibility. This results in limitations in generating detailed and diverse 3D shapes, a crucial need for many applications. This paper introduces Wavelet Latent Diffusion (WaLa), a novel approach that addresses these limitations by using wavelet-based, compact latent encodings of 3D shapes. This method efficiently trains a large-scale generative model, achieving a remarkable compression ratio without significant loss of detail.  \nWaLa, with its approximately one billion parameters, generates high-quality 3D shapes at 2563 resolution.  The model's performance surpasses state-of-the-art results across diverse datasets and input modalities, including text, images, sketches, point clouds, and more.  Furthermore, WaLa's fast inference times (2-4 seconds) make it highly practical for various applications.  The model\u2019s impressive performance, along with the open-sourced code and pre-trained models, makes it a significant contribution to the field of 3D generative modeling.", "affiliation": "Autodesk", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2411.08017/podcast.wav"}
