The comparison is done across two benchmark datasets (gsm8k and MATH), showing both accuracy percentages and average inference time (in seconds).  This allows for an evaluation of the trade-off between improved accuracy and increased processing time resulting from the optimization technique.", "section": "3.2 Results"}]
