Existing speculative decoding techniques, effective for text models, hadn't been successfully applied to continuous-valued image generation models.  This limitation stems from the difficulty in handling continuous probability distributions and adapting the acceptance criteria. \nThis research introduces Continuous Speculative Decoding, extending speculative decoding to the continuous space of autoregressive image generation.  This involves developing a tailored acceptance criterion for diffusion distributions, employing trajectory alignment to ensure consistent outputs, and using a novel sampling method to address resampling challenges. The results demonstrate a significant speedup (up to 2.33x) with maintained image quality.", "affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.11925/podcast.wav"}
