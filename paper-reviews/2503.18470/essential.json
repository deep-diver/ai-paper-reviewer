Supervised fine-tuning(SFT) is limited as there is no single correct layout and existing methods often require extensive post-processing to ensure physical plausibility, coherence and structural consistency. Therefore, there is a need to enhance VLM with 3D spatial reasoning for real-time 3D scene generation, eliminating hard-coded optimization.\n\nTo address these issues, MetaSpatial, a reinforcement learning(RL) framework, enhances 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs. This approach involves a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism integrating physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations. It introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, enabling VLMs to refine spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent.", "affiliation": "Northwestern University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18470/podcast.wav"}
