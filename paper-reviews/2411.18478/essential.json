{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses limitations of traditional in-context learning (ICL) in complex reasoning tasks. By introducing HiAR-ICL, a novel automated reasoning paradigm, it offers a solution to improve ICL's generalization ability and reduce dependence on human expertise in demonstration creation.  This opens new avenues for improving LLMs' reasoning capabilities, particularly in domains requiring advanced cognitive skills. **The findings have significant implications for the field and researchers working on improving LLMs' performance in complex reasoning tasks, making this a timely and relevant piece of research.**", "summary": "HiAR-ICL, a novel automated reasoning paradigm using Monte Carlo Tree Search, surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy in complex mathematical reasoning by shifting focus from specific examples to abstract thinking patterns in in-context learning.", "takeaways": ["HiAR-ICL surpasses state-of-the-art accuracy on complex mathematical reasoning benchmarks.", "The method uses a novel automated reasoning paradigm that shifts focus from specific examples to higher-level cognitive reasoning patterns.", "HiAR-ICL reduces the reliance on human expertise in creating high-quality demonstrations and enhances LLMs' generalization ability."], "tldr": "Traditional in-context learning (ICL) for large language models (LLMs) struggles with complex reasoning tasks due to its heavy reliance on high-quality example demonstrations and human intervention.  This dependence limits its generalization ability and efficiency.  Furthermore, creating these demonstrations often requires substantial human expertise, making it a time-consuming and labor-intensive process.\nThis paper introduces HiAR-ICL, a novel high-level automated reasoning paradigm.  **HiAR-ICL utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to explore reasoning paths and construct \"thought cards,\" representing abstract thinking patterns.**  These cards guide the reasoning process, reducing the need for specific examples and human intervention.  **The results show that HiAR-ICL significantly outperforms existing methods in complex mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy and demonstrating improved efficiency.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.18478/podcast.wav"}
