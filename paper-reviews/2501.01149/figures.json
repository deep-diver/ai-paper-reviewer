The controller interacts directly with the Android device, managing actions such as screen captures, XML data retrieval, and sending commands. The translator mediates between the agent and the device, converting agent actions into device-compatible commands and vice-versa. The evaluator assesses the agent's performance by comparing the final state of the device to the task's expected outcome, providing a quantitative measure of success. This modular design allows for flexibility and easy integration with different agents and evaluation methods.", "section": "3 Android Agent Arena (A3)"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.01149/extracted/6106815/images/dist_category.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Distribution of tasks in A3.
