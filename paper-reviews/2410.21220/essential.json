This is especially challenging when new objects and concepts frequently emerge and updating models is computationally expensive.  The problem is that VLMs lack real-time access to updated information.\n\nTo address this, the researchers introduce Vision Search Assistant (VSA). VSA combines the strengths of VLMs and web agents. VLMs provide visual understanding and web agents offer real-time information access. This collaborative approach allows the system to answer questions about unseen images by searching and retrieving relevant information from the web. Experiments showed that VSA significantly outperforms other models in handling both open and closed-set question answering tasks.  This approach enhances VLM's ability to handle novel visual content and makes them more adaptable to the constantly evolving real-world information."}
