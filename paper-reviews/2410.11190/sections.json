It emphasizes GPT-40's capabilities in multi-modal question answering, its ability to handle diverse input/output modalities beyond text, and its flexible, interruption-based interaction. However, GPT-40's closed-source nature poses a challenge for researchers. Existing open-source models often only partially replicate GPT-40's functionalities, typically using pre-trained encoders and cascading techniques to approximate its multi-modal capabilities rather than a fully unified approach.  The section identifies the major challenges involved in achieving true GPT-40-level capabilities, such as the complexity of building a unified multi-modal model that effectively handles text, vision, and speech; the need for substantial data integration across modalities (significantly more than previously used); and the design of an equally sophisticated interaction mechanism. The authors emphasize that the task of creating a unified multi-modal model that exhibits GPT-40's direct inference capabilities in various contexts presents significant hurdles.

Large Vision Language Models have rapidly advanced, starting with CLIP in 2021 and progressing to models like BLIP, BLIP-2, Llava, Qwen-VL, Qwen2-VL, InstructBLIP, MiniGPT-4, GPT-4V, and Gemini.  These models typically integrate a vision encoder, an adapter layer, and a large language model.  The section notes that research also explores higher-resolution vision encoders and Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) architectures.  In Audio Language Modeling, the focus is on representing speech as tokens, similar to text, enabling understanding and reasoning.  Key models mentioned include VALL-E, MusicGen, AudioPaLM, and LauraGPT, along with speech-to-speech interaction models like Mini-Omni, Llama-Omni, and Moshi.  The use of speech tokenization methods, such as SpeechTokenizer, Google USM, and EnCodec, is also highlighted. Finally, the section discusses Multi-modal Interaction Models, noting that researchers have begun to create end-to-end models for voice chat, such as Spectron, SpeechGPT, Mini-Omni, Llama-Omni, Moshi, and VITA.
