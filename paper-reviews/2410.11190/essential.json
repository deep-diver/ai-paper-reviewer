It excels at understanding and responding to visual, audio, and text inputs, and can even engage in real-time, two-way conversations. The researchers achieved this by integrating pre-trained visual and audio encoders with a language model, training it in three stages.  Stage one focuses on adapting the encoders; stage two aligns the different modalities; and stage three refines the model's ability to handle multi-modal output and interruptions.  The model uses a novel command-based interruption mechanism allowing for more natural conversations.  This is a significant step towards open-source multi-modal models, offering valuable insight into training methods and capabilities for the field.  The team hopes the model will spur further research and development in open multi-modal AI."}
