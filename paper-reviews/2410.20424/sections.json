A **multi-agent system** comprising five specialized agents (Reader, Planner, Developer, Reviewer, and Summarizer) collaborates to execute these phases.  The framework emphasizes **code quality**, incorporating iterative debugging and unit testing, and utilizes a **comprehensive machine learning tools library** to enhance productivity.  AutoKaggle generates detailed reports at each phase and on competition conclusion, enhancing transparency and user trust. The iterative debugging approach ensures code correctness through code execution, debugging, and unit testing.  The machine learning library boosts code generation efficiency and quality by handling complex tasks with pre-built, expert-validated code snippets.
