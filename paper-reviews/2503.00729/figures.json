Environmental data is received by the Observer (VLM), which then sends it to the Summarizer (LLM). This module creates a memory representation that is used by the Planner (LLM) to create an initial sequence of actions based on the robot's skill set and memory.  The Critic (VLM) examines the actions' feasibility and proposes alternative plans as necessary in response to changing conditions in the environment.  This closed-loop system enables continuous adaptation to real-time situations.", "section": "IV.

Unlike traditional failure-detection classification systems, CLEA performs internal reasoning upon receiving visual input and provides structured outputs. In the case where no medication is found in an empty drawer, the planner does not halt its intent. Instead, the critic suggests exploring alternative locations and provides the correct advice to check other compartments of the drawer, thereby guiding the successful completion of the task.", "description": "Figure 3 illustrates CLEA's closed-loop reasoning process. Unlike traditional systems that simply halt upon detecting a failure (like not finding medication), CLEA performs internal reasoning. When the robot doesn't find medication in the drawer, the critic module analyzes the situation.  Instead of stopping, the critic suggests alternative actions, such as checking other compartments, enabling the robot to adapt and continue toward task completion.", "section": "IV.

The three agents are: CLEA (the proposed closed-loop embodied agent), CLEA w/o critic (an ablation study removing the critic module from CLEA), and a baseline open-loop agent.  The bar charts visually compare the Success Rates (SR) and Average Scores (AS) achieved by each agent on each task type.  This allows for a direct comparison of the effectiveness of the closed-loop approach (CLEA) compared to the open-loop baseline and the importance of the critic module within the CLEA architecture.", "section": "V.
