Pass@1 indicates the overall pass rate.

The \"Pass@1\" metric shows the percentage of times the model successfully generated correct code on its first attempt.  The \"ASPR\" (Average Sampling Pass Rate) metric is more nuanced; it indicates the average success rate of the model in arriving at the correct reasoning path when generating code.  A higher ASPR value suggests a more effective reasoning process, even if the final code might not be correct.  The models used include several variants of the Qwen model family.", "section": "3.2 REASONING-ENHANCED CODE DATA SYNTHESIS"}]
