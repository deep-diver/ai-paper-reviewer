OpenAI's o1 model demonstrated significant advancements in this area, spurring multiple replication attempts. However, replicating and improving upon the o1 model for specialized tasks like code generation presents significant challenges, particularly concerning code evaluation and defining appropriate reward functions for the reasoning process. \nThis paper introduces O1-CODER, a system designed to replicate the o1 model specifically for coding. It employs a unique approach, combining reinforcement learning with Monte Carlo Tree Search. This framework includes a Test Case Generator for automated code testing and iterative fine-tuning of the model to generate pseudocode initially, followed by the complete code.  The result is a system that demonstrates improved System-2 thinking capabilities for generating code, which is evaluated based on both the quality of the reasoning steps and the correctness of the final code.", "affiliation": "Beijing Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.00154/podcast.wav"}
