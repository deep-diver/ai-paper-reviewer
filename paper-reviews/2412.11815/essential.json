{"importance": "**This paper introduces a novel framework, ColorFlow,  and benchmark for sequence image colorization, a critical area lacking dedicated research.  By focusing on identity consistency across frames and using a reference-based approach**, the research addresses limitations of existing colorization methods. **The benchmark and open-sourced code provide valuable resources for researchers**, enabling further exploration and advancement in this field. **This work bridges a gap between academic research and industry needs** by offering a solution directly applicable to cartoon and comic colorization, potentially influencing art production workflows.

While general image colorization using AI has seen progress, preserving the identity (e.g., consistent hair and clothing color) of characters across a sequence remains a hurdle. Current AI solutions aren't robust enough for industry use because they're hard to control and don't guarantee color consistency, making them unsuitable for professional animation or comic production.  This gap between current methods and industry requirements motivates the need for new, more controllable approaches.\nThis paper introduces ColorFlow, a new AI model specifically designed to colorize image sequences while maintaining character and object identity across frames.  It leverages a reference image pool to match colors, ensuring consistent hair color, clothing, and other attributes.  A key feature is a three-stage process: retrieving relevant color references, colorizing using context from references, and enhancing resolution. ColorFlow was tested on a new dataset, ColorFlow-Bench, comprising manga chapters with corresponding reference images, and demonstrated significant improvement over existing models in both visual quality and color consistency.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.11815/podcast.wav"}
