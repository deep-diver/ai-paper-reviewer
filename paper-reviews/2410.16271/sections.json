It begins by highlighting the core challenge of NeRF: the need for significant computational resources and time, often relying on external datasets for pre-training, especially in few-shot scenarios.  Traditional NeRF methods use frequency regularization via multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) and positional encoding, but this leads to slow convergence. Alternatives such as voxel upsampling or pre-trained models struggle with generalization to various scenes and may introduce biases from their training datasets.  The paper then dives into existing approaches that address the limitations of traditional NeRFs in few-shot settings.  These approaches include using depth regularization, for example, by leveraging sparse depth estimated by an SfM model (DS-NeRF [21]) or pre-trained depth priors from sparse depth (DDP-NeRF [61]). SparseNeRF [81] uses a dense prediction transformer for dense depth priors.  Other methods use frequency regularization (FreeNeRF [91]), voxel upsampling (VGOS [75]), or pre-trained models (various methods shown in Figure 2).  The section points out that those methods either suffer from slow convergence, struggle with complex scheduling, introduce biases from pre-trained models, or rely on additional resources such as RGB-D data and pre-trained feature extractors.  Finally, this section briefly mentions methods for novel pose regularization, emphasizing the challenges associated with limited overlapping in sparse inputs and the common issue of floaters in synthesized novel views.", "first_cons": "The section's overview of existing methods is quite broad and doesn't delve into the specific strengths and weaknesses of each approach in sufficient detail.
