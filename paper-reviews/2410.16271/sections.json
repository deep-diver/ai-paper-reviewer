It begins by defining the problem: generating new views from limited input images, a task crucial for many computer vision applications. Traditional Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) are acknowledged as a powerful approach for high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction, but their high computational demands and long training times are identified as major hurdles, especially in scenarios with limited data. The reliance of many existing NeRF methods on pre-training with external datasets is also criticized for creating dependencies and potential bias.

It highlights the challenges faced by previous approaches, such as overfitting and long training times, especially when dealing with limited input data.  The authors discuss various techniques employed by prior works to address these challenges, including frequency regularization, voxel upsampling, and the use of pre-trained models.  Frequency regularization methods aim to control the high-frequency components to improve generalization, but often lead to slow convergence.
