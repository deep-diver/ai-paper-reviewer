Traditional methods are slow and often need extra data for training. FrugalNeRF cleverly uses weight-sharing voxels at different scales to efficiently represent the scene.  A key innovation is its cross-scale geometric adaptation, which uses reprojection errors to guide training without pre-trained models, ensuring the model learns well from the available data. Experiments show that FrugalNeRF creates high-quality images much faster than existing methods, proving its effectiveness across different types of scenes."}
