This paper introduces FrugalNeRF, a novel method that achieves comparable or better results with significantly less data and training time.  It cleverly uses weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales, capturing various frequency components efficiently.  A key innovation is the cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme, which uses reprojection errors to guide training without needing external priors.  This makes FrugalNeRF both fast and robust, outperforming existing few-shot NeRF approaches on several standard datasets.  The researchers suggest further study in handling scenarios with significant viewpoint changes or extremely limited training views."}
