Traditional methods struggle with slow training and overfitting. FrugalNeRF cleverly uses weight-sharing voxels at multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details.  A key innovation is its cross-scale geometric adaptation: it identifies the most accurate depth from different scales using reprojection errors, effectively creating pseudo ground truth without external data. This approach speeds up training and improves accuracy, outperforming other methods.  Experiments show FrugalNeRF is dramatically faster and produces better results on standard datasets."}
