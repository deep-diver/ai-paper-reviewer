Existing acceleration methods primarily focus on reducing sampling steps, failing to address the inherent memory constraints. This paper presents MobileVD, the first mobile-optimized video diffusion model. \nMobileVD addresses these issues by employing several optimizations.  These include reducing frame resolution, introducing multi-scale temporal representations, and implementing novel pruning schemas to reduce channel and temporal block counts.  Adversarial finetuning further accelerates the process by reducing denoising to a single step. The result is a model that is significantly more efficient while maintaining reasonable visual quality, achieving a 523x efficiency gain compared to SVD on a mobile device.", "affiliation": "Qualcomm AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.07583/podcast.wav"}
