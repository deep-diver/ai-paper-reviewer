Vision-focused models, while good at processing visual data, struggle with language, thus limiting its task flexibility. There is a need to improve existing models by enhancing general-purpose visual features and maintaining language strengths. \n\nThis paper presents **TULIP**, a drop-in replacement for existing CLIP-like models, uses generative data augmentation, enhanced image-image and text-text contrastive learning, and reconstruction regularization to learn fine-grained visual features while preserving global semantic alignment. TULIP outperforms existing models, setting a new zero-shot performance record on ImageNet-1K and significantly improving performance on several vision-language benchmarks.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15485/podcast.wav"}
