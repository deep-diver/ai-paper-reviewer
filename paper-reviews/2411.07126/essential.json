Existing pixel-space generators suffer from artifact accumulation during upsampling. This paper addresses these limitations by proposing a new approach.\nThe proposed method uses a **cascaded pixel-space diffusion model** with a novel **Laplacian diffusion process**. This process attenuates image signals at different frequencies at varying rates, significantly improving the precision and efficiency of the generation process. The model demonstrates strong performance across various tasks including text-to-image synthesis, 4K upsampling, ControlNets, and 360\u00b0 HDR panorama generation.  Furthermore, a **finetuning method** allows for easy customization.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.07126/podcast.wav"}
