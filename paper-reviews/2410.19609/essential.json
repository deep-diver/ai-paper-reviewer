Multimodal agents, while promising, often lack ground-truth feedback during real-world exploration.\nThis work introduces OpenWebVoyager, an open-source framework that addresses these limitations.  It leverages an iterative process: initial imitation learning from a strong base model, followed by cycles of real-world exploration, GPT-40 feedback for trajectory evaluation, and policy optimization.  Results demonstrate substantial performance improvements, showcasing the effectiveness of iterative learning with real-world feedback for building robust multimodal web agents."}
