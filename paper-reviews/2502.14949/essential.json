Current Arabic OCR datasets lack comprehensive coverage and advanced document processing challenges such as table parsing, font detection, and numeral recognition. There is a need for a comprehensive framework to evaluate and compare Arabic OCR solutions by offering diverse document types and evaluation tasks to facilitate in-depth assessments of modern OCR systems.\n\nThis paper introduces **KITAB-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark** spanning 9 domains and 36 sub-domains. The framework evaluates layout detection, multi-format recognition, and structured output generation. It facilitates in-depth assessments of modern OCR systems. The contributions include a comprehensive Arabic OCR benchmark covering multiple document types and recognition tasks, detailed evaluation metrics, baseline results for OCR systems and VLMs, and a standardized framework for comparing Arabic OCR systems.", "affiliation": "MBZUAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Scene Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14949/podcast.wav"}
