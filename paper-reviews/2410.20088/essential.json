{"importance": "**This paper is crucial** because it bridges the gap between in-context learning (successful in LLMs) and retriever models.  By showing how to effectively use in-context examples in retrieval, it advances a widely-used technique and opens new avenues for improving retrieval systems' performance and generalization.", "summary": "RARE enhances retrieval model accuracy by effectively integrating in-context examples, achieving up to +2.72% nDCG improvement.", "takeaways": ["Incorporating in-context examples into retriever models significantly improves performance.", "The proposed method, RARE, is effective across various architectures.", "RARE shows stronger out-of-domain generalization compared to traditional methods."], "tldr": "Current retrieval methods struggle to leverage in-context examples effectively, limiting performance.  Naively adding examples often hurts performance.  This is a significant limitation because in-context learning dramatically improves performance in other large language models.\n\nThe paper introduces RARE, a method to use in-context examples successfully. RARE fine-tunes a pre-trained model with semantically similar queries and their associated documents as examples. This approach consistently improves results on various benchmarks, even demonstrating strong out-of-domain generalization. The work highlights the importance of careful design choices in how in-context examples are used and lays a foundation for further research in this space.
