Current methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) often suffer from computational inefficiencies and training instability.  This limits their applicability, especially when dealing with large models and limited resources.\nThis paper introduces Feature-level constrained Preference Optimization (FPO), a novel method designed to address these issues. FPO uses pre-trained sparse autoencoders to create sparse feature representations.  By imposing constraints at the feature level, FPO achieves efficient and stable alignment. Experiments show that FPO outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 5% in win rate while significantly reducing computational cost, making it a promising solution for efficient and controllable LLM alignment.", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.07618/podcast.wav"}
