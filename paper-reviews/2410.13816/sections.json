While large datasets collected from diverse sources have recently made large-scale robotic learning feasible, these data sources are typically of mixed quality, and recovering high-performing and fluent policies from such suboptimal data is difficult. State-of-the-art imitation learning methods can effectively replicate the distribution of demonstrations, but the mixed quality of these datasets makes this distribution fall short of the performance desired from robotic systems. Generalist policies often fail due to imprecise manipulation, such as failed grasping or early dropping, despite their strong semantic generalization. These issues become more severe when the policy encounters environmental distribution shifts, even if these shifts are extraneous in nature (e.g., changes in table texture, camera pose, and distractors). Fine-tuning the policy is infeasible in the non-stationary real world, as each adaptation cycle would require costly human tele-operated or instrumented data collection, as well as unintuitive hyperparameter tuning to prevent the model from losing its generalist capabilities. Re-ranking multiple action proposals from a generalist policy using a value function at test-time allows for the improvement of precision and robustness of the policy upon deployment without fine-tuning or data collection.", "first_cons": "Fine-tuning generalist policies is infeasible in non-stationary real-world scenarios due to the high cost of data collection and hyperparameter tuning.", "first_pros": "Re-ranking actions using a value function at test time is an effective way to improve the precision and robustness of generalist robotic policies without requiring retraining or access to the policy's weights.", "keypoints": ["Large datasets are crucial for effective robotic learning but are usually of mixed quality.", "Generalist policies often fail due to imprecise manipulation, especially with environmental shifts.", "Fine-tuning is infeasible in the real world due to the high cost of data collection and the risk of losing generalist capabilities.", "Re-ranking actions with value functions at deployment time offers a viable alternative to fine-tuning."], "second_cons": "The mixed quality of large datasets makes it challenging to train high-performing and fluent robotic policies.", "second_pros": "The proposed approach of re-ranking actions using a value function at test time preserves the generalist capabilities of the policy while significantly improving its precision and robustness.", "summary": "Modern machine learning relies on large, high-capacity models trained on diverse datasets.

It begins by establishing the context of controlling a robot using language instructions, representing this interaction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The MDP framework, denoted as *M = (S, A, P, r, \u03b3)*,  includes state space *S*, action space *A*, transition probabilities *P*, reward function *r*, and discount factor *\u03b3*.  Crucially, it emphasizes that the approach works with \"generalist, language-conditioned robotic policies\" which are treated as black boxes; their internal weights are not accessed or modified.  The section then introduces the concept of a language-annotated robot dataset, *D = {(\u03c4\u2081, l\u2081), (\u03c4\u2082, l\u2082),...,(\u03c4\u2099, l\u2099)}*, where each trajectory *\u03c4\u1d62* contains a sequence of states and actions and *l\u1d62* is the corresponding language instruction.

First, it pre-trains a language-conditioned value function, Qe(s, a, l), using offline reinforcement learning (specifically Cal-QL or IQL) on a diverse dataset of robotic demonstrations. This function learns to estimate the long-term value of taking action 'a' in state 's' given language instruction 'l'.  Crucially, this training is done *offline* and doesn't require access to the weights or internal workings of the generalist policies it will later be used with. In the second stage, during deployment, V-GPS samples multiple action proposals from a generalist policy (any policy, it's a plug-and-play system). It then re-ranks these actions according to their Q-values, using a softmax function with a tunable temperature parameter (\u03b2) to control the balance between exploration (higher \u03b2) and exploitation (lower \u03b2). Finally, the highest-ranking action is executed by the robot.  This re-ranking process is done at *test-time*, allowing the value function to guide the generalist policy without the need for retraining or any modification of the policy itself.
