While large datasets are now feasible, their mixed quality makes it difficult to train high-performing and fluent robotic policies.  State-of-the-art imitation learning effectively replicates the distribution of demonstrations, but this distribution often falls short of desired performance due to imprecise manipulation (e.g., failed grasping).  These issues worsen when the policy faces environmental distribution shifts.  Fine-tuning policies is infeasible in non-stationary real-world settings due to the costs involved in data collection and the risk of losing generalist capabilities. The paper proposes an approach to enhance the precision and robustness of these generalist robotic policies without fine-tuning or modifying the policy itself.  The core idea is to 'steer' an off-the-shelf generalist policy at deployment time by re-ranking multiple action proposals based on a value function learned offline via reinforcement learning. This allows preservation of the generalist capabilities while improving precision and robustness without requiring extensive, costly, and specialized training procedures.", "first_cons": "Fine-tuning generalist policies is infeasible in real-world scenarios due to high data collection costs and the risk of losing generalization capabilities.", "first_pros": "The proposed approach enhances the performance of generalist robot policies at deployment time without fine-tuning or accessing the policy weights.", "keypoints": ["Large datasets are now feasible for robotic learning, but their mixed quality is a significant challenge.", "Generalist policies often fail due to imprecise manipulation and are sensitive to environmental distribution shifts.", "Fine-tuning policies is infeasible in the real world; it is too costly and risky.", "The proposed method improves performance by re-ranking actions from a generalist policy using a value function learned via offline RL.", "The approach is compatible with various generalist policies without requiring fine-tuning or access to the policy's weights."], "second_cons": "The success of the approach depends on the quality of the offline reinforcement learning and the ability of the value function to accurately reflect the value of different actions.", "second_pros": "The approach is general and broadly applicable, improving policy performance consistently across multiple robotic platforms and tasks.", "summary": "This paper addresses the challenge of improving the precision and robustness of generalist robotic policies trained on diverse, but often noisy datasets.  Instead of computationally expensive and potentially detrimental fine-tuning, it proposes a novel test-time policy steering method, Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), that leverages a value function learned via offline RL to re-rank action proposals from a generalist policy.

It starts by discussing large-scale robotic datasets and policies, acknowledging the progress in collecting and utilizing massive, diverse datasets for training high-capacity models.  The section highlights the inherent challenges in such datasets, such as mixed data quality and the difficulty of ensuring optimal data for diverse robot embodiments.  The limitations of existing imitation learning methods in handling such data are also emphasized. The discussion shifts to value-based offline reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics, noting the potential of offline RL to improve policy performance compared to imitation learning methods. The section points out the limitations of existing offline RL approaches, especially their reliance on value functions that either restrict policy expressiveness or demand fine-tuning. The section also discusses the use of sampling-based action selection, particularly its efficacy in enhancing the capabilities of LLMs. This approach is framed as a relevant strategy for improving robotic policies at deployment time without needing the re-training or access to the underlying policy weights.  However, it points out that this method is not yet thoroughly explored in high-dimensional, real-world robotic manipulation problems.

It begins by establishing the context of controlling robots using language instructions, representing this interaction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).  The MDP formulation, M = (S, A, P, r, \u03b3), includes states (S), actions (A), transition probabilities (P), rewards (r), and a discount factor (\u03b3). Importantly, the approach assumes a black-box generalist robotic policy, \u03c0(\u03b1|st, l), which means the internal workings of the policy are not accessible, only its ability to output actions (\u03b1) given a state (st) and language instruction (l). The section highlights that the dataset D = {(\u03c4\u2081, l\u2081), (\u03c4\u2082, l\u2082),..., (\u03c4\u2099, l\u2099)} consists of language-annotated robot trajectories (\u03c4\u1d62) paired with their corresponding commands (l\u1d62).  The task completion is signaled by a sparse binary reward (+1 for success, 0 for failure) assigned to the last H=3 transitions of each trajectory. This sparse reward structure is crucial as it is the foundation upon which the value function will be learned via offline RL. The section concludes by briefly analyzing failure modes of generalist policies, setting the stage for the V-GPS method to address these shortcomings.", "first_cons": "The sparse reward structure might be overly simplistic for complex robotic tasks, potentially hindering the accuracy and generalizability of the learned value function.", "first_pros": "The black-box assumption for the generalist policy makes the V-GPS method widely applicable to diverse robotic policies without the need for modifications or fine-tuning.", "keypoints": ["The problem is framed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), providing a clear mathematical representation.", "The generalist robotic policy is treated as a black-box, highlighting a key assumption and broadening applicability.", "A sparse binary reward (+1 for success, 0 for failure) is assigned to the final 3 (H=3) steps of each trajectory, a crucial detail for offline RL training.", "The dataset consists of language-annotated robot trajectories, emphasizing the language-conditioned aspect of the problem."], "second_cons": "The section lacks detail on how the language instructions (l) are encoded and incorporated into the MDP framework and subsequent offline RL training.", "second_pros": "Formalizing the problem using an MDP and specifying the black-box policy provides a rigorous and well-defined foundation for the subsequent V-GPS method.", "summary": "This section establishes a formal framework for addressing the challenges of improving generalist robotic policies using language instructions.

The first failure mode is the inability to achieve precise grasping, particularly when dealing with slippery or oddly shaped objects.  The example given is the difficulty in reliably grasping a green pepper due to its smooth, uneven surface.  This results in the object frequently falling from the gripper. The second failure mode is related to the timing of actions. The policy is prone to dropping objects prematurely or holding onto them for an excessively long time, leading to task failures.  For instance, the policy prematurely drops a mushroom onto a cloth, or it holds onto a sushi piece too long causing it to be dropped outside the target container. The analysis highlights that imprecise actions and inappropriate timing significantly impair the performance of even seemingly successful grasps and maneuvers. This observation serves as the impetus for proposing the Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS) method in the subsequent sections, intended to mitigate these identified limitations.", "first_cons": "The analysis is limited to a single policy (Octo-small) and two specific failure modes.

The training process utilizes Conservative Q-learning (Cal-QL) to approximate the optimal value function while maintaining robustness to out-of-distribution (OOD) actions, aiming for a value function that is effective across multiple generalist policies.  During deployment, V-GPS samples multiple actions from the generalist policy, then uses the value function to re-rank these actions, ultimately selecting a high-value action for execution.
