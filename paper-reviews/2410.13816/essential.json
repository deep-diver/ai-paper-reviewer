Instead of retraining these large models which is computationally expensive and may lead to unintended loss of generalizability, V-GPS uses a value function learned via offline reinforcement learning (RL).  This value function acts as a filter that reranks the multiple action proposals made by the pre-trained robotic policy, selecting those with the highest predicted value.  Importantly, V-GPS works as a plug-and-play module; it doesn't need to fine-tune or even access the internal parameters of the existing policies.  Experimental results across 12 real-world and simulated robotic tasks, using 5 different state-of-the-art policies and 2 different robotic platforms, demonstrate consistent and substantial performance gains, often exceeding 80% improvement in some cases. The approach elegantly addresses common failure modes observed in pre-trained policies, like imprecise grasping and poorly timed actions. This research opens a new avenue for improving the reliability and efficiency of robotic systems, particularly in complex and unpredictable real-world scenarios. The modular nature of V-GPS makes it highly adaptable to different robots and tasks."}
