Instead of retraining or modifying these policies, V-GPS uses a separate value function (trained offline using reinforcement learning) to re-rank actions proposed by the policy at the time of execution.  This re-ranking process effectively steers the robot toward more successful task completion. The key finding is that this approach shows consistent improvement across multiple state-of-the-art robotic policies, various robotic platforms, and a range of tasks, all without any modification to the original policies. The value function acts as a post-processing step, enhancing action selection without altering the policy's core functionality. The research validates this approach through extensive testing on real robots and in realistic simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios. The simplicity and generality of V-GPS makes it easily adaptable and highly impactful for improving the robustness and performance of existing robotic systems."}
