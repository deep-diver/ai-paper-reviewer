It points out that while multi-head attention has proven effective in improving model accuracy in natural language processing and computer vision tasks, not all attention heads are equally important.  Existing research has demonstrated that a significant portion of attention heads can be pruned without substantial accuracy loss, indicating redundancy. The core argument presented is that a dynamic mechanism allowing tokens to selectively choose the most relevant attention heads could significantly enhance efficiency without compromising accuracy. This inefficiency stems from parallel operation of attention heads and redundant information processing. The paper then introduces Mixture-of-Head Attention (MoH) as a proposed solution that integrates multi-head attention with the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) mechanism to address these limitations.  It is presented as an architecture that dynamically routes attention heads to enhance the model's efficiency and unlock extra performance.", "first_cons": "The introduction section focuses primarily on the limitations of existing multi-head attention without delving into specific details of the proposed MoH architecture.

MoH addresses this by treating attention heads as experts in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework, allowing each token to select only the most relevant heads (Top-K selection).  This dynamic routing mechanism improves inference efficiency.  Furthermore, MoH replaces the standard summation with a weighted summation, introducing flexibility and potentially unlocking better performance.  A subset of heads are designated as \"shared heads,\" always active to consolidate common knowledge across different contexts.
