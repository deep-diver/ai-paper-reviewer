The core idea is that not all attention heads in a standard multi-head attention mechanism are equally important.  MoH treats attention heads as \"experts\" and allows each token to select the most appropriate heads dynamically, instead of using all of them. This reduces computational load and improves inference speed without sacrificing accuracy or increasing the number of parameters.  The researchers demonstrate MoH's effectiveness through extensive experiments on various model architectures, including vision transformers (ViT), diffusion transformers (DiT), and large language models (LLMs). They show that MoH outperforms standard multi-head attention while using significantly fewer heads, and it can also be effectively fine-tuned with pre-trained models. This innovative approach offers a potential solution to the computational challenges associated with large-scale AI model development."}
