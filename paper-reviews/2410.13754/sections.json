Existing evaluation methods are criticized for their inconsistencies across different modalities (e.g., text, image, audio), leading to fragmented progress and misleading signals. The authors identify three main biases undermining the reliability of evaluations: query bias (tasks not reflecting real-world distributions), grading bias (unfair scoring), and generalization bias (evaluation contamination). These biases affect both model development and user selection of appropriate models. The introduction sets the stage for the proposed MixEval-X benchmark by pointing out the inadequacies of current evaluation standards,  thus underscoring the need for a standardized and unbiased approach. The paper's introduction serves as a powerful motivator to examine these challenges and the necessity of developing better evaluation techniques.", "first_cons": "The introduction only briefly mentions specific examples of inconsistencies across evaluation communities, which might lack sufficient depth to fully convince readers of the scale of the problem.", "first_pros": "The introduction effectively identifies a significant problem in the field of AI model evaluation by highlighting inconsistencies, biases, and a lack of standardization across different modalities.", "keypoints": ["Inconsistencies in evaluation standards across different AI communities (text, audio, image, etc.) hinder overall progress.", "Three significant biases in current evaluations: query bias, grading bias, and generalization bias.", "MixEval (a prior work) successfully addressed these biases in text-based tasks, achieving 0.96 correlation to Chatbot Arena rankings and 6% of MMLU's time and cost."], "second_cons": "The introduction focuses heavily on the problems with existing evaluations, leaving the reader wanting more information about the specific solution offered by MixEval-X until later in the paper.", "second_pros": "The introduction provides a clear and concise overview of the current challenges in AI model evaluation.

It addresses two major issues in current evaluations: inconsistent standards and significant biases.  MixEval-X uses a web user query detection pipeline to gather real-world queries, which are then matched to similar tasks from existing benchmarks (for MMU tasks) or recreated using a novel adaptation-rectification pipeline (for MMG and agent tasks).  This pipeline helps to reconstruct real-world task distributions, ensuring that evaluations generalize effectively to real-world use cases.  MixEval-X includes eight input-output modality combinations categorized into three types: multi-modal understanding (MMU), multi-modal generation (MMG), and agent tasks.  The MMU tasks leverage benchmark mixture and rejection sampling for enhanced quality and challenge level while MMG and agent tasks utilize the adaptation-rectification pipeline to generate real-world tasks and annotations.  Grading methods vary across the modalities to accommodate different task types and community practices.  Meta-evaluations demonstrate that MixEval-X aligns benchmark samples with real-world task distributions and correlates strongly with crowd-sourced real-world evaluations (up to 0.98) while maintaining efficiency.
