These datasets often lack detailed rationales and focus on simpler tasks, hindering the development of robust MLLMs.  This limits the models' ability to tackle complex real-world problems requiring deeper reasoning. \nTo address these challenges, the researchers present MAmmoTH-VL, a novel approach to creating a large-scale multimodal instruction-tuning dataset. They leverage open-source models to rewrite existing datasets, adding detailed rationales and increasing task complexity.  This resulted in a dataset containing 12 million instruction-response pairs.  Training an MLLM on this dataset leads to **state-of-the-art performance** on various benchmarks, particularly those involving complex reasoning, showcasing the method's effectiveness. This work significantly contributes to the open-source MLLM community by offering a scalable and efficient way to build high-quality multimodal datasets.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.05237/podcast.wav"}
