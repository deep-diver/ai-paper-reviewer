CMs are preferred for their speed, but previous continuous-time versions struggled. This work introduces a new framework simplifying CM math and suggests key improvements in model design and training.  These advancements allow for training much larger CMs, resulting in significant performance gains, closing the gap with leading diffusion models by 10% while using far less computational power.  The improved models generate images with higher quality and better diversity, particularly under various guidance levels.  The research highlights the benefits of continuous-time methods and provides practical techniques for wider adoption and further research in this promising area."}
