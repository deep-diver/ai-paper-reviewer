Existing methods often lack precise control over different aspects of the generated world, hindering their use in applications like robotics & autonomous driving. \n\nTo tackle these issues, this paper introduces a novel conditional world generation model. It uses multiple spatial control inputs (segmentation, depth, edge) and applies adaptive weighting. This enables precise control and is customizable. The model is highly controllable and finds use in world-to-world transfers and can achieve real-time world generation through an inference scaling strategy.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.14492/podcast.wav"}
