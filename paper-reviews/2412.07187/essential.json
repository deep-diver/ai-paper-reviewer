Existing solutions, like secure multi-party computation or differential privacy, often lead to significant trade-offs between privacy and model accuracy. This paper introduces HyperFL, a novel FL framework that improves privacy by fundamentally altering how model updates are shared. \n\nHyperFL achieves this by employing hypernetworks to generate model parameters.  Instead of sharing the full model parameters, only the hypernetwork parameters (a smaller and less sensitive subset) are shared with the server for aggregation.  This technique effectively breaks the direct link between the training data and the shared parameters, making gradient inversion significantly harder.  The paper provides both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence demonstrating HyperFL's effectiveness in protecting privacy and maintaining good model performance, suggesting a substantial advancement in secure FL.", "affiliation": "School of Computing and Data Science, University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Federated Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2412.07187/podcast.wav"}
