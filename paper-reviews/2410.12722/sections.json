The evaluation process used ten different multimodal language models, both open- and closed-source, assessing their performance with and without image inputs.

The dataset's relatively small size (568 multiple-choice questions and images) is highlighted as a major limitation, particularly when compared to larger text-based benchmarks.

The study also points out that each question only has one image associated with it while real-world cases may involve multiple images from different modalities. Another limitation is that while there are English translations available,  more cross-validation is needed.  The study also admits that the lack of open-source multimodal medical language models limits the scope of evaluation.  The models used in the study were not initially trained for medical domains, hence their performance might be impacted.
