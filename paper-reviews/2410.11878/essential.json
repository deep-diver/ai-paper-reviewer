Instead of training separate models, NeuMeta learns a \"weight manifold,\" a continuous space where different network weights reside.  It uses an implicit neural representation (INR) to map coordinates within this manifold to corresponding weight values. This allows it to generate weights for networks with different sizes or even previously unseen architectures.  Two strategies are employed to improve the smoothness of this manifold.  First, intra-model smoothness is enhanced by solving a shortest Hamiltonian path problem on weight matrices. Second, cross-network smoothness is enhanced by adding noise during training to create a more flexible model.  The effectiveness of NeuMeta is shown on image classification, semantic segmentation, and image generation tasks, achieving high accuracy even with a 75% compression rate. This method shows significant potential for creating more efficient and adaptable neural networks."}
