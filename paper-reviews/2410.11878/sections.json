It first discusses efficient deep neural network methods, focusing on techniques like structure pruning (reducing computation by removing non-essential neurons) and flexible neural networks (adapting to various subnetwork configurations).  The limitations of these approaches are highlighted: pruning methods lead to performance degradation, while flexible networks still require multiple rigid models and training processes for different configurations.  Next, it explores continuous deep learning methods, such as those using continuous weight functions and Gaussian processes.  The section distinguishes NeuMeta from existing methods, noting that existing continuous neural networks are limited to their training configurations and lack generalizability to unseen sizes and operations. It also differentiates from existing hypernetworks, which usually learn weight distributions for a range of pre-defined network sizes, by highlighting that NeuMeta's implicit function is learned to produce weights for arbitrary sizes in a continuous space.  Finally, the section concludes by positioning NeuMeta as a new paradigm offering a flexible and efficient way to construct adaptable neural networks.

The goal is to create a function that maps any network configuration (e.g., size, architecture) to its optimal weights, allowing for the generation of networks with various sizes and structures without retraining.  The authors emphasize the importance of smoothness for this weight manifold.  Two strategies are presented:  Intra-model smoothness, addressing the non-smoothness within individual networks by formulating it as a multi-objective shortest Hamiltonian path problem (mSHP) to permute weight matrices effectively, and cross-model smoothness, improving the generalization across different network configurations by adding noise to the input coordinates during training.
