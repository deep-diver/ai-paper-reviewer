Existing solutions focus on increasing data size and quality, but these methods are often insufficient or inefficient. This paper introduces LOGO (Long context aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a novel training strategy that uses preference optimization to improve the alignment between the model's responses and the desired output.  LOGO addresses the GPU memory limitations inherent in training with long sequences by employing a reference-free preference optimization strategy. This approach, along with a position synthesis method for constructing training data, allows significant improvements in LCM performance with minimal data. Using only 0.3B training data on a single 8xA800 GPU, LOGO enabled a Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K model to reach performance comparable to GPT-4 in real-world long-context tasks, while maintaining its capabilities in other tasks and expanding the model's context window size.  The results suggest that focusing on the training objective, rather than solely on data size, is a more effective approach to enhancing LCM capabilities. This makes LOGO an attractive method for researchers aiming to develop more powerful and efficient long-context models."}
