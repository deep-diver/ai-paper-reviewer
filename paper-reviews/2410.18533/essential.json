Existing solutions to improve LCMs focus on increasing data size, which is expensive and inefficient. This paper introduces LOGO (Long context aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a new training strategy that uses preference optimization to better align LCM outputs with human preferences.  Instead of relying on massive datasets, LOGO uses a clever technique to construct training data that overcomes GPU memory limitations.  Experiments show that LOGO significantly improves LCM performance on real-world long-context tasks, bringing open-source models closer to the performance of GPT-4.  It's achieved with only 0.3B training data on a single 8xA800 GPU machine in 16 hours, making it a more efficient and accessible method.  LOGO also maintains the models\u2019 abilities on other tasks."}
