Existing methods to improve LCMs focus on increasing data size and quality, but these approaches are often ineffective or inefficient.  This paper introduces LOGO (Long context aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a novel training strategy that leverages preference optimization to align LCMs with human preferences.  To address the GPU memory constraints caused by long sequences, LOGO employs a reference-free optimization strategy and a position synthesis method for data construction.  The results show that LOGO allows a Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K model to achieve performance comparable to GPT-4 on real-world long-context tasks, using only 0.3B data and training for 16 hours on a single 8xA800 GPU machine. Importantly, LOGO preserves the model's original capabilities on other tasks and can significantly expand the model's context window size."}
