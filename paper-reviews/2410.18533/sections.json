However, current LCMs often produce unsatisfactory results like hallucinations and misaligned responses.  Existing research attempts to improve LCMs by increasing data size and quality for both pre-training and instruction tuning, but these methods lack effectiveness or efficiency. For example, the Llama-3.1-8B-128K model, pre-trained on around 300B long instruction data, underperforms the Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K model, trained with only 1.5B high-quality data.  Recent studies show that LCMs can accurately locate salient information in long contexts but struggle to utilize this for generation due to the training approach relying on token-level maximum likelihood loss (Cross-Entropy loss), where the longer context overshadows the prediction feedback.

LOGO addresses the challenge of misaligned responses from LCMs by incorporating preference optimization for long-context alignment.  This involves a two-pronged approach: first, a training objective that guides LCMs to distinguish between preferred (correct) and dis-preferred (misaligned) outputs; second, a data construction pipeline using only open-source models and a positional index synthesis method to circumvent GPU memory limitations.  The objective function is based on SimPO, adding a regularization term to prevent the model from losing its original capabilities.  The data construction pipeline includes importance scoring with an automatic evaluator to identify relevant and irrelevant context chunks, and a synthesis method to create training samples for both preference and dis-preference predictions.  Positional indices are synthesized to simulate long sequences with shorter data, enhancing training efficiency.  The process results in training data that is more efficient for long-context alignment.", "first_cons": "The LOGO training objective relies on an automatic evaluator to determine preference and dis-preference, which might introduce bias or inaccuracies if the evaluator is not sufficiently robust.

The process involved dividing each instance into 512-token chunks and using a named entity recognition model to assign importance scores for preference/dispreference data synthesis. 12,000 samples (~0.3B tokens) were created.  The training involved using LoRA to fine-tune attention and token embedding modules on a 8xA800 GPU machine (16 hours).  The LOGO strategy was evaluated on real-world long-context tasks (LongBench), a synthetic retrieval task (Needle-in-a-Haystack), and language modeling.  The study also compared LOGO's performance against other context scaling and instruction tuning methods. LOGO showed improvements in LongBench, approaching GPT-4 performance; it effectively scaled context windows in NIAH; and it preserved language modelling capabilities.  In short-context tasks, LOGO generally maintained performance, sometimes surpassing other methods.  An ablation study explored hyperparameter effects and data length variations, showing that the use of more dispreference instances improved real-world task results but impacted language modelling scores and increased memory consumption.
