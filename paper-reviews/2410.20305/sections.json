Traditional methods involve training a reward model that assigns scores to LLM responses, then using reinforcement learning to optimize the LLM. **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)**, however, directly optimizes the LLM using the log probabilities of chosen and rejected responses within pairs, without an intermediary reward model.  This is computationally more efficient as it eliminates the extra step of reward model training.

Prefix sharing combines chosen and rejected responses into a single sequence with a shared prefix, cleverly using a custom attention mask to prevent contamination between them. This eliminates redundant computations of the shared prompt. Sequence packing further improves efficiency by grouping multiple sequences into mini-batches for processing.  The authors illustrate how a custom attention mask is constructed to enable independent processing of the chosen and rejected responses within the single sequence.

The results show that prefix sharing offers near-ideal speedups for longer prefix lengths in the MLP layer, and while FlexAttention with prefix sharing shows improved performance over FlexAttention without it in the self-attention and full attention layers, the difference compared to FlashAttention-3 is less pronounced.
