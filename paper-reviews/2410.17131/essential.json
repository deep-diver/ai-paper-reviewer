Current methods often require significant human annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces Self-Steering Optimization (SSO), a novel algorithm that automatically generates high-quality preference signals during training, removing the need for manual labeling. SSO ensures the generated signals are both accurate and relevant to the current model, maximizing training efficiency. The researchers tested SSO using two well-known LLMs and demonstrated significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks, including both objective and subjective evaluations.  These improvements were achieved without any human input or reliance on external models.  Furthermore, the preference data generated by SSO proved beneficial for training reward models. The authors highlight the potential of SSO for efficient, scalable, and effective automated alignment of LLMs.  The method's focus on generating on-policy signals helps address challenges faced by previous automated alignment methods that sometimes produced signals that weren't relevant to the current model's capabilities.  The study confirms SSO's adaptability, as demonstrated by its effectiveness with both online and offline training, as well as in training reward models.  The work opens up new avenues for research in automated LLM alignment and contributes to advancing the capabilities of LLMs while minimizing human involvement in the process."}
