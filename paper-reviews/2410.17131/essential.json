Unlike previous methods that rely on human-annotated data or complex reward models, SSO automatically generates preference signals during the training process. It does this by using predefined principles to create pairs of responses, one considered \"good\" and one \"bad.\" SSO focuses on making sure these responses are relevant to the current model and maintaining a consistent difference in quality between them throughout the training. Experiments using Qwen2 and Llama3.1 showed that SSO leads to significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, including both subjective and objective evaluations.  The generated data also improved reward model training.  This method represents a substantial advance in automated alignment, offering a more efficient and scalable approach to the challenging problem of aligning LLMs with human preferences."}
