The authors highlight the challenges of existing alignment methods, primarily their reliance on substantial human annotation and the inherent limitations of human judgment in ensuring accurate and consistent preference data.  The current state-of-the-art methods, while effective, are hampered by scalability issues and the high cost of human involvement.  The introduction provides a brief overview of previous efforts in automated alignment, categorizing them into different approaches (off-policy and inaccurate). SSO, as described in this introduction, directly addresses these shortcomings by autonomously generating high-quality preference signals during iterative training, thereby eliminating the need for manual annotation.  The introduction also features performance results depicted in Figure 1, showcasing SSO's effectiveness across online, offline, and reward model training settings on Llama3.1-8B, indicating significant performance improvements across various benchmarks (e.g., a length control win rate increase in AlpacaEval 2.0 and improvements in the MT Bench).  Finally, the section concludes by mentioning the paper's objective: to introduce and validate a scalable and efficient approach to automated alignment, thereby establishing a pathway for more effective alignment systems with minimal human intervention.

It emphasizes that chosen and rejected responses, along with their signals, should primarily be on-policy, meaning easily extractable from the current policy model to match its learning capacity.  SSO maintains signal accuracy by ensuring a consistent gap between chosen and rejected responses while staying on-policy. This is achieved through three objectives: steering the model toward chosen responses generated using good principles, ensuring responses are approximately on-policy, and maintaining a consistent gap between chosen and rejected responses. The effectiveness of SSO is demonstrated on Qwen2 and Llama3.1 models, showing significant performance improvements across various benchmarks without any manual annotation or external models.
