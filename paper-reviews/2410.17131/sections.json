It operates by prompting the policy model with an original query and contrastive principles (good and bad) to generate responses. SSO optimizes the model with three objectives: steering towards chosen responses, ensuring near-on-policy responses, and maintaining a consistent gap between chosen and rejected responses.  This approach ensures both accuracy and on-policy behavior, improving the quality of preference signals over time.  The algorithm uses a modified principle-based automated alignment paradigm, incorporating a new optimization strategy.  SSO aims to generate accurate and learnable preference signals by controlling the quality gap between chosen and rejected responses via a self-steering loss, while also ensuring that these responses are learnable and on-policy through a weighted objective function. The weight function utilizes the average log probabilities of chosen and rejected responses, emphasizing on-policy behavior.  The effectiveness of SSO was validated using Qwen2 and Llama3.1 models, showing significant performance improvements across six subjective or objective benchmarks without any manual annotation or external models.", "first_cons": "The design of the weighting function and self-steering loss function might be oversimplified, potentially limiting its effectiveness and requiring further optimization to ensure robust performance across various scenarios.", "first_pros": "SSO efficiently generates high-quality preference signals automatically, eliminating the need for manual annotation and reducing costs associated with human annotation.
