The researchers chose the TRUE benchmark, a collection of 11 datasets encompassing various NLP tasks like summarization, dialogue, fact verification, and paraphrasing, all under a unified binary factual consistency labeling scheme. They selected four datasets, one from each task category, each containing 1000 examples (or the entire dataset if smaller).  From each chosen dataset, 160 examples were randomly selected as a test set for evaluating the accuracy of several annotation methods and 840 for training.  Three annotation approaches were employed: (1) Crowd-sourcing via Amazon Mechanical Turk, with annotations manually reviewed and re-annotated if necessary until three annotators agreed on each example, to avoid the use of LLMs by the annotators; (2) Expert annotation, where two authors of the paper, familiar with the task, provided annotations independently, then reconciled any disagreements; and (3) LLM-based annotation, which involved using an ensemble of four LLMs (GPT-4, PaLM2, Mistral, and Llama) with varied prompts to generate labels, focusing on their confidence scores to flag potential mislabeling cases.

The study uses a unified binary factual consistency label and carefully designed annotation protocols to evaluate the agreement, quality, and efficiency of each approach, aiming to quantify the extent of mislabeled data and assess the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and potentially correcting label errors. The approach involved using a test set of 640 instances and a training set of 2880 for model fine-tuning, to allow the assessment of performance in the presence of mislabeled examples.  The researchers explored how these label errors impact the evaluation of model performance, which may lead to incorrect conclusions about models' abilities if not appropriately accounted for.  The results suggest a significant issue of human error in labeling, particularly in crowd-sourced data. The work proposes methodologies for mitigating these errors in model training and evaluation, improving overall model performance.  The main focus is on systematically identifying and handling label errors, using LLMs and human expert evaluation for a thorough analysis of accuracy and agreement rates across the different methods.  The researchers measured the consistency between different annotators across all methods using the weighted F1-score and Fleiss's Kappa statistic, and compared their performance against a gold standard derived from reconciled expert labels. The goal is to establish how LLMs can assist in improving the accuracy of labeling data, while quantifying the impact of existing label errors on NLP model performance.   The experiment focused on a test set of 640 data points (160 from each of the four datasets), allowing careful manual analysis of annotation inconsistencies. This data and subsequent analysis provide valuable insights into the accuracy of different labeling techniques, particularly those involving LLMs. The experiment includes detailed discussions on the consistency of the labeling data obtained through different methods, including the use of metrics like Fleiss's Kappa to quantify inter-annotator agreement and analyze error rates among the annotations.
