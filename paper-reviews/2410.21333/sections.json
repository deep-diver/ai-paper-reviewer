It focuses on three main areas: **implicit statistical learning**, where verbalizing rules hinders learning patterns; **verbal overshadowing**, where describing a face makes recognition harder; and learning with exceptions, where explaining general rules leads to slower learning when exceptions exist. These cases highlight how deliberation can hurt performance when it mismatches the optimal processing method for the task.  The section then briefly discusses three other cases where verbalization is detrimental to humans but argues those cases are less likely to generalize to LLMs due to fundamental differences between human and AI cognitive abilities.", "first_cons": "The connection between human deliberation and AI models' chain-of-thought prompting is not fully established.

Three tasks where human deliberation harms performance (implicit statistical learning, facial recognition, classifying data with exceptions) show that CoT significantly reduces LLM accuracy.
