Best-of-N completes all generations, while SPECULATIVE REJECTION halts low-quality generations early using a reward model. Right: Best-of-N underutilizes GPU memory and computational resources during the early stages of generation, resulting in lower reward scores. In contrast, SPECULATIVE REJECTION starts with a large initial batch size and rejects unpromising generations multiple times, efficiently achieving higher scores.", "description": "The figure illustrates how Speculative Rejection improves upon Best-of-N by strategically halting low-quality generations early, leading to greater efficiency and higher reward scores.", "section": "4 SPECULATIVE REJECTION"}]
