Current alignment techniques often involve complex post-training, slowing down deployment.  Inference-time alignment methods, such as Best-of-N, avoid post-training but suffer from high computational costs at inference. This limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. \nThe paper introduces Speculative Rejection, a novel inference-time alignment algorithm. It addresses the efficiency issues of Best-of-N by selectively rejecting low-scoring partial sequences during generation.  **By dynamically adjusting the batch size, it makes high-N Best-of-N decoding computationally viable, even on a single GPU.**  Experiments demonstrate a significant speedup (16-32x) compared to Best-of-N, while maintaining comparable alignment quality. This opens new possibilities for efficient and large-scale LLM deployments."}
