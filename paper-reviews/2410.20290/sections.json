It leverages the observation that the relative ranking of partial utterances often predicts the final ranking, allowing the algorithm to terminate low-performing sequences early. This method begins with a large batch to capture promising responses, then iteratively uses a reward model to identify and reject low-scoring partial sequences, thus balancing resource utilization with achieving high-quality outputs.\n\nThe algorithm uses a stopping fraction (\u03b1) to determine how aggressively to reject low-scoring sequences. A large batch size is initially used, mimicking the Best-of-N method with a high N value,  but unlike the Best-of-N method, the algorithm dynamically shrinks the batch size across multiple rounds of rejection.  In each round, it evaluates partial sequences, computes a threshold, rejects low-scoring candidates, and continues generating the more promising ones. The final output is the highest-scoring complete sequence among those generated.
