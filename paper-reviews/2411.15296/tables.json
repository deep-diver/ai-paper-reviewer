"TABLE I: Statistics of representative MLLM benchmarks.", "description": "This table provides a summary of key statistics for several prominent Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks.  For each benchmark, it lists the number of question-answer pairs, the type of answers (open-ended, multiple choice, yes/no), the type of metrics used for evaluation, the categories the benchmark falls into (e.g., comprehensive evaluation, OCR, video understanding), the method used for data collection (gathering from the internet, incorporating from existing datasets, modifying existing data, or automatically constructing pairs), and finally, the annotation method (manual or automatic). This detailed information helps researchers quickly compare and contrast various MLLM evaluation benchmarks and choose those most suitable for their research needs.", "section": "3 BENCHMARK CATEGORIES"}]
