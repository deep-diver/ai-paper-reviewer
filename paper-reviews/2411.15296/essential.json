{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in the field of multimodal large language models (MLLMs).  It provides a **comprehensive survey** of MLLM evaluation, addressing key challenges and guiding future research directions. The **systematic taxonomy** of benchmarks and evaluation methods offers valuable insights and facilitates easier identification of suitable methods for different research needs.  Furthermore, the paper **highlights gaps** in current MLLM evaluation practices, paving the way for new research in improved benchmarks and methodologies.", "summary": "This survey paper offers a comprehensive overview of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) evaluation, systematically categorizing benchmarks and methods, and identifying gaps for future research, thereby advancing the field.", "takeaways": ["A systematic taxonomy of MLLM evaluation benchmarks is proposed, categorized by foundational capabilities, model behavior, and extended applications.", "The paper identifies key limitations in existing MLLM evaluation methods, highlighting the need for more comprehensive and robust evaluation strategies.", "Future research directions are outlined, focusing on better-defined capability taxonomies, capability-oriented evaluation, task-oriented evaluation, and the incorporation of more modalities."], "tldr": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their evaluation remains fragmented and inconsistent. This paper addresses this challenge by providing a comprehensive survey of existing MLLM evaluation methods and benchmarks.  It highlights the lack of a standardized evaluation framework and the need for more robust and comprehensive assessment strategies.\nThe paper offers a structured taxonomy of MLLM benchmarks, distinguishing evaluations based on foundational capabilities, model behavior and extended applications. It provides guidelines on constructing benchmarks, selecting appropriate evaluation methods, and identifying key challenges such as data leakage and the need for vision-centric evaluations.  The authors discuss future research directions that would improve MLLM evaluation, such as developing well-defined capability taxonomies, incorporating more modalities, and establishing task-oriented evaluation frameworks.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.15296/podcast.wav"}
