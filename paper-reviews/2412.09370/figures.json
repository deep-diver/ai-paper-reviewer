First, a retriever component identifies the top-k candidate senses for the input text, effectively performing Candidate Generation. Second, a reader component identifies the spans within the input text that need disambiguation, executing Concept Detection. Finally, the reader links each of these identified spans to its most suitable sense from the candidate senses, completing the Word Sense Disambiguation step. The overall process demonstrates how the WSL model determines both what parts of text to disambiguate and which meanings to assign to them.", "section": "3 Model"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.09370/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 2: The counts of four POS categories (NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV) for three different datasets (Senseval2, Senseval3, Semeval2015).
