{"importance": "This paper is crucial because it addresses the limitations of existing Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems. By introducing Word Sense Linking (WSL) and a novel architecture, it offers **a more practical and realistic approach to WSD**, bridging the gap between academic research and real-world applications. This work opens new avenues for improving the integration of lexical semantics into downstream tasks, impacting various NLP areas.  Its comprehensive evaluation and dataset release also benefit the broader NLP community.", "summary": "Word Sense Linking (WSL) revolutionizes word sense disambiguation by tackling its real-world limitations.  It combines span identification and sense linking in plain text, offering better integration into downstream applications.", "takeaways": ["Word Sense Linking (WSL) improves word sense disambiguation by addressing limitations of current systems.", "A novel, flexible transformer-based architecture effectively handles WSL, exceeding the performance of adapted WSD systems.", "The introduced WSL dataset and evaluation framework advance WSD research, paving the way for real-world applications."], "tldr": "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) struggles with real-world applications due to its assumptions of pre-identified spans and provided sense candidates. This paper introduces Word Sense Linking (WSL), a new task that addresses these limitations. WSL combines span identification and sense linking directly from text, making it more practical and applicable. \nThe proposed approach uses a transformer-based retriever-reader architecture.  The retriever generates candidate senses, while the reader identifies spans and links them to their most suitable meaning.  Experiments show the superiority of this approach over adapting state-of-the-art WSD systems to WSL, highlighting significant performance gains, especially in recall, while addressing the challenges of real-world, unconstrained settings. **The work also introduces a novel WSL dataset, enriching the existing WSD benchmark and furthering future research.**", "affiliation": "Sapienza University of Rome", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Word Sense Disambiguation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.09370/podcast.wav"}
