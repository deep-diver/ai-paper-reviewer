The authors propose asynchronous RLHF, where sample generation and model training occur concurrently and independently. This allows leveraging highly optimized LLM inference libraries for faster generation, while simultaneously training on previously generated samples (off-policy). They discover that the performance of various RLHF algorithms varies significantly under off-policy training, with Online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) proving most robust.  Interestingly, increasing the policy model size improved the robustness to off-policy data but scaling the reward model did not show similar effects. Experiments on the TLDR summarization task and a large-scale instruction-following task with a 8B parameter LLaMA model demonstrate that asynchronous RLHF achieves comparable performance to synchronous methods but significantly faster training time (up to 40% faster).  This research introduces an important technique to accelerate LLM training, opening new avenues for research in more efficient RLHF methods and also highlights challenges in asynchronous RLHF, such as efficiently handling generation and training speed mismatches."}
