However, the dominant approach, online on-policy RL, is computationally expensive, often requiring weeks of training for state-of-the-art LLMs.  This is because it synchronously generates responses, labels them with a reward model, and then updates the LLM's policy.  The paper introduces the concept of asynchronous off-policy RLHF as a more efficient alternative, inspired by classical deep RL literature, where generation and learning are decoupled. This allows for asynchronous generation of samples and simultaneous training on older samples, leading to faster training and potentially better compute-optimal scaling. The paper intends to explore the challenges and implications of learning off-policy data in RLHF, specifically investigating how much off-policy data the training can tolerate while still maintaining performance.  Existing offline methods, while efficient, underperform online methods.

It involves collecting human feedback on model-generated responses, training a reward model to predict human preferences, and then using reinforcement learning to fine-tune the LLM to maximize the reward.  The standard approach is *online on-policy RL*, where the LLM generates samples, receives immediate feedback, and updates its policy based on that feedback synchronously. This process is computationally expensive, especially for large LLMs, often requiring weeks of training.  This section introduces RLHF as a method to align LLMs with hard-to-quantify human preferences using human feedback and details the existing online, on-policy approach, highlighting its inefficiency.  Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is mentioned as a common algorithm for this task, but the section also touches upon newer methods like REINFORCE Leave-One-Out (RLOO) and Online DPO, which offer potentially competitive performance.
