Unlike traditional approaches that rely on large and computationally expensive foundation models, LiMAC uses a lightweight architecture combining a small Action Transformer (AcT) and a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). AcT handles simple actions efficiently, while the VLM takes over for complex tasks involving natural language.  Evaluated on two datasets, LiMAC demonstrates superior performance compared to models using only fine-tuned open-source VLMs or prompt engineering with closed-source models like GPT-4.  LiMAC achieves up to a 19% increase in action accuracy over fine-tuned VLMs and a 42% increase over prompt-engineering baselines.  It also boasts significantly faster execution times, up to 30 times faster, reaching speeds of around 3 seconds per task. The researchers also introduce a contrastive learning objective to improve the accuracy of click actions. The results show that LiMAC efficiently and accurately controls mobile apps, addressing the limitations of previous methods in terms of speed, accuracy, and computational resources."}
