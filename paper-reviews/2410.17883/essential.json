Instead of relying on large, slow language models, LiMAC uses a smaller, faster Action Transformer (AcT) combined with a vision-language model (VLM). The AcT handles simple actions like clicking and scrolling, while the VLM is used for more complex tasks requiring language understanding (like writing a text message).  Testing showed LiMAC is much faster (up to 30 times) and more accurate (up to 42% improvement) than using larger language models alone.  This is important because smartphones have limited computing power, making large models impractical for many tasks.  The researchers used two open-source datasets for testing and compared LiMAC's performance to several other methods, showcasing its superior efficiency and accuracy."}
