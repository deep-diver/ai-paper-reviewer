These agents can help users perform a wide variety of tasks, such as scheduling appointments, sending messages, purchasing items, and booking flights, with minimal effort.  App agents achieve this by observing user instructions and interacting with the smartphone's user interface (clicking, scrolling, typing, etc.). However, the limited computational resources of smartphones present a significant challenge.  App agents need to be optimized for efficiency, using lightweight models that minimize memory usage and processing time. Recent advances have leveraged foundation models to create app agents that can understand natural language instructions and perform complex actions.  However, using foundation models for every action has significant drawbacks: their substantial size and computational complexity make them resource-intensive and impractical for constant use on mobile devices. Querying server-hosted foundation models for each task is also prohibitively expensive due to operational costs.  For example, a state-of-the-art GPT-40-based app agent may take one to two minutes to run and cost approximately \\$1.00 per task.  These limitations highlight the need for more efficient and cost-effective approaches to app agent development.", "first_cons": "Foundation models are resource-intensive and impractical for constant use on mobile devices due to their size and computational complexity.", "first_pros": "App agents can automate a wide variety of tasks on smartphones with minimal user effort.", "keypoints": ["App agents extend AI capabilities to smartphones and mobile devices.", "They automate tasks such as scheduling, messaging, purchasing, and booking.", "Limited smartphone resources require efficient, lightweight models.", "Foundation models offer sophisticated capabilities but are resource-intensive and expensive.", "A GPT-40 based agent may take 1-2 minutes per task and cost approximately $1.00 per task"], "second_cons": "Querying server-hosted foundation models for each task is expensive due to operational costs.", "second_pros": "Recent advancements have leveraged foundation models to develop app agents that understand natural language and execute complex commands.", "summary": "Smartphone app agents offer significant potential for automating tasks but face challenges due to limited device resources and the high cost and resource demands of using large foundation models for each task.
