Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential for better communication but struggle with real-time decision-making. Issues include adapting to dynamic environments, handling unpredictable human behaviors, and navigating diverse scenarios. These limitations impact the safety and efficiency of AVs.\n\nTo address this, a parallel Actor-Reasoner framework is introduced. It leverages LLMs for real-time AV-HV interactions across various scenarios. By simulating interactions between the LLM-driven Reasoner and heterogeneous simulated HVs, an interaction memory database (Actor) is created. This framework enhances safety and efficiency. The effectiveness is confirmed through field tests.
