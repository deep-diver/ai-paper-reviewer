Existing systems either make simplistic binary decisions or are computationally expensive, leading to unreliable evaluations and hindering the development of more robust AI systems.  This research highlights a critical need for more sophisticated and efficient verification techniques. \n\nThe paper introduces Dyve, a novel dynamic process verifier that employs a dual-system approach mimicking human cognitive processes: 'fast' (immediate token-level confirmation) and 'slow' (comprehensive analysis) thinking.  Dyve leverages Monte Carlo estimation and a novel step-wise consensus-filtered supervision to improve accuracy. Experiments show that **Dyve significantly outperforms other methods** on various benchmarks, particularly excelling on more complex reasoning tasks, and demonstrating the effectiveness of its dual-system approach in achieving high accuracy with reasonable computational efficiency.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.11157/podcast.wav"}
