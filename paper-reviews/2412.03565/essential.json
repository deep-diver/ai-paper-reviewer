Existing methods often fail to capture nuanced relationships between objects or track instances effectively over time. This limits their real-world applicability in tasks requiring precise comprehension of visual details. \n\nTo address this, the researchers introduce INST-IT.  This involves creating a new benchmark (INST-IT Bench) for evaluating instance understanding, developing a large-scale dataset (INST-IT Dataset) with detailed instance annotations generated using an automated pipeline with GPT-40, and proposing a continuous instruction tuning approach. Their method significantly improves instance understanding across various benchmarks, highlighting the importance of explicit visual cues and demonstrating the potential of this approach for building better multimodal AI systems.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Innovation Institute Huawei Noah's Ark Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.03565/podcast.wav"}
