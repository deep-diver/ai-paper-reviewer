This can lead to biased models that don't meet the needs of all users.  Collecting detailed preference data is also expensive and difficult to scale.\nThis paper introduces Decomposed Reward Models (DRMs) to address these issues. **DRMs represent human preferences as vectors, and use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract orthogonal basis vectors that capture distinct aspects of preference**. These reward components can be flexibly combined to align with various user needs, offering a scalable and interpretable alternative to traditional methods.  Experiments show that DRMs effectively extract meaningful preference dimensions and adapt to new users at test time without additional training.", "affiliation": "Rice University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.13131/podcast.wav"}
