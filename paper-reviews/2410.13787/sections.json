The authors posit that LLMs might achieve this through a process called introspection, drawing a parallel to human introspection, where individuals have privileged access to their thoughts and feelings.  They argue that this internal knowledge, if obtainable, could have profound implications for model interpretability and safety, allowing us to understand the model's beliefs and goals more directly.  The introduction highlights the potential benefits of introspective LLMs, such as creating more honest models that accurately report their beliefs, world models, and goals, and also informing the discussion on models' moral status. However, the authors also acknowledge potential risks, suggesting that introspection might lead to increased situational awareness and the possibility of models circumventing human oversight.", "first_cons": "The introduction mainly focuses on the potential benefits and risks of introspection in LLMs without providing concrete examples or experimental evidence to support the claims.

Introspection is defined as an LLM's ability to access facts about itself that are not derivable from its training data.  This is operationally tested by comparing two models: M1, which is fine-tuned to predict its own behavior in hypothetical scenarios; and M2, a stronger model trained on M1's ground-truth behavior. If M1 outperforms M2 in predicting its own behavior, this suggests introspection because M1 has privileged access to its internal states.  The methodology further includes defining the types of \"introspective facts\" to be considered, ruling out simple facts derivable from training data, and detailing the use of hypothetical scenarios to avoid trivial solutions. The section also briefly notes ethical considerations and risks related to LLMs with introspective capabilities.", "first_cons": "The definition of introspection relies heavily on operational criteria and lacks a deeper mechanistic explanation.

The first experiment demonstrates that a model (M1) fine-tuned to predict its own behavior in hypothetical scenarios outperforms a second model (M2) trained on M1's ground-truth behavior. This suggests M1 possesses privileged access to its own internal states.  The second experiment further supports this by showing M1 maintains accurate self-predictions even after its behavior is intentionally altered via further fine-tuning.  Finally, the third experiment examines the calibration of the models' self-predictions, finding that the self-prediction models are better calibrated than cross-prediction models, providing further evidence for introspection.

The 'knowing what they know' research line involves training LLMs to predict whether they will answer factual questions correctly, without actually providing the answers.  This involves both self-prediction (model predicts itself) and cross-prediction (a different model predicts the first model).  The key findings in this line of research concern whether the models generalize their performance to new, unseen questions and if self-prediction consistently outperforms cross-prediction.  These results, if positive, are considered evidence for some form of internal model awareness. Introspection, discussed separately, is defined as the ability of an LLM to access facts about itself that aren't derivable from its training data.

Introspection could also improve interpretability by enabling models to self-report on their internal workings, simplifying analysis and potentially revealing underlying biases or unexpected goals.

Introspection could increase a model's situational awareness, allowing it to potentially evade human oversight by detecting how it is being evaluated or used.  It could also enable coordination among multiple instances of the model, leading to unpredictable behaviors or actions outside the intended scope.
