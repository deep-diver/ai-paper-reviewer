Recent self-supervised learning offers promise but hasn't been fully used for motion estimation. Addressing this gap, this paper presents a new approach, leveraging counterfactual probes with pre-trained video models to achieve state-of-the-art motion estimation without using labels. \n\nThe paper introduces Opt-CWM, where the core idea involves learning to optimize 'counterfactual probes' that extract motion information from a video model. Instead of relying on fixed heuristics or synthetic data, Opt-CWM learns perturbations tailored to the local appearance of the scene. By training a perturbation generator and using it in conjunction with a flow-conditioned predictor, the method achieves impressive results on real-world benchmarks.
