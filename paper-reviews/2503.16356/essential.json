Existing KE methods struggle with integrating updated information into reasoning pathways because they focus on single or few model layers. This leads to inconsistent knowledge propagation and poor performance in downstream reasoning tasks.\n\nThis paper introduces **CaKE, a novel method that enhances the integration of updated knowledge in LLMs**. CaKE uses strategically curated data to enforce the model to utilize the modified knowledge, stimulating the development of appropriate reasoning circuits. Experimental results demonstrate that CaKE improves use of updated knowledge across reasoning tasks, improving the accuracy.", "affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16356/podcast.wav"}
