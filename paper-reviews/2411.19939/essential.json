Prior research suggests that simply using text-based unlearning to align MLLMs can achieve comparable safety, which seems counter-intuitive. This paper investigates this phenomenon and discovers the problem of \"visual safety information leakage\" (VSIL) in existing multimodal safety benchmarks.  VSIL means that sensitive image content has been revealed in the textual query, enabling MLLMs to easily detect and reject harmful queries based solely on textual inputs.\nTo address VSIL, the researchers created VLSBench, a new multimodal visual leak-free safety benchmark.  This benchmark poses a more realistic challenge for evaluating true MLLM safety. Experiments show that, unlike datasets with VSIL,  **multimodal alignment significantly outperforms textual alignment in VLSBench**, indicating the importance of multimodal safety techniques. This challenges the current understanding of multimodal safety and highlights the need for dedicated multimodal safety benchmarks and evaluation metrics.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.19939/podcast.wav"}
