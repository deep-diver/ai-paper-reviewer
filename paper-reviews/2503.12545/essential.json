However, their dependence on vast amounts of internet data raises privacy concerns. Machine unlearning(MU) is a solution, allowing removal of knowledge from trained models without retraining. Existing MU evaluations are incomplete and poorly defined, hindering secure system development. Prior benchmarks are limited to discrete entities and overlook the coupling of concepts within images.\n\nThis paper introduces **a new benchmark designed to evaluate machine unlearning(MU) performance in Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs)**. The benchmark assesses both personal entity and general event unlearning, revealing limitations of current MU methods. It benchmarks MU methods, revealing strengths and weaknesses, providing guidance for future improvements and enhances the security of multimodal models.", "affiliation": "HIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.12545/podcast.wav"}
