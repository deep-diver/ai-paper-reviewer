Cooperative perception methods using vehicle-to-vehicle communication improve this but are largely limited to detection and tracking, leaving overall cooperative planning performance underexplored.  This paper aims to address these limitations.\nThe paper proposes V2V-LLM, a novel method that integrates a large language model (LLM) into vehicle-to-vehicle cooperative autonomous driving.  It introduces a new dataset (V2V-QA) for this problem setting and benchmarks V2V-LLM against baseline methods with various fusion approaches.  **Results show that V2V-LLM effectively fuses perception information from multiple vehicles and outperforms other methods in critical tasks like notable object identification and planning**, paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous driving.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "2502.09980/podcast.wav"}
