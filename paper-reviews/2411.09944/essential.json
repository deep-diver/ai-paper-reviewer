"], "tldr": "Current small language models (SLMs) show potential for mobile deployment, but their real-world performance and applications on smartphones remain underexplored.  Existing research primarily focuses on developing smaller models without extensive real-device testing, leaving a gap in understanding their practical performance on high-end devices.  There's a need for in-depth studies to bridge this gap. \nThis paper introduces SlimLM, a series of SLMs optimized for mobile document assistance tasks.  The researchers conducted extensive experiments on a Samsung Galaxy S24, identifying optimal trade-offs between model size, context length, and inference time. SlimLM was pre-trained and fine-tuned on a specific dataset.  The results show that SlimLM models perform comparably or even better than existing SLMs of similar sizes and an Android application demonstrates real-world applicability.", "affiliation": "Auburn University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.09944/podcast.wav"}
