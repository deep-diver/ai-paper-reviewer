{"importance": "This paper introduces a new way to approach autoregressive image generation, **balancing generation quality and computational efficiency**. It offers new insight and methods for researchers working on image synthesis, generative modeling, and representation learning. The CTF framework provides a **promising direction** for future research in autoregressive models, particularly in scenarios where large codebooks are used. The code release also encourages reproducibility and further exploration by the community.", "summary": "Coarse-to-Fine Token Prediction improves autoregressive image generation by assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens, balancing generation quality and computational efficiency.", "takeaways": ["Coarse-to-fine token prediction reduces vocabulary redundancy in autoregressive image generation.", "K-means clustering provides a systematic method for assigning coarse labels.", "Fine labels can be efficiently predicted conditioned on coarse labels."], "tldr": "**Autoregressive models** are great for image generation, but they require discretizing continuous pixel data. To reduce errors from this process, recent works use **larger codebooks**, which expands vocabulary size and complicates autoregressive modeling. This paper aims to find a way to enjoy the benefits of large codebooks without making autoregressive modeling more difficult. The problem is that tokens with similar codeword representations produce similar effects on the final generated image, revealing redundancy in large codebooks. \n\nThis paper introduces **Coarse-to-Fine (CTF) token prediction**, realized by assigning the same coarse label for similar tokens. The framework consists of (1) an autoregressive model that predicts coarse labels sequentially, and (2) an auxiliary model that predicts fine-grained labels for all tokens conditioned on their coarse labels. CTF can maintain large codebook sizes for quality reconstruction while simplifying the autoregressive modeling task. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate superior performance and faster sampling speeds.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16194/podcast.wav"}
