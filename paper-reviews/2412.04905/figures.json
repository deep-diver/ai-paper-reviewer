We have formulated the comprehensive elements of the Prelude, Interlocution, and Epilogue stages of a complete dialogue.", "description": "This figure illustrates the Dialogue Element Modeling task, which consists of two main parts: Element Awareness and Dialogue Agent Interaction.  Element Awareness focuses on identifying key elements within a dialogue, such as the goal, persona, scene, and utterance. Dialogue Agent Interaction involves simulating a multi-turn dialogue between agents, where each agent's actions are guided by their understanding of these elements. The figure shows how these elements are structured across the three stages of a complete dialogue: the Prelude (setting the scene and goals), the Interlocution (the main exchange), and the Epilogue (summarizing and concluding). The interplay between the dialogue and its constituent elements is also visually represented.", "section": "2 Dialogue Element Modeling"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04905/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of our DEMO synthesis framework, which consists of five steps: (1)\u00a0Goal and Scene Distillation, (2)\u00a0Persona Design, (3)\u00a0Conflict Assessment, (4)\u00a0Dialogue Generation, (5)\u00a0Quality Control.

The steps are: 1) Goal and Scene Distillation: extracts goals and scenes from a large dialogue corpus.  2) Persona Design: generates diverse personas with detailed attributes. 3) Conflict Assessment: evaluates the coherence of goal, scene, and persona combinations. 4) Dialogue Generation: generates dialogues based on the approved combinations. 5) Quality Control: ensures the quality of the generated data through multiple checks.

It details the structure of a complete dialogue, dividing it into three key stages: Prelude, Interlocution, and Epilogue. Each stage comprises various elements such as goal, scene, persona, and utterance, which are meticulously analyzed in the DEMO task. The Prelude sets the context with elements like the goal and persona of each participant, along with the overall scene.  Interlocution focuses on the exchange of utterances, incorporating the intent and sentiment expressed. Finally, the Epilogue summarizes the entire dialogue, assessing goal achievement and the overall information flow. This figure serves to illustrate the complexity of dialogue and the comprehensive nature of the proposed DEMO evaluation framework.", "section": "2 Dialogue Element Modeling"}]
