Traditional methods struggle with pose initialization, while learning-based approaches lack generalization. Prior works use either registration or fitting approaches. Registration focuses on matching the outer surface, whereas fitting emphasizes aligning with the underlying body. However, existing methods don't generalize well to varying poses, shapes, and clothing styles. Some approaches try to address this by separating the garment layers from the underlying body, but still, struggle with the out-of-distribution post or shapes. \n\nThis paper introduces **ETCH**, a novel pipeline that estimates cloth-to-body surface mapping through locally approximate SE(3) equivariance. It encodes tightness as displacement vectors from the cloth surface to the underlying body. Following this mapping, pose-invariant body features regress sparse body markers, simplifying clothed human fitting into an inner-body marker fitting task. Extensive experiments on CAPE and 4D-Dress show that ETCH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in body fitting accuracy, both tightness-agnostic and tightness-aware.", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10624/podcast.wav"}
