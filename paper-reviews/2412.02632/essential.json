Existing methods often rely on outdated techniques and biased comparisons, hindering progress in high-resolution image generation.  There is also a need for efficient training strategies and better understanding of latent space utilization in different compression scenarios. \nThis research introduces Grouped Spherical Quantization (GSQ), a novel quantization method for image tokenizers.  **GSQ addresses the limitations of existing approaches by using spherical codebook initialization and lookup regularization to constrain the codebook latent to a spherical surface.** This leads to superior reconstruction quality with fewer training iterations. The authors systematically analyze GSQ's scaling behavior across different dimensions and compression levels, revealing distinct behavior at high and low compression. **GSQ effectively manages increased spatial compression by restructuring high-dimensional latent space into compact, lower-dimensional spaces.** This improves efficient scaling and enhances reconstruction quality, achieving a remarkable 16x downsampling with a reconstruction FID (rFID) of 0.50.", "affiliation": "J\u00fclich Supercomputing Centre", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.02632/podcast.wav"}
