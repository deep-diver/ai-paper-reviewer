R2-T2 significantly enhances performance of the 7B base MoE model, surpassing a recent 13B VLM.", "description": "This figure displays a comparison of the performance of the R2-T2 method applied to the MoAI-7B model against various other Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with different parameter sizes (7B, 8B, and 13B) across nine benchmark datasets.  The bar chart visually represents the improvement in performance achieved by R2-T2 on each benchmark.  The key finding is that R2-T2 substantially improves the performance of the smaller 7B MoE model, even surpassing the performance of a larger 13B VLM in some cases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of R2-T2 in enhancing the capabilities of multimodal Mixture-of-Experts models.", "section": "4 Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.20395/extracted/6189153/fig/example.png", "caption": "Figure 2: An example of how R2-T2 optimizes the routing weights.

A test sample is given to the model, and the model initially selects the wrong expert for processing, resulting in an incorrect answer.  R2-T2 then searches for similar correctly-answered questions in a reference set. By analyzing these similar questions (k-Nearest Neighbors or kNN), R2-T2 identifies the most relevant samples. Based on the identified samples, R2-T2 adjusts the routing weights for the input test sample. This adjustment involves shifting the top-ranked expert from one that primarily focuses on aligning visual features with language (\"ILANG\") to one that better integrates auxiliary computer vision features (\"IAUX\").  This expert shift leads to a correction of the initial wrong answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the R2-T2 approach in dynamically optimizing routing weights during test time.", "section": "3 Test-Time Re-Routing"}]
