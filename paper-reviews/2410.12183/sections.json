It begins by addressing the limitations of single models in handling diverse downstream tasks.  To address this issue, it leverages a collection of 11 heterogeneous agents\u2014models specialized in different vision, language, and multimodal tasks.  These agents' knowledge is transferred to the foundation model using a unified knowledge distillation framework, avoiding the expense and complexity of model ensemble methods. The method incorporates three key collaborations: Vision Agent Collaboration (VAC), Language Agent Collaboration (LAC), and Multi-modal Agent Collaboration (MAC).  VAC enhances the vision encoder by integrating visual knowledge from several vision-specialized agents, using a Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) gating mechanism for flexible and adaptable agent selection.  LAC similarly incorporates textual knowledge from language agents, employing an analogous gating mechanism for optimal combination. Finally, MAC incorporates multi-modal agents (text-to-image and image-to-text models) focusing on aligning visual and textual prompts using a novel score distillation strategy.  All these collaborations are unified through a multi-source knowledge distillation process, leveraging learnable prompts to efficiently transfer knowledge into the CLIP model without fine-tuning the pre-trained agents.  The result is a foundation model with improved generalization performance across diverse downstream visual recognition tasks.", "first_cons": "The method relies heavily on a pre-selected set of 11 heterogeneous agents.
