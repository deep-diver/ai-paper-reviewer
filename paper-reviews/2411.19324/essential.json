Many existing methods either use high-level constraints leading to ambiguous results or neglect temporal correlations resulting in inconsistencies.  This paper introduces a novel approach called Trajectory Attention that addresses these issues. \nTrajectory Attention injects trajectory information directly into the video generation process by using an auxiliary branch alongside traditional temporal attention.  This design enables the two attention mechanisms to work synergistically, resulting in both precise motion control and high-quality content generation. The paper demonstrates significant improvements in precision and long-range consistency on various tasks, including camera motion control for images and videos, and first-frame-guided video editing.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2411.19324/podcast.wav"}
