Bold indicates the best performance. There is a 10.44% performance percentage drop from Full Data to DELIFT after pruning 70% of the data, and a 2.27% performance percentage drop from DELIFT to the next best baseline.", "description": "This table presents the results of the DELIFT model on the MixInstruct dataset for Use Case 1 (Instruction Tuning).  It compares the performance of DELIFT against several baselines: Initial (the model's performance before fine-tuning), Random (randomly selecting a subset of data), SelectIT, LESS, DELIFT (SE) (DELIFT using sentence embeddings instead of the utility-based kernel), and Full Data (using the entire dataset). Performance is measured using three metrics: ICL, QLORA, and ROUGE, along with their sub-metrics (BGE and LAJ).  The bold values indicate the best-performing method for each metric.  Key findings highlighted in the caption are that DELIFT, after pruning 70% of the data, shows only a 10.44% drop in performance from the full dataset and only a 2.27% drop in performance compared to the next-best performing baseline.", "section": "4 Experimental Results"}]
