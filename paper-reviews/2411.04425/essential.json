It selects diverse and optimal data subsets efficiently.", "DELIFT achieves up to 70% reduction in fine-tuning data size without compromising performance, significantly saving computational costs and outperforming existing methods."], "tldr": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is crucial for enhancing their performance but often involves redundant data, increasing computational costs.  Existing methods usually focus on a single optimization stage and can be computationally expensive. This poses a significant challenge for efficient and effective LLM adaptation.  Researchers need an efficient method to select optimal subsets that are useful across all stages of fine-tuning. \nDELIFT addresses these issues by systematically optimizing data selection across all three key stages of fine-tuning using a novel pairwise utility metric.  This metric quantifies how beneficial a data sample is for improving the model's performance on other samples.  **Leveraging submodular functions, DELIFT efficiently selects diverse and optimal data subsets across different fine-tuning stages.**  Experimental results show that DELIFT reduces fine-tuning data size by up to 70% without compromising performance, providing significant computational savings and outperforming existing methods.", "affiliation": "IBM Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
