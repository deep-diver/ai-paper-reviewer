It leverages influence functions to precisely measure the impact of each data point on the student's learning outcome, thereby allowing for a more accurate capture of the student's preferences.  The framework incorporates Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to train the teacher model, enabling it to generate synthetic data specifically designed to align with the student's learning preferences.  The framework consists of three main components: collecting local data influence, constructing a preference dataset, and conducting student-preference-guided teacher optimization. Local data influence is computed using influence functions, measuring the change in the student model's loss before and after training on a single data point. The preference dataset is constructed by pairing instructions with positive and negative influences. Finally, the teacher is optimized using DPO based on the preference dataset, refining its ability to generate influential training data for the student.", "first_cons": "The computational cost of Montessori-Instruct can be higher than traditional methods, due to the multiple iterations of data influence calculation, preference dataset construction, and teacher model optimization.
