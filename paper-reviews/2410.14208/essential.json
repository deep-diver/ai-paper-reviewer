Unlike previous methods that simply use a 'teacher' LLM to generate data for a 'student' LLM, MONTESSORI-INSTRUCT focuses on making the generated data as effective as possible for the student. It does this by first measuring how useful different pieces of synthetic data are to the student's learning, using a technique called 'local data influence.' Then, it uses a method called 'Direct Preference Optimization' to fine-tune the teacher model, making it better at generating helpful training data for the student. Experiments show MONTESSORI-INSTRUCT significantly improves the student's performance compared to other methods.  This approach is particularly valuable because it directly addresses the issue of noisy or unhelpful synthetic data, a common problem in training LLMs."}
