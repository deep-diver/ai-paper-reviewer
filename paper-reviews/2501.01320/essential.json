Patch-based approaches are slow, and attention designs lead to performance degradation when dealing with resolutions different from those used during training.  Diffusion-based models show promise but also face limitations in generation and sampling efficiency.\nSeedVR solves these issues with a novel diffusion transformer architecture using shifted window attention. This design enables efficient processing of arbitrary-length and resolution videos.  The casual video autoencoder further improves training and inference efficiency.  Extensive experiments demonstrate SeedVR's superior performance and speed across various benchmarks, making it a strong baseline for future VR research.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2501.01320/podcast.wav"}
