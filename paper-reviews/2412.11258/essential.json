However, it remains under-explored due to the inherent difficulty in estimating these unseen properties from limited visual information. Existing methods often focus on specific properties or require laborious manual labeling, hindering their applicability to diverse scenarios and scalability.\nThis paper introduces a new method called GaussianProperty. It leverages the power of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and segmentation models to estimate a wider range of physical properties from images, without training. It assigns material properties like density and elasticity to 3D models (represented as Gaussians) reconstructed from multiple views. This enables the model to generate more realistic physical simulations. It also assists robotic grasping by estimating a safe range of force required to lift and hold objects without damage, adapting to the material properties of the object.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.11258/podcast.wav"}
