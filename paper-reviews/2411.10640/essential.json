Existing solutions often struggle with slow speeds and high resource consumption, limiting their practicality for real-time applications.  This is a critical issue because mobile phones offer a seamless platform for integrating MLLMs into everyday tasks. \nThis paper introduces BlueLM-V-3B, which tackles these challenges via a novel co-design strategy.  This involves optimizing the model's architecture for smaller size and faster inference, as well as implementing system optimizations tailored for mobile hardware.  **BlueLM-V-3B achieves a generation speed of 24.4 tokens/s on a MediaTek Dimensity 9300 processor and attains the highest average score among comparable models on the OpenCompass benchmark.**  The results demonstrate a significant step toward making MLLMs more readily available and usable on mobile platforms.", "affiliation": "vivo AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.10640/podcast.wav"}
