It begins by contrasting finite games (with defined rules and endpoints) with infinite games (open-ended and evolving), drawing on James P. Carse's work.  The authors posit that recent advancements in generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models, have made the creation of a truly generative infinite game possible.  They introduce UNBOUNDED as a game of character life simulation, drawing inspiration from sandbox games and tabletop RPGs.

The core gameplay involves character customization, dynamic world creation, open-ended interaction via natural language, and real-time generation (aiming for a refresh rate of approximately one second).  To achieve real-time performance, the system uses Latent Consistency Models (LCMs) for image generation, requiring only two diffusion steps for high-resolution images.  A key innovation is the regional IP-Adapter, which conditions image generation on both the character and environment to maintain consistency across multiple images while mitigating interference between the two elements.  This is accomplished using a dynamic mask generated from cross-attention layers that separates environment and character conditioning.  Block-wise drop in down-sampling layers further enhances consistency.  The game's language model is a distilled specialized LLM, optimized for speed and designed to handle dynamic generation of rules, scenarios, and character responses, trained with data generated by two collaborative LLMs for effective real-time interactivity.  This approach leverages a custom character personalization technique using DreamBooth and arithmetic LoRA merging for maintaining character consistency.", "first_cons": "The reliance on multiple LLMs (initially two, then distilled into one) introduces complexity and potential limitations regarding computational resources, and the potential difficulties in achieving perfect harmonization of these different models.
