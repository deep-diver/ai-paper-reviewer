Unlike typical video games with pre-set rules and endings, UNBOUNDED uses large language models (LLMs) and visual generation models to dynamically create the game world and character interactions.  Players interact with their virtual character using natural language, influencing the story and their character's state (hunger, energy, fun). The system features a new dynamic regional image prompt adapter (IP-Adapter) that ensures consistent and flexible visuals across multiple environments and over time.  The researchers created a specialized, distilled LLM to efficiently generate game mechanics, narratives, and interactions in real-time.  Evaluations showed significant improvements over existing approaches.  UNBOUNDED demonstrates the potential of generative AI to create truly innovative and immersive gaming experiences that break free from traditional game design limitations."}
