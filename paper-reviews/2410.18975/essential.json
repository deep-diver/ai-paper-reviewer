Unlike traditional games with fixed rules and endings, UNBOUNDED uses large language models (LLMs) and image generation models to dynamically create storylines, environments, and character interactions based on player input. Players use natural language to interact with their custom character, guiding its life and actions.  The game features innovative technical components: a specialized LLM that efficiently generates game mechanics and narratives in real-time, and a new dynamic image prompt adapter for consistent visual output across different scenes.  The research shows UNBOUNDED offers significant improvements over traditional methods in character life simulation, user instruction following, and visual quality.  The paper also proposes a method for distilling large language models into smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-time game development.  This work opens up exciting possibilities for future research into AI-driven interactive narratives and game design."}
