{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in document AI and related fields.  It addresses the critical need for **comprehensive benchmarks** in document parsing, offering a **large-scale, diverse dataset** (OmniDocBench) for fair evaluation.  This allows for **objective comparison** of existing and future methods, guiding the development of more robust and generalizable document parsing technologies. The benchmark's flexibility also allows researchers to evaluate individual modules and end-to-end systems across multiple dimensions, fostering innovation.", "summary": "OmniDocBench, a novel benchmark, tackles limitations in current document parsing by introducing a diverse, high-quality dataset with comprehensive annotations, enabling fair multi-level evaluation of modular pipelines and end-to-end methods.", "takeaways": ["OmniDocBench provides a large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset for evaluating document parsing methods.", "The benchmark enables fair comparison of modular pipelines and end-to-end methods across various dimensions.", "Findings reveal limitations of current methods in handling document diversity and highlight the need for more robust and generalizable approaches."], "tldr": "Current document parsing methods struggle with diversity and lack comprehensive evaluation, hindering progress. This paper introduces OmniDocBench, a new benchmark to address these issues.  OmniDocBench features a meticulously curated dataset spanning diverse document types, comprehensive annotations (19 layout categories and 14 attributes), and a flexible evaluation framework allowing multi-level assessments. \nThe comprehensive evaluation using OmniDocBench reveals significant limitations of existing methods, particularly in handling diverse document types. This leads to a fairer evaluation and highlights the need for more robust methods to handle document diversity and fair evaluation standards. OmniDocBench sets a new standard for evaluation and provides crucial insights for future advancements in document parsing technologies.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Document Parsing"}, "podcast_path": "2412.07626/podcast.wav"}
