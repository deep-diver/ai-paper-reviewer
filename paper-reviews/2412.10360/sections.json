[{"heading_title": "Scaling Consistency", "details": {"summary": "Scaling Consistency observes that design choices in moderately sized multimodal models (2-4B parameters) **strongly correlate** with outcomes in much larger models. This offers a crucial advantage by **reducing computational costs** in LMM development, allowing researchers to prototype with smaller models and confidently extrapolate findings to larger ones.  This is particularly relevant because traditional scaling laws, computationally expensive for LLMs, are impractical for multimodal models due to the **integration of multiple pretrained components**. This approach significantly accelerates the exploration of the design space, fostering rapid innovation. Notably, this transferability extends across different model families, highlighting a **robustness** beyond specific architectures. By leveraging Scaling Consistency, researchers gain efficient access to the behavior of large models without incurring the prohibitive costs of training them, accelerating model development and research progress."}}, {"heading_title": "Video-LMM Design", "details": {"summary": "**Video-LMM design** presents complex challenges.  Efficient video sampling is crucial, with **fps sampling outperforming uniform sampling** for capturing temporal dynamics. **Vision encoders significantly impact performance**, where language-supervised models generally outperform self-supervised ones, and combining video and image encoders can enhance both spatial and temporal understanding. Efficient **token resampling, preferably using a Perceiver Resampler**, is vital for handling longer videos, while thoughtful **token integration strategies**, such as inserting timestamps, improve multi-modal processing.  Training procedures also play a key role; **multi-stage training with progressive unfreezing of components** often yields performance gains. Finally, **data composition is crucial**, balancing text, image, and video data effectively."}}, {"heading_title": "ApolloBench", "details": {"summary": "**ApolloBench**, a curated video-LMM benchmark, addresses **evaluation inefficiencies** and biases in existing benchmarks. Many current video benchmarks are **redundant** and rely heavily on **text comprehension** rather than video understanding, as models often perform well with only text or single-frame inputs. ApolloBench prioritizes **video perception** by filtering out questions solvable without video and focusing on temporal reasoning categories like OCR and egocentric understanding. This makes ApolloBench **41x faster** than existing benchmarks while remaining highly correlated with them, offering a **more efficient and accurate** evaluation of video-LMM performance."}}, {"heading_title": "The Apollo Models", "details": {"summary": "The Apollo models represent a **significant advancement in video-LMMs**, demonstrating **state-of-the-art performance** across various benchmarks and model sizes.  A key strength lies in their efficiency, often outperforming much larger models. This is achieved through several key design choices validated by extensive experimentation. **FPS sampling**, critical for capturing temporal dynamics in videos, is prioritized. **SigLIP and InternVideo2 encoders**, a powerful combination for visual representation, excel at capturing both spatial and temporal information.  The use of a **Perceiver Resampler** optimizes token handling, maximizing efficiency and performance. **Multi-stage training**, another defining feature, progressively refines the model's understanding of video content. The data composition during training further enhances this understanding. Notably, Apollo-3B excels, surpassing many 7B models, while Apollo-7B sets a new standard for 7B models, rivaling even larger 30B models.
