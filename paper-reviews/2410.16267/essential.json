Unlike previous models that used thousands of visual tokens to describe a video, BLIP-3-Video cleverly uses a 'temporal encoder' to represent a video using only 32 tokens.  This drastically reduces computation while maintaining or improving accuracy in tasks like answering questions about videos.  Experiments show it performs similarly to much larger models, highlighting its efficiency.  Different types of temporal encoders were explored, with attentional pooling showing the best results. The model was trained in stages, starting with image captioning, then video captioning, and finally video question answering using multiple datasets. The result is a compact and accurate model ideal for handling videos efficiently."}
