The input video is processed at a resolution of 384x384, using a SigLIP encoder to initially map each frame into 729 tokens with a channel size of 1152.  Perceiver-Resampler is employed to further reduce the number of tokens per frame. The choice of 16 to 128 tokens as final video representation is based on the experiments.  A MLP-based TokenLearner, designed for spatio-temporal attentional pooling or sequential model, is used as the temporal encoder. The model also utilizes the grouped TTM (Token Turing Machines) architecture for efficient sequential modeling of the temporal information, maintaining a memory of size N*4=512 tokens. The final 16-128 video tokens are then mapped to text embeddings with a channel dimension of 3072 before being fed to the Phi-3 large language model for output generation.\n\n## Public Benchmark Results\n\nThe model's performance was extensively evaluated using multiple public datasets, encompassing both open-ended question-answering tasks (MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, ActivityNet-QA, TGIF-QA) and multiple-choice question-answering tasks (NExT-QA).  Results showed that BLIP-3-Video achieved accuracies comparable to or better than significantly larger state-of-the-art models, even with a much smaller model size (4B parameters compared to others with 7B or 34B).  A key finding highlighted the effectiveness of using only 32 visual tokens to represent the entire video, showing superior or comparable results to those that used considerably more tokens (e.g., 4608 tokens). The number of visual tokens was a crucial factor in determining model performance and efficiency. The superior performance highlights the effectiveness of the newly designed temporal encoder, capable of extracting sufficient and essential information using relatively few tokens.\n\n## Ablation Studies\n\nAblation studies compared different temporal encoders, including a baseline single-frame model, simple mean pooling, a transformer-based encoder similar to Mirasol3B, and the novel Token Turing Machines.  Results suggested that the learnable spatio-temporal attentional pooling (TokenLearner) and the sequential model using TTM outperformed the simpler methods.  Further ablation studies explored different pooling strategies for reducing the number of tokens (e.g., from 1024 to 32), showcasing the advantages of the spatio-temporal attentional pooling and sequential models.  These experiments emphasized the contribution of the novel temporal encoder in significantly reducing the computational cost without sacrificing accuracy.  Speed improvements were observed in sample processing per GPU; without a temporal encoder, the speed was 3.3 samples/sec/GPU, while 16/32/128 tokens using the temporal encoder achieved 8.5/8.2/7.5 samples/sec/GPU, respectively.\n\n## Video Captioning Evaluation\n\nFinally, the model underwent evaluation on video captioning tasks using the MSVD-Caption, MSRVTT-Caption, and a custom subset from the Mira dataset. BLIP-3-Video consistently outperformed competing models, such as LLaVA-OneVision-7B and Tarsier-7B, generating high-quality captions and demonstrating the versatility of its architecture. The captioning only model, a 4B parameter model trained solely on Mira video caption data, was also included in the evaluation, with results showcasing the model's efficacy in this specific task.  Overall, these results reinforced the model's ability to capture comprehensive information in a computationally efficient manner.", "first_cons": "The ablation study could have included a wider range of temporal encoder architectures for a more thorough comparison.", "first_pros": "The experiments comprehensively evaluated BLIP-3-Video's performance on various benchmark datasets, including both question-answering and video captioning tasks.", "keypoints": ["BLIP-3-Video achieves comparable or better accuracy than much larger models (4B vs 7B or 34B parameters)", "Using only 32 visual tokens to represent a video yields strong results.", "Significant speed improvements are shown (3.3 samples/sec/GPU without temporal encoder vs 8.5/8.2/7.5 with temporal encoder)", "Superior performance on video captioning tasks is demonstrated"], "second_cons": "The paper focuses heavily on quantitative results; a more in-depth qualitative analysis of the generated captions would enhance the impact of the findings.", "second_pros": "The study's ablation experiments clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed temporal encoder and the efficiency gains achieved by reducing the number of tokens.", "summary": "This section presents a comprehensive evaluation of the BLIP-3-Video model on various video understanding tasks. The model demonstrates comparable or superior performance to significantly larger models, achieving this with a significantly smaller parameter count (4B) and a drastically reduced number of visual tokens (as few as 32) thanks to a novel temporal encoder. Ablation studies highlight the advantages of using learnable spatio-temporal attentional pooling and sequential models over simpler alternatives, further supporting the model's efficiency.  Results from video captioning evaluations also showcase the high quality of the generated captions."}}, {"page_end_idx": 9, "page_start_idx": 8, "section_number": 4, "section_title": "RELATED WORKS", "details": {"details": "This section, \"RELATED WORKS,\" provides a review of existing literature on image-text LLMs and video LLMs, highlighting their common architectures and strategies.
