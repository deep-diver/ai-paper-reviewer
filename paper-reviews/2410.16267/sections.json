Existing approaches either use simple spatial/temporal pooling, employ separate video encoders, or aggregate all frame-level tokens, resulting in a massive number of tokens (thousands for just 8 frames).  This large token count hinders efficiency, as LLM computation scales quadratically with the number of tokens. The high computational cost associated with processing videos is a major bottleneck for scaling these models to longer videos.

The input video (384x384 resolution) is processed using a SigLIP encoder, which maps each frame into 729 tokens with a channel size of 1152. A Perceiver-Resampler further reduces these tokens to 128, which are then fed into the temporal encoder.  Two types of temporal encoders were explored: TokenLearner (spatio-temporal attentional pooling) and Token Turing Machines (sequential model). The output of the temporal encoder, consisting of 16 to 128 tokens, is combined with text embeddings before being passed to the Phi-3 LLM for final text generation.\n\n## Public Benchmark Results\n\nBLIP-3-Video was evaluated on several public video question-answering datasets, including MSVD-QA, MSRVTT-QA, ActivityNet-QA, and TGIF-QA. The results demonstrate that despite its significantly smaller size (4B parameters) compared to state-of-the-art models (7B and 34B parameters), BLIP-3-Video achieves comparable or even superior accuracy using far fewer visual tokens (32 vs. 4608).  The superior results are attributed to the effectiveness of the temporal encoder.  A smaller scale experiment is also conducted on a multiple-choice question-answering dataset, NExT-QA, showing similar competitive results.\n\n## Ablation Studies\n\nAblation studies were performed to compare different temporal encoders: a baseline single-frame model, mean pooling, a transformer-based encoder, vanilla Token Turing Machines, and the proposed spatio-temporal attentional pooling and sequential model implementations.  Results indicate that the learnable spatio-temporal attentional pooling method offers significant advantages over simpler non-learnable pooling methods in terms of video QA accuracy.
