Existing methods use separate latent spaces, reducing efficiency. They often rely on intricate networks to ensure the geometric and rotational invariance that is required. Moreover, prior works overlooked the reconstruction error, leading to stability issues in generated molecules. This leads to models being complex while at the same time not very accurate.\n\nTo solve these challenges, the authors propose **Unified Variational Auto-Encoder for 3D Molecular Latent Diffusion Modeling (UAE-3D)**. UAE-3D compresses 3D molecules into a unified latent space, ensuring near-zero reconstruction error and employing SE(3) augmentations to ensure equivariance without complex baked-in designs. The model integrates modalities through a Relational Transformer and uses a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) for latent generation. This unified approach allows the model to outperform previous methods. The experiments done in GEOM-Drugs and QM9 datasets demonstrates that UAE-3D sets new benchmarks in efficiency and quality for both de novo and conditional generation of 3D molecules.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15567/podcast.wav"}
