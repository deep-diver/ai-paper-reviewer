The response length experiences a sudden decrease at specific steps across all three datasets and then fluctuates.", "description": "This figure visualizes the changes in the length of model responses generated during the fine-tuning process of three different datasets: StanfordCars, SUN397, and DescribableTextures.  The x-axis represents the number of fine-tuning steps, while the y-axis shows the response length.  The plot reveals that the response length is not consistently decreasing but instead undergoes sudden drops at certain points, followed by periods of fluctuation. This indicates that the model's reasoning or 'thinking' process isn't linear during fine-tuning but instead involves abrupt shifts in its approach to the problem.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
