Existing large models require significant computational resources, limiting accessibility. Researchers are exploring smaller, efficient models, but creating them requires careful data selection and training. The current methods often fall short in achieving robust performance, particularly in tasks like math problem-solving.\n\nTo solve this, the paper introduces **Light-R1**, a series of models trained using a curriculum-based approach. This involves multiple stages of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), followed by Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). The researchers show that this method allows them to train high-performing models from scratch, using smaller base models and less computational power. They also highlight the importance of a carefully curated dataset, demonstrating that a small, high-quality dataset can significantly improve the performance of various models.", "affiliation": "Qiyuan Tech", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10460/podcast.wav"}
