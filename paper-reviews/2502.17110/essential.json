Manually written knowledge is labor-intensive and inefficient. To address this, a new framework is needed for seamlessly automating tasks. By improving knowledge acquisition, the researchers hope to enhance how devices respond to their owners. \n\nTo tackle these issues, Mobile-Agent-V is introduced, a framework leveraging video guidance for rich and cost-effective operational knowledge. It enhances task execution by using video inputs without specialized sampling or preprocessing. A sliding window strategy and agents ensure actions align with user instructions. Mobile-Agent-V demonstrates a 30% performance improvement over existing methods.", "affiliation": "Beijing Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.17110/podcast.wav"}
