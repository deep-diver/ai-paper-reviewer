[{"content": "| Engagement | Definition | Examples |\n|---|---|---|\n| Passive Engagement (\u00a75.1) | No direct user interaction during the generation process leverages only user profile and preferences | - immersive news writing (Oh et al., 2020)<br>- personalized curated sports articles (Kim & Lee, 2019)<br>- AI-generated user engagement metrics (Gatti et al., 2014) |\n| Deterministic Engagement (\u00a75.2) | Similar to passive, though user provides basic instructions to the genAI model to start or stop the generative process. | - AI generated hierarchical tutorials (Truong et al., 2021)<br>- automated newsgathering (Nishal & Diakopoulos, 2024)<br>- chemical synthesis (Truong et al., 2021) |\n| Assistive Engagement (\u00a75.3) | Offers indirect assistance to users such as making suggestions. Systems using assistive engagement must understand the user intentions and high-level goals. | - follow-up question generation (Valencia et al., 2023b)<br>- autocompletion (Jakesch et al., 2023)<br>- writing suggestions (Fitria, 2021) |\n| Turn-based Collaborative Engagement (\u00a75.4) | The generative process between the user and generative model occurs in a sequential fashion (i.e., turn-based) | Turn-based conversational interfaces where the user makes a request, then AI generates content, and the process repeats in a turn-based fashion. |\n| Simultaneous Collaborative Engagement (\u00a75.5) | User and GenAI work together in parallel to generate the final content | A drawing system where user and generative AI draw concurrently in real-time (Lawton et al., 2023) |", "caption": "Table 1: Taxonomy of Human-GenAI Engagement.\nWe summarize the main categories of human-GenAI engagement and provide intuitive definitions and examples of each.", "description": "This table categorizes different levels of interaction between humans and generative AI systems. It defines five key engagement levels: Passive, Deterministic, Assistive, Turn-based Collaborative, and Simultaneous Collaborative.  Each level is described with a definition that explains the nature of the human-AI interaction and provides specific examples of AI applications that fall under that category. This provides a comprehensive overview of the spectrum of human-AI collaboration possibilities in the context of generative AI.", "section": "5 Human-AI Engagement Taxonomy: From Passive to Collaborative"}]
