Existing methods rely on 3D diffusion, yet they sometimes make invalid molecules and don't use big 1D molecule datasets. To solve this, we can use language models, which are guaranteed validity. How do we bring 1D language advantages to 3D generation? It's tough, as previous methods lack effective language models, powerful 3D models, or efficient transfer learning. \n\nNExT-Mol, tackles this by combining 1D language models with 3D diffusion. We pretrain a large language model on molecules, then predict 3D shapes using a diffusion model. Key innovations include scaling up the language model and refining the diffusion model. This makes sure validity, is scalable, and accurate. By leveraging pretrained language, NExT-Mol **demonstrates strong performance** in molecule generation and conformer prediction.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.12638/podcast.wav"}
