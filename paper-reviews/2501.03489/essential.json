Private inference (PI) is a promising solution, but it struggles with high communication and latency overheads, mostly due to nonlinear operations within transformer architectures. These nonlinearities are crucial for model stability and attention head diversity, and removing them leads to training instability and underutilization of attention's representational capacity. \nThis paper proposes solutions to overcome these issues. It introduces an entropy-guided attention mechanism along with a novel entropy regularization technique. The approach dynamically adjusts regularization strength for individual attention heads and mitigates 'entropic overload'. Additionally, PI-friendly layer normalization alternatives prevent 'entropy collapse' and improve training stability in LLMs with fewer nonlinearities. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate significant improvements in both efficiency and model performance. The paper offers a principled framework for designing efficient and private LLMs, advancing the field of privacy-preserving AI.", "affiliation": "New York University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.03489/podcast.wav"}
