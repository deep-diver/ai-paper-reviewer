Current methods are limited by sparse knowledge. Meanwhile, 3D vision-language models(VLMs) have rich knowledge, but also noisy. Therefore, it is important to improve the performance of models in novel class generalization for real world usage.\n\nThis paper introduces a new framework named GFS-VL, to address these issues. It incorporates 3 new methods, including a pseudo-label selection to filter noisy data, adaptive infilling approach to enrich regions, and a novel-base mix strategy to embed few-shot samples into scenes. The work also introduces 2 challenging benchmarks. Experiments show the effectiveness of the framework.", "affiliation": "University of Copenhagen", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16282/podcast.wav"}
