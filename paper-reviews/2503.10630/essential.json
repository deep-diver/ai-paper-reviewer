These methods typically rely on large language models (LLMs) but differ significantly in their overall pipeline, resulting in a lack of versatility. To address this, the paper introduces a general framework for universal zero-shot goal-oriented navigation. \n\nThe proposed **UniGoal** framework uses a uniform graph representation to unify different goals and converts agent observations into an online maintained scene graph. It leverages LLMs for explicit graph-based reasoning and employs a multi-stage scene exploration policy based on graph matching between the scene and goal graphs. Experiments demonstrate that UniGoal achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on multiple navigation tasks with a single model.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10630/podcast.wav"}
