First, a diverse dataset of 350 unstructured PDF documents from six real-world domains is collected. Human experts then extract ground truth structured data, which is then used to generate question-answer pairs (Q&As) based on the multimodal elements within the documents (text, tables, formulas). Second, two knowledge bases are created using this ground truth data: one containing OCR-processed structured data for evaluating existing OCR systems, and another with perturbed data simulating various levels of OCR noise (semantic and formatting) to test the effects of these inaccuracies. Finally, the impact of OCR noise on each component (retrieval, generation, and overall system performance) is systematically evaluated using these knowledge bases and the generated Q&As.", "section": "3.
