This paper introduces Moto, a novel approach that leverages abundant unlabeled video data to overcome these limitations. **The core idea is to use latent motion tokens as a bridging \"language\" to represent motion information in videos**, enabling unsupervised pre-training and efficient transfer learning. \n\nMoto employs a two-stage training process. First, a latent motion tokenizer converts video data into latent motion tokens, capturing the essence of visual motion. Second, a generative model, Moto-GPT, is pre-trained to predict the next motion token autoregressively. This pre-training phase allows Moto-GPT to learn rich motion priors from videos. Finally, a co-fine-tuning strategy is used to seamlessly transfer these learned motion priors to real robot actions.  **The results demonstrate that Moto achieves superior performance in robot manipulation tasks compared to existing methods, especially with limited training data.**", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2412.04445/podcast.wav"}
