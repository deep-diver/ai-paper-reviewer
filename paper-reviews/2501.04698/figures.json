The single-concept approach fails to effectively handle multiple concepts, leading to inconsistent or inaccurate video generation.  The naive combined approach, although using multiple concepts, does not produce satisfactory results because the combination method does not effectively address the challenge of identity decoupling and concept conflation which are common issues within MCVC.", "section": "1.

It illustrates the process of multi-concept video customization, starting from user-provided text captions and multiple reference images. The framework incorporates visual and textual embeddings, leveraging a decouple attention module (DAM) to integrate these, and employs a multi-concept injector for seamless integration into the diffusion model.  The output is a high-quality customized video that accurately reflects the specified concepts.", "section": "4. ConceptMaster"}]
