Existing methods either involve time-consuming test-time tuning or fail to effectively decouple concepts.  This leads to suboptimal results. \nConceptMaster tackles this challenge using a novel, efficient approach. It learns decoupled multi-concept embeddings, injecting them into diffusion models without altering the original structure.  A new data collection pipeline facilitates creating a large, high-quality MCVC dataset.  Extensive experiments using a new benchmark demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods in concept fidelity, identity decoupling, and overall video quality.  **This efficient, data-driven approach significantly advances the field of video personalization.**", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2501.04698/podcast.wav"}
