It highlights the unification of adaptation pipelines, showing how heterogeneous MedVLP model architectures (ResNet, ViT, Swin) are integrated with task-specific heads (linear classifier, UperNet, R2Gen) for consistent evaluation. This addresses the challenge of incompatible model architectures in existing MedVLP methods.", "section": "3.3 Unifying Task Adaptation Pipelines"}]
