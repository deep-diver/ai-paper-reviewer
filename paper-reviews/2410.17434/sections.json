However, it emphasizes a critical limitation: the inability of current MLLMs to effectively process long videos due to their limited context size.  The context size is a crucial factor, as advanced MLLMs require hundreds of tokens to represent a single image.  For instance, LLaVA-1.6 uses 576-2880 tokens per image, and LLaVA-OneVision uses 7290.  An hour-long video, even with reduced frame rate, could easily require over 200k tokens, far exceeding the typical 8k context length limit of most MLLMs. This constraint necessitates compromises, typically uniform sampling of a limited number of frames, which leads to a significant loss of visual information and hinders comprehensive video understanding.  The section sets the stage for the introduction of LongVU, a novel method aimed at addressing this limitation of long video processing.\n\n## Existing Approaches and Their Shortcomings\n\nExisting methods for handling long videos often rely on uniform sampling of frames, selecting a fixed number of frames from the video regardless of content variation. This naive approach leads to overlooking crucial information present in visually dense or dynamic sections of the video and introduces significant information loss.  Other methods, while trying to preserve more frames, are computationally intensive or employ resampling techniques that reduce the quantity of visual information. These methods aim to decrease the number of visual tokens, but at the expense of losing essential visual detail. The introduction clearly points out the lack of solutions that adeptly manage both token count and information preservation in long video processing.\n\n## The Need for Adaptive Compression\n\nThe introduction convincingly argues that a more sophisticated approach to handling long videos is needed \u2013 one that goes beyond simple uniform sampling. The challenge lies in finding a method that can significantly reduce the number of tokens while minimizing the loss of critical visual details. This necessitates an adaptive compression mechanism that intelligently selects which parts of the video are most important to retain, ensuring a balance between computational feasibility and information preservation.  This problem forms the core motivation for the research presented in the paper, directly leading into the description of their proposed solution, LongVU.", "first_cons": "The introduction focuses heavily on the problem without offering a glimpse of the solution other than mentioning its name.

It begins by tracing the evolution of VLMs from early contrastive learning approaches like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023), which focused on aligning visual and textual embeddings.  The integration of LLMs significantly advanced VLMs, leading to models like Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022) and BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023a), employing cross-attention mechanisms for better multimodal understanding.  Further developments have extended VLMs to a wider array of tasks, encompassing spatial perception and diverse multi-modal applications.  The discussion emphasizes the use of sophisticated optimization techniques and large datasets to improve performance across various vision-language tasks.\n\nThe second part of the section focuses on Video LLMs, emphasizing the challenges in processing long videos within the context limitations of LLMs.  It critiques methods that employ uniform sampling or aggressive resampling to reduce the number of frames or tokens, pointing out the considerable loss of visual information that these approaches introduce. Several existing Video LLMs are mentioned,  highlighting their different strategies for handling video data, such as Q-former modules for merging visual and textual features, frame concatenation, and employing memory modules to capture long-range temporal context or clip segmentation. The section contrasts vision-language contrastive methods with self-supervised methods, highlighting the benefits of self-supervised approaches, such as DINOv2, for capturing subtle frame differences and low-level visual details.\n\nFinally, the section touches upon video token compression techniques, emphasizing approaches that dynamically adjust the token representation of images or video frames to manage the computational demands of processing extensive video data.  This includes exploring methods that leverage dynamic image tokens within the Transformer architecture, merging tokens across frames based on similarity, or employing spatial pooling to reduce dimensionality.

First, a temporal reduction strategy leverages DINOv2 features to identify and remove redundant frames exhibiting high similarity, reducing the video sequence length approximately by half. Second, a selective feature reduction via cross-modal query is applied.  This step utilizes text queries to guide the selection of frames to preserve at full token resolution, while applying spatial pooling to reduce the resolution of other frames.  The number of frames to maintain at full resolution is dynamically determined based on the given context length and the cross-modal attention scores (Equation 1). Finally, if the number of tokens still exceeds the context length, a spatial token reduction mechanism based on temporal dependencies is performed.  This involves partitioning the frames into non-overlapping windows and comparing the spatial tokens of subsequent frames to the first frame in each window. Spatial tokens with a cosine similarity exceeding a threshold (\u03b8 = 0.8) are pruned (Equation 2), effectively compressing the spatial information of redundant frames. The method aims to achieve effective compression while preserving essential visual information and long-range temporal context.  The entire process is illustrated in Figure 2, visually depicting the flow of operations within the architecture of LongVU.", "first_cons": "The effectiveness of LongVU relies heavily on the performance of DINOv2 for temporal reduction and the selection of the threshold for cosine similarity in the spatial token compression.

VideoMME and MLVU are long video benchmarks for assessing long-video understanding capability.  Evaluation used greedy decoding (num_beams=1).\n- Implementation Details:  The implementation used SigLIP and DINOv2 as vision encoders and Qwen2-7B or Llama3.2-3B as language models. AdamW optimizer with cosine scheduler was employed. The training included an image-language pre-training stage and a video-language finetuning stage.  A significant hyperparameter is the sliding window size K=8 for spatial token compression.\n- Video Understanding: The quantitative results (Table 1) show that LongVU significantly outperformed several recent open-source video LLMs (e.g., VideoChat2, LLaVA-OneVision) across benchmarks. The largest gains were on VideoMME Long subset, where it surpassed LLaVA-OneVision by 12.8%.
