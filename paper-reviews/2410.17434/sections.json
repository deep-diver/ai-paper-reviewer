However, processing long videos presents a significant challenge due to the limited context window of LLMs, typically restricted to 8k tokens.  This constraint severely limits the amount of video information that can be processed, as a single image often requires hundreds of tokens, and an hour-long video would necessitate hundreds of thousands of tokens.  Existing methods often address this limitation by uniformly sampling a fixed number of video frames, which leads to a loss of crucial visual information due to the inherent non-uniform nature of video content.

It then highlights the advancement brought by LLMs, leading to models like Kosmos-1 (Huang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2023), Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023a), MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023), and LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024c), all showcasing different approaches to integrating visual and linguistic features.  The evolution shows a trend of simpler integration methods, moving from complex cross-attention mechanisms to more straightforward projection of visual features into the LLM embedding space.\n\nThe discussion then expands to broader applications of VLMs in multi-modal tasks and the development of unified models capable of handling diverse vision-language tasks.  Models like Cambrian (Tong et al., 2024) are highlighted for their use of multiple vision encoders and sophisticated techniques to improve performance.  A key finding from Cambrian is that SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) proves to be a strong language-supervised model, while DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) excels in vision-centric tasks. This sets the stage for the following section on Video Large Language Models (VLLMs).\n\n## Video Large Language Models\n\nThis subsection discusses the challenges and approaches in applying LLMs to video understanding.  A central theme is the constraint of context length in LLMs, and how that limits the amount of video data that can be processed.  Many existing methods use uniform sampling of video frames, which often leads to loss of crucial visual information. The approaches discussed include employing pooling modules to reduce data dimensions, using Q-Former modules to merge visual and text features, concatenating frame features, or segmenting long videos into smaller, more manageable chunks.  These methods generally highlight trade-offs between the number of tokens per frame and the number of frames used.  The authors highlight a limitation of many approaches: uniform sampling of video frames, leading to a significant loss of important visual information.\n\n## Video Token Compression\n\nThis section focuses on methods employed to compress video tokens to fit within the limited context lengths of LLMs.  Techniques like dynamic image tokens, video token compression, and methods that use K-nearest neighbor tokens or spatial pooling to reduce dimensionality are mentioned. The authors highlight the work of Chat-UniVi (Jin et al., 2023) and SlowFast-LLaVA (Xu et al., 2024), which both employ strategies to compress the input video to fit within the capabilities of the LLMs.  The discussion further suggests that the existing methods, which often involve uniform sampling or naive token compression, lack adaptability to non-uniform content within the video.\n", "first_cons": "The review of existing vision-language and video-language models is somewhat broad and lacks detailed comparisons between the various architectures and their respective performance metrics, making it difficult to fully assess the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach.", "first_pros": "The section provides a good overview of the evolution of vision-language models (VLMs) and video-language models (VLLMs), highlighting key advancements and challenges in the field.", "keypoints": ["Early VLMs like CLIP relied on contrastive loss, while later models integrated LLMs for improved performance.", "LLMs' context size limitations pose a significant challenge for processing long videos; uniform sampling methods are insufficient.", "Several approaches to addressing the context length issue are reviewed, including pooling, Q-Former modules, concatenation, and video segmentation.", "Video token compression techniques like dynamic tokens and spatial pooling have been explored, but often suffer from information loss.", "The superior performance of SigLIP for language-supervised tasks and DINOv2 for vision-centric tasks is noted."], "second_cons": "The section primarily focuses on summarizing existing work and does not propose any novel methods or frameworks, limiting its contribution to the advancement of the field.", "second_pros": "The organization of the section is clear and logical, progressing from fundamental VLMs to more specialized VLLMs and their associated token compression techniques.

First, a temporal reduction step leverages DINOv2 features to identify and remove redundant frames exhibiting high similarity, roughly halving the number of frames. Second, a selective feature reduction is performed using a text-guided cross-modal query.  This step selectively preserves the full token resolution for frames relevant to the text query, while applying spatial pooling to reduce the remaining frames to a lower resolution. The number of frames maintained at full resolution is dynamically determined based on the available context length (e.g., 8k tokens for LLMs) and the length of the text query, aiming to balance detail preservation with token limits. Finally, a spatial token reduction mechanism, based on inter-frame temporal dependencies, further reduces the number of tokens per frame if necessary, reducing average tokens to 2 per frame for hour-long videos.  This is achieved by using a sliding window approach (size K=8), comparing spatial tokens within the window to the first frame\u2019s tokens, and removing redundant ones based on a cosine similarity threshold (\u03b8 = 0.8). The method aims to preserve visual information while reducing the number of tokens needed to represent a long video, making processing feasible for LLMs with limited context lengths.", "first_cons": "The method's reliance on pre-trained models (DINOv2 and SigLIP) means its performance is inherently dependent on the quality and characteristics of these models.
