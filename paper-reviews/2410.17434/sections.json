Current advanced MLLMs represent a single image using a substantial number of tokens (e.g., 576-2,880 tokens per image in LLaVA-1.6 and 7,290 tokens in LLaVA-OneVision).  Processing an hour-long video, which could require over 200,000 tokens, is computationally infeasible given typical context length limits (around 8k tokens) for current MLLMs. Existing methods address this by uniformly sampling a fixed number of frames, but this approach overlooks the non-uniform content distribution within videos, resulting in the loss of crucial visual information.\n\n## The Need for Adaptive Compression\n\nThe core problem is the tension between the immense amount of data in long videos and the limited context window of LLMs.  Trying to simply include all frames leads to token truncation and information loss.  Uniform sampling methods are inefficient because they ignore the fact that some frames are more important than others. This necessitates an adaptive compression strategy that intelligently reduces the number of video tokens while preserving essential visual details.\n\n## The Promise of LongVU\n\nThe introduction sets the stage for the paper's proposed solution, LongVU, a novel spatiotemporal adaptive compression mechanism.  This approach will address the limitations of existing techniques by leveraging cross-modal queries and inter-frame dependencies to adaptively reduce both temporal and spatial redundancy in videos.  By dynamically adapting to the visual content, LongVU aims to efficiently process and understand long videos within the constrained context length of current LLMs, outperforming existing methods which are based on simple uniform sampling or intensive resampling.", "first_cons": "Existing methods for processing long videos with LLMs, such as uniform frame sampling, are inefficient and lead to information loss because they don't consider the varied importance of different frames.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly and concisely identifies a significant, unsolved problem in the field of video understanding with LLMs: processing hour-long videos within the context limitations of current models.", "keypoints": ["Current advanced MLLMs use hundreds to thousands of tokens per image (576-2,880 tokens in LLaVA-1.6, 7,290 tokens in LLaVA-OneVision).", "An hour-long video could require over 200,000 tokens, exceeding the capacity of current LLMs (typically 8k tokens).", "Existing methods use uniform frame sampling, losing crucial visual information by ignoring content variation.", "The proposed solution, LongVU, will use a spatiotemporal adaptive compression mechanism."], "second_cons": "The introduction only briefly mentions the proposed solution (LongVU) without providing any details about its specific mechanisms or methodology.

While advanced LLMs can effectively analyze short videos, they struggle with hour-long videos due to their limited context length and the massive number of tokens required to represent such content. Existing methods like uniform sampling of frames are shown to be insufficient, as they disregard the uneven distribution of important information across long videos. The paper introduces LongVU, a proposed solution employing a novel spatiotemporal adaptive compression technique to address this limitation and achieve enhanced video understanding performance."}}, {"page_end_idx": 3, "page_start_idx": 2, "section_number": 2, "section_title": "Related Work", "details": {"details": "- **Vision Language Models:** The section begins by discussing the evolution of Vision Language Models (VLMs), starting with contrastive learning methods like CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023), which project visual and language embeddings into a shared space.  It then highlights the advancements brought about by Large Language Models (LLMs), leading to the development of more integrated models like Flamingo (Alayrac et al., 2022), BLIP-2 (Li et al., 2023a), MiniGPT-4 (Zhu et al., 2023), and LLaVA (Liu et al., 2024c).  These models use various techniques, such as cross-attention and Q-Formers, to merge visual and linguistic features.  The section also notes the expansion of VLMs into broader multi-modal tasks and the efforts to create more unified models capable of handling diverse tasks.\n\n- **Video Large Language Models:** This section focuses on the application of LLMs to video understanding. It points out the challenges posed by the length of videos and the limited context window of LLMs, typically around 8k tokens.  Several approaches are described, including merging visual and text features using Q-Former modules (Li et al., 2023c, 2024b; Cheng et al., 2024), concatenating frame features (Lin et al., 2023; Luo et al., 2023; Ataallah et al., 2024a), and employing techniques like pooling to reduce dimensionality (Maaz et al., 2023b). The section also discusses methods that try to preserve as many frames as possible by segmenting videos (Ataallah et al., 2024b) or using memory modules to handle longer sequences (Song et al., 2023; Ren et al., 2023b).\n\n- **Video Token Compression:** The final part discusses different approaches to compress video tokens for more efficient processing.  This involves exploring the use of dynamic image tokens (Ma et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2022; Bolya et al., 2022) or video tokens (Lee et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2023a; Choi et al., 2024) within the Transformer framework. It mentions specific techniques like merging K-nearest neighbor tokens (Jin et al., 2023) or using spatial pooling to reduce the number of tokens (Xu et al., 2024).

First, a temporal reduction strategy leverages DINOv2 features to identify and remove redundant frames exhibiting high similarity, reducing the video's temporal length approximately by half. Second, selective feature reduction utilizes a text-guided cross-modal query mechanism.  This mechanism prioritizes preserving full tokens for frames deemed relevant to the text query, while applying spatial pooling to reduce the token resolution of less relevant frames. This step aims to balance detail preservation with context length limitations. Finally, spatial token compression further reduces the number of tokens based on temporal dependencies, particularly useful for very long videos. This involves partitioning the video into non-overlapping windows and comparing the spatial tokens of frames within each window to a reference frame (typically, the first frame in the window).  Tokens with high similarity are pruned, reducing redundancy.  The overall goal is to significantly reduce the token count while maintaining key visual and temporal information within the context length constraints of the LLM, enabling processing of hour-long videos.", "first_cons": "The method's effectiveness relies heavily on the quality of DINOv2 features and the cross-modal query mechanism.
