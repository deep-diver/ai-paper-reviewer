Uniform sampling overlooks critical frames due to its sparse nature. Dense sampling may surpass the maximum context length, leading to truncation of tokens from targeted frames. In contrast, our method can adaptively conduct spatiotemporal compression, accommodating long video sequences while preserving more visual details.", "description": "The chart compares LongVU's adaptive spatiotemporal compression method to uniform and dense sampling for processing long videos, highlighting its ability to preserve visual details within context length limits.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "2410.17434/charts/charts_10_0.png", "caption": "Figure 4 We randomly sample hundreds of videos to demonstrate the frames/tokens level reduction rate.
