It does this through a three-step adaptive compression process. First, it leverages DINOv2 features to identify and remove redundant frames.  Second, it uses text-guided cross-modal queries to selectively reduce visual tokens, keeping important details while reducing less relevant information. Finally, it employs a spatial token reduction method based on temporal dependencies for further compression. This approach allows LongVU to significantly compress videos without losing crucial visual information, enabling efficient processing of long videos in LLMs.  Benchmarks show that LongVU outperforms existing methods in various video understanding tasks, especially on hour-long videos, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in handling long-form video data.  The research also highlights LongVU's scalability, showing it performs well even with smaller and less resource-intensive LLMs."}
