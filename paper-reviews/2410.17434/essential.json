It cleverly reduces the number of video tokens needed by focusing on removing redundant information both across time (temporal redundancy) and within individual frames (spatial redundancy). This is achieved through a three-step process: 1) Removing redundant frames using visual similarity features. 2) Selectively reducing the number of visual tokens based on their relevance to the text query, keeping important details. 3) Further reducing the number of visual tokens in long videos based on their temporal relationships.  The results show LongVU significantly outperforms current approaches on various video understanding benchmarks, particularly for hour-long videos. Importantly, even with a lightweight LLM, it delivers state-of-the-art results, making it a highly efficient and effective solution."}
