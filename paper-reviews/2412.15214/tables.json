The metrics used for comparison include the Frechet Inception Distance (FID), which measures the quality of generated images; the Frechet Video Distance (FVD), which assesses the quality of generated videos; and the Object Motion Consistency (ObjMC), which evaluates how well the generated object motions match the predefined trajectories.  The comparison includes the results from three different methods: DragAnything [47], DragNUWA 1.5 [53], and the authors' proposed LeviTor model, both under settings with single and multiple control points. The results show that the LeviTor method outperforms other approaches in terms of FID and FVD, indicating superior image and video quality.", "section": "4.
