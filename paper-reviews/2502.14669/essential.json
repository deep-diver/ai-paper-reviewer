Current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are good at recognizing patterns and objects, but have problems with deeper spatial thinking and planning. It's a big step toward more flexible AI to close this gap and give LLMs strong visual thinking skills.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces **AlphaMaze**, a new two-stage training method to give standard LLMs visual reasoning skills for maze navigation. The method uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on tokenized mazes to teach movement commands, followed by Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a special reward function to improve decision-making. The new **MazeBench** is introduced to evaluate maze-solving ability, while the experiments show big accuracy gains through GRPO.", "affiliation": "Menlo Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14669/podcast.wav"}
