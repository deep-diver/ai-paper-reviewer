{"importance": "This paper introduces an innovative method for creating personalized 3D avatars from a few images, which can be useful in **XR, gaming and virtual try-on**. It offers a fast and efficient way to generate realistic avatars, **reducing the reliance on complex setups or manual design**, and opens avenues for real-time avatar creation and animation.", "summary": "FRESA: fast feedforward 3D personalized avatar creation from few images.", "takeaways": ["FRESA enables fast and zero-shot generation of personalized 3D human avatars with pose-dependent animation using a universal clothed human model.", "The 3D canonicalization process with multi-frame aggregation effectively improves the fidelity and realism of reconstructed avatars.", "The method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in reconstruction fidelity and animation quality."], "tldr": "Existing methods for 3D human avatar creation often require extensive per-subject optimization, limiting their real-world use. They struggle with variations in body shape, pose, and clothing, leading to deformation artifacts and high computational costs. Many techniques also rely on laborious manual design or controlled environments, making them impractical for everyday applications. Reconstructing animatable avatars from casually taken photos remains a significant challenge.\n\nThis paper introduces FRESA, a novel method for reconstructing personalized 3D human avatars from only a few images. It uses a feed-forward approach, generalizing to casually taken phone photos without fine-tuning. FRESA learns a universal prior from a large dataset of clothed humans, enabling instant generation and zero-shot generalization. It jointly infers personalized avatar shape, skinning weights, and pose-dependent deformations. A 3D canonicalization process and multi-frame feature aggregation reduce artifacts and fuse a plausible avatar, preserving person-specific identities.", "affiliation": "Australian National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.19207/podcast.wav"}
