Existing approaches often involve complex architectures or suboptimal performance due to the separate handling of these two tasks. This separation can limit the model's overall capabilities and efficiency. \nJanusFlow, proposed in this paper, tackles this problem with a minimalist architecture that integrates autoregressive language models with rectified flow. By decoupling the understanding and generation encoders and aligning their representations during training, JanusFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in both visual understanding and image generation. This work demonstrates a more efficient and versatile approach, surpassing existing unified models across multiple standard benchmarks. The results highlight the potential of JanusFlow for more efficient and versatile vision-language models.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.07975/podcast.wav"}
