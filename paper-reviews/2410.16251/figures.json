For real-world hallucinations, we holistically assess the performance of knowledge editing on Efficacy, Generalization, Portability, Locality, and Robustness.", "description": "The figure presents a flowchart illustrating the HalluEditBench framework for evaluating knowledge editing methods. It begins with a large language model (LLM) generating a hallucinated answer to a question.  Knowledge editing is then applied, aiming to correct the hallucination. The evaluation process assesses the edited LLM across five dimensions: Efficacy (measuring accuracy on the original question after editing), Generalization (assessing performance on rephrased and similar questions), Portability (evaluating the impact of the edit on related questions), Locality (measuring side effects on unrelated questions), and Robustness (testing the persistence of the correction against adversarial prompts).  The flowchart visually represents how HalluEditBench uses different question-answer pairs to evaluate the effectiveness of knowledge editing methods in correcting real-world hallucinations.", "section": "HalluEditBench: HOLISTICALLY BENCHMARKING KNOWLEDGE EDITING METHODS IN CORRECTING REAL-WORLD HALLUCINATIONS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.16251/figures/figures_3_0.png", "caption": "Statistics of HalluEditBench Across Topics and Domains.", "description": "The figure displays the distribution of hallucinations across various topics and domains for three different LLMs: Llama2-7B, Llama3-8B, and Mistral-v0.3-7B. Each subfigure (a, b, c) represents a different LLM and shows a donut chart visualizing the percentage of hallucinations within each topic. The topics are categorized into nine domains: art, business, entertainment, event, geography, health, human, places, and technology.  The size of each segment in the donut chart corresponds to the proportion of hallucinations found in that specific topic within the dataset for the respective LLM.", "section": "HalluEditBench: HOLISTICALLY BENCHMARKING KNOWLEDGE EDITING METHODS IN CORRECTING REAL-WORLD HALLUCINATIONS"}]
