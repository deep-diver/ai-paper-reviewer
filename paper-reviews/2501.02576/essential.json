Existing methods either rely on large-scale datasets, resulting in time-consuming training, or suffer from low inference speed and suboptimal results. \nDepthMaster, a single-step diffusion model, overcomes these issues.  It introduces a Feature Alignment module to enhance feature representation by integrating high-quality semantic features, and a Fourier Enhancement module to balance low-frequency structure and high-frequency details, mimicking the iterative refinement process for visual quality. A two-stage training strategy is employed for optimal performance, leading to state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks.  The model demonstrates superior detail preservation and generalization capabilities compared to existing diffusion-based and data-driven approaches.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.02576/podcast.wav"}
