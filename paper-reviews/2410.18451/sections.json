Discriminative models, commonly using the Bradley-Terry loss, focus on directly comparing preferred and rejected responses, with recent advancements including techniques to address biases (e.g., favoring longer responses) and improve generalization. Generative models offer an alternative approach, directly evaluating LLM outputs, but often lag in performance compared to discriminative models.  However, techniques to bridge this performance gap, such as auxiliary tasks or contrastive learning, are being explored.  Finally, DPO methods achieve reward modeling without an explicit reward model, deriving reward signals directly from policy and preference data, though they often underperform compared to the other two approaches.  The overview highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, setting the stage for the authors' proposed methods in subsequent sections.", "first_cons": "The section primarily focuses on describing existing methods, offering limited critical analysis or comparison of the effectiveness of each approach beyond broad generalizations (e.g., generative models lag behind discriminative models).
