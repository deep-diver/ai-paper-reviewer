The lack of high-quality datasets with diverse garment styles, poses, and deformations poses significant challenges. This paper tackles these issues by introducing GarVerseLOD, a hierarchical dataset with levels of details that addresses the limitation of previous methods. \nGarVerseLOD contains 6,000 high-quality garment models crafted by professionals and a novel data labeling paradigm is used for image generation. The proposed framework uses a coarse-to-fine reconstruction strategy and leverages the hierarchical structure of the dataset.  The results demonstrate significant improvements in reconstruction quality and robustness compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the effectiveness of the approach. This offers a powerful tool for various applications relying on accurate 3D garment models.", "affiliation": "SSE, CUHKSZ, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}}
