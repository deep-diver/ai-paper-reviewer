It starts with a **simplified, coarse model**, capturing the overall shape and pose, before progressively refining it by incorporating finer details and intricate deformations. This approach offers several advantages. Firstly, it simplifies a complex problem into manageable sub-problems. The coarse stage provides a robust initial estimate, reducing the search space for subsequent refinement steps. Secondly, it improves the efficiency of the reconstruction process by focusing computational resources on the most essential aspects initially.  Finally, it enhances the generalization ability of the model to unseen data as the initial stage focuses on learning underlying garment properties that are less sensitive to variations in appearance, texture, and pose."}}, {"heading_title": "Boundary Prediction", "details": {"summary": "Accurate boundary prediction is crucial for high-fidelity 3D garment reconstruction, as it defines the garment's shape and enables realistic rendering.
