Existing strategies often fail to capture instruction-following complexities. Therefore, diverse signals are needed to capture instruction-response characteristics, using Multi-LLM wisdom to understand diverse responses and reward model assessments.\n\nTo address these issues, **CROWDSELECT**, an integrated metric with clustering, maintains response diversity. Results showed improvements, achieving state-of-the-art performance in Full and LoRA fine-tuning. It improves Arena-Hard by 4.81% and MT-bench by 11.1% with Llama-3.2-3b-instruct, bringing new insights.
