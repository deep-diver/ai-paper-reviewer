[{"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.02959/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 1. Information loss in HTML to plain text conversion.", "description": "The figure illustrates the loss of structural and semantic information that occurs when converting HTML to plain text.  The left side shows an HTML table with clear structure and semantic meaning (indicated by tags and formatting). The right side displays the same information rendered as plain text, where the original table structure and semantic cues (like <code> tags or <a> tags) are lost. This loss makes the information less precise and less easily understandable by LLMs, which rely heavily on structural information and semantic cues to process and understand text effectively.", "section": "Introduction"}]
