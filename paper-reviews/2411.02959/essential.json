{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in information retrieval and natural language processing.  It **challenges the conventional approach** of using plain text in RAG systems and **demonstrates the benefits of leveraging HTML's structural information**. This opens new avenues for improving knowledge retrieval and generation accuracy, impacting various applications like question answering and document summarization. The proposed HTML pruning techniques also offer valuable insights into efficient data processing for LLMs.", "summary": "HtmlRAG boosts RAG system accuracy by using HTML, not plain text, to model retrieved knowledge, improving knowledge representation and mitigating LLM hallucination.", "takeaways": ["Using HTML instead of plain text in RAG systems significantly improves the accuracy of knowledge retrieval and generation.", "HtmlRAG's HTML cleaning and two-step pruning methods effectively reduce HTML length while preserving crucial information for LLMs.", "Experimental results across multiple QA datasets confirm the superiority of HTML-based RAG over traditional text-based methods."], "tldr": "Current Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically convert HTML web pages to plain text before feeding them to Large Language Models (LLMs). This process loses crucial structural and semantic information present in the HTML, potentially leading to less accurate and more hallucinated outputs.  This paper addresses this limitation by proposing HtmlRAG, a novel approach. \nHtmlRAG uses HTML as the knowledge format in RAG systems.  To overcome the challenges of processing long HTML sequences containing irrelevant information (e.g. CSS, JavaScript), the authors introduce HTML cleaning and compression strategies, followed by a two-step pruning method that leverages both text embedding and a generative model to select relevant HTML blocks.  Extensive experiments on six different QA datasets demonstrate that HtmlRAG significantly outperforms existing text-based methods.  The paper thus suggests a paradigm shift in how external knowledge is processed within RAG pipelines.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}}
