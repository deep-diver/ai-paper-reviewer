Existing models often hallucinate or lack temporal accuracy.  This necessitates the need for better training data and more advanced training techniques.\n\nTarsier2 addresses these issues by implementing a three-stage training process involving a massive dataset (40M video-text pairs), fine-grained temporal alignment during supervised fine-tuning, and model-based sampling for direct preference optimization. The result is a state-of-the-art LVLM that substantially outperforms existing models across multiple video understanding benchmarks, demonstrating its ability for detailed video descriptions, question answering, and grounding.  A new recaptioning dataset is also released.", "affiliation": "ByteDance Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.07888/podcast.wav"}
