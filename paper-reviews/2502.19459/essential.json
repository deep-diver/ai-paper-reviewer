Current methods also rely on pre-trained models, neglect motion information, and struggle with accurate pixel matching across states, which leads to unstable learning and limits joint learning.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces **ArtGS**, leveraging 3D Gaussians and canonical Gaussians with coarse-to-fine initialization to align part information. The use of skinning-inspired dynamics module enhances mesh reconstruction and articulation learning. Experiments showed ArtGS excels in joint parameter estimation and part mesh reconstruction, especially for complex multi-part objects. It enhances reconstruction quality/efficiency and offers design analyses, highlighting potential future improvements.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2502.19459/podcast.wav"}
