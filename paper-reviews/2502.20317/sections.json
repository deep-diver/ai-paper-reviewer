[{"heading_title": "Mixture Retrieval", "details": {"summary": "The concept of 'Mixture Retrieval,' as implied by the paper, centers around harmonizing structural and textual knowledge retrieval from Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (**TG-KBs**). This approach is crucial because TG-KBs inherently store information in both structured (graph-based) and unstructured (textual) forms. Traditional methods often treat these retrieval processes in isolation, failing to leverage their mutual reinforcement. A true mixture retrieval system, as envisioned in this work, would intelligently **interleave structural traversal and textual matching**, adaptively balancing their contributions based on query characteristics and dataset properties. The core challenge lies in creating a framework that can dynamically determine when and how to prioritize structural versus textual cues, overcoming the limitations of rigid, pre-defined rules or simple aggregation techniques. The paper addresses this by introducing a **Planning-Reasoning-Organizing** framework that facilitates better retrieval performance by integrating both knowledge graphs."}}, {"heading_title": "Planning graphs", "details": {"summary": "Planning graphs are crucial for effective retrieval by outlining the logic for answering queries. **They preserve structural signals without rewording neighbors,** addressing limitations of existing methods. They **encode query-specific constraints and entity categories,** enabling generalization to new queries with similar underlying logic. Unlike rigid heuristics or step-by-step LLMs, planning graphs are generated in one shot, **reducing computational costs.** The method generalizes learned patterns adapting efficiently to new queries with same logic."}}, {"heading_title": "Structure rerank", "details": {"summary": "**Structure-aware reranking** is a crucial step in refining retrieval results, especially when dealing with diverse knowledge sources. After initial retrieval from textual and structural sources, a reranking mechanism helps to prioritize the most relevant candidates. It leverages trajectory information and structural features to refine the results. A key idea is the emphasis on structural trajectories, which capture how candidates are reached through structural paths, along with semantic matching using models."}}, {"heading_title": "Ablation studies", "details": {"summary": "The ablation studies systematically dissect the contribution of each component within the proposed model, offering granular insights into their individual and collective impacts. **Module ablation** identifies the synergistic effect of Text Retrieval, Structural Retrieval, and Reranker. Eliminating the Reranker consistently degrades performance, highlighting its importance in noise filtering. **Feature ablation** reveals that in structural-heavy knowledge, features contribute less but contribute more when a structured signal is found, showing the importance of trajectory structural knowledge."}}, {"heading_title": "Limits of MoR", "details": {"summary": "The paper acknowledges limitations of Mixture of Retrieval (MoR). The primary bottleneck is **lack of domain-specific knowledge**, hindering performance especially in specialized areas like biomedicine, as seen with the PRIME dataset, this indicates even advanced LLMs struggle without tailored expertise. Second, **Reranking limitations as it uses every retrieval layer**. Current reranker is also limited to the most informative path. Overcoming these limitations could involve adaptive path integration and MoE."}}]
