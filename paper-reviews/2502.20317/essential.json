{"importance": "This paper offers a novel method to retrieve information by combining textual and structural data from knowledge bases, overcoming limitations of isolated approaches. It enhances question-answering systems and provides a framework for adaptive knowledge integration, inspiring data-centric reasoning designs and error control of planning.", "summary": "MoR: Adaptive knowledge retrieval by fusing structural and textual data for better question answering.", "takeaways": ["MOR is superior in harmonizing textual and structural retrieval.", "Queries on different TG-KBs require varying desires for textual and structural knowledge.", "Trajectory info of candidates is critical in reranking."], "tldr": "Text-rich Graph Knowledge Bases (TG-KBs) are essential for answering queries with textual and structural knowledge. However, existing methods often retrieve these types of knowledge separately, neglecting their mutual reinforcement. Some hybrid methods bypass structural retrieval entirely after neighbor aggregation. The paper identifies three challenges: the high resource demands of rewording aggregated neighbors, the discarding of structural signals after neighbor aggregation, and the oversight of varying structural and textual knowledge desires across different queries and TG-KBs.\n\nTo address these challenges, the paper introduces a Mixture of Structural-and-Textual Retrieval (MoR) framework. MoR starts with a planning module that generates textual planning graphs to preserve structural signals. A reasoning module interweaves structural traversal and textual matching, enabling mutual reinforcement between retrieval types. An organizing module uses a structure-aware reranker to adaptively adjust the importance of retrieved knowledge. **Experiments demonstrate MoR's superiority in harmonizing structural and textual retrieval**, highlighting uneven retrieving performance across query logics and the benefits of integrating structural trajectories for candidate reranking.", "affiliation": "University of Oregon", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2502.20317/podcast.wav"}
