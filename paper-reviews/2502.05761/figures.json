First row: Left: reverse distillation; Right: our proposed paradigm.", "description": "This figure illustrates the difference between the traditional reverse distillation method for anomaly detection and the novel approach proposed in the paper. The traditional method (left panel) involves distilling knowledge from a teacher network trained on abnormal data to a student network for anomaly detection. In contrast, the proposed method (right panel) uses a heterogeneous distillation paradigm with recovery guidance. This new method involves using both normal and abnormal samples to train teacher networks with different architectures. These teachers extract diverse features that are then combined in a student network, improving the localization of defects. Furthermore, a recovery network is used to restore the normal features from abnormal ones which helps capture normal patterns and guide the detection process. This novel approach is especially useful for detecting small defects which are commonly missed by traditional methods.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.05761/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: 3CAD dataset samples.

CFRG consists of two main stages: 1) Coarse Localization and 2) Fine Localization. The first stage uses a teacher-student network approach where both normal (x<sub>n</sub>) and anomaly (x<sub>a</sub>) images are fed into the teacher network, while only the anomaly image is fed into the student network.  The distillation loss is calculated between the teacher and student networks to achieve coarse localization of the anomaly.  The second stage utilizes a recovery branch which learns to reconstruct normal features from anomalous ones. The output of this recovery branch, combined with the teacher's weighted features from the first stage, is then fed into a segmentation network to achieve a refined, pixel-level localization (final anomaly map).
