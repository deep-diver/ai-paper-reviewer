(b) The consistently larger FID degradation under directional noise demonstrates that velocity direction is more critical for generation quality.", "description": "Figure 1 consists of two subfigures. Subfigure (a) visualizes the velocity differences across various timesteps within a diffusion model. It uses two metrics, L2 distance and cosine similarity, to quantify the discrepancy in velocities between different timesteps. The results show that the velocity discrepancy increases as the distance between timesteps grows. Subfigure (b) investigates the impact of noise on the quality of generated images. By introducing noise that only affects the direction and magnitude of velocity separately, it demonstrates that noise impacting direction causes a significantly higher FID degradation. This highlights the importance of accurately matching the direction of velocity during flow matching.", "section": "1.

Subfigures (a) through (e) show how various approaches attempt to straighten the trajectory of a diffusion process (ideal trajectory is a straight line). Traditional methods (a)-(d) struggle to fully achieve this, resulting in curved trajectories, showing that optimization doesn't reach the theoretical ideal.  Subfigure (e) demonstrates the proposed Progressive Reflow method which provides a better approximation by breaking the process into smaller, easier-to-optimize steps. Subfigure (f) illustrates how the proposed Aligned v-Prediction technique refines velocity prediction by correcting the direction of the velocity vector between consecutive timesteps, thus improving accuracy.", "section": "3.

ProReflow-I uses 4 inference steps, while ProReflow-II employs only 2.  The x-axis represents the CFG scale (ranging from 2 to 7), while the y-axis shows the resulting FID and CLIP scores. The results are evaluated on the COCO-2017 dataset, providing insights into model robustness and efficiency across different CFG settings. The curves reveal how FID and CLIP scores vary as the CFG scale changes for both models, helping to compare their performance. ", "section": "4. Experiments"}]
