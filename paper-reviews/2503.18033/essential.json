Current video inpainting techniques, when applied to object removal, often fail to preserve background fidelity or introduce temporal inconsistencies across frames. This limits their practicality for real-time applications.\n\nThis paper introduces **OmnimatteZero**, a novel training-free approach that leverages pre-trained video diffusion models for real-time omnimatte. It adapts image inpainting techniques for video object removal, using self-attention maps to capture and inpaint object effects. This approach enables the extraction of clean background layers and object layers, which can be seamlessly recomposed onto new videos. **OmnimatteZero achieves state-of-the-art performance in background reconstruction and runs in real-time**.", "affiliation": "OriginAI, Tel-Aviv, Israel", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18033/podcast.wav"}
