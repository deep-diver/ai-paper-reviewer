While LLMs have achieved impressive results on various language-based tasks and even complex math benchmarks, they surprisingly struggle with basic arithmetic like 5-digit multiplication.  This raises questions about the underlying mechanisms and whether the approach differs from traditional autoregressive language modeling.  Prior research focusing on causal attribution has yielded some insight into which model components are involved in arithmetic operations but hasn't fully explained *why* LLMs struggle with certain arithmetic tasks.  For instance, a study might identify a specific attention head responsible for a correct calculation, but not explain why the model fails on a similar, but slightly different, problem.  The authors propose a two-pronged approach to investigate this problem: 1) examining whether LLMs leverage partial products (intermediate calculations) during arithmetic learning and 2) exploring how LLMs approach arithmetic symbolically by analyzing task decomposition into smaller sub-problems (subgroups). This approach offers a deeper understanding of the symbolic learning process.", "first_cons": "The introduction lacks concrete examples of the types of arithmetic problems that LLMs struggle with, making it difficult to fully grasp the scale of the problem before delving into the methodology.", "first_pros": "The introduction effectively establishes the context and motivation for the research.

It begins by explaining autoregressive language modeling, the fundamental mechanism behind how large language models (LLMs) predict the next token in a sequence based on previously observed tokens. The probability of a sequence is calculated using the chain rule. The section then introduces the algebraic structure of a ring, providing a formal framework for arithmetic operations (addition and multiplication).  A ring is defined by a set of elements (integers, in this case) and two binary operations.  Finally, the section defines arithmetic learning in the context of LLMs. It describes an arithmetic task as a function learning problem where the model aims to predict numerical outputs based on arithmetic expressions. The training dataset consists of input operands and their corresponding outputs computed using a specific operator (+ or \u00d7). The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to accurately predict the output given input operands and the operator.

Four different multiplication methods were tested: standard multiplication, repetitive addition, the lattice method, and Egyptian multiplication.  The study fine-tuned two LLMs (Gemma-2-2B and Llama-3.1-8B) on two-digit multiplication tasks and then evaluated their ability to identify partial products before and after fine-tuning. The results showed that while fine-tuning improved the LLMs' ability to identify partial products (e.g., gains of +17.45%, +18.35%, and +10.45% for standard, lattice, and Egyptian methods, respectively), this improvement didn't translate to better performance on the actual multiplication tasks.

It introduces the concept of subgroups within arithmetic tasks, defining them at the token level and quantifying their complexity using domain space cardinality (|D|), label space entropy (H(L)), and subgroup quality (Q(s)). The researchers analyze the difficulty of arithmetic learning through a well-educated hypothesis that links difficulty to subgroup complexity, focusing on label space entropy and subgroup quality.  Experiments involving label space entropy perturbations show that reducing entropy (decreasing variability in the label space) leads to improved accuracy, supporting the hypothesis that LLMs operate symbolically.
