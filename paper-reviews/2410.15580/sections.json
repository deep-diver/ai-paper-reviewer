It highlights the performance gap between LLMs and human capabilities in arithmetic, particularly with 5-digit multiplication. The introduction challenges the common assumption that this difficulty arises from the inherent differences between language modeling and numerical computation. Instead, it proposes a novel approach of investigating LLM's approach to arithmetic through two perspectives: whether LLMs leverage partial products and how LLMs handle arithmetic symbolically. The core of the introduction lies in posing the central research question:  Why do advanced LLMs struggle with even basic arithmetic, and what underlying mechanisms are at play?  This question is framed in the context of the rapid progress LLMs have made on other challenging tasks, making this arithmetic gap particularly interesting and worthy of dedicated investigation. The introduction briefly touches upon previous research which has mainly focused on identifying the components in the LLM's architecture responsible for arithmetic, but notes that these analyses are inadequate in explaining why LLMs struggle with some arithmetic tasks while succeeding in others.  The authors argue that this knowledge gap necessitates an alternative approach, hence this two-pronged experimental methodology.", "first_cons": "The introduction lacks a comprehensive review of prior art related to LLMs and arithmetic learning.

However, the existing research primarily focuses on addressing challenges in solving math word problems, where natural language is involved, rather than directly tackling the core computational aspects of arithmetic within the LLMs. The review also touches upon the efforts focused on understanding arithmetic learning by analyzing internal model components like attention layers and attention heads, which provide insights into what parts of the model are involved in arithmetic, but don't fully explain why LLMs continue to struggle with some arithmetic problems.  A gap is identified in current research: while there is work on component-level analysis, a thorough understanding of how LLMs learn arithmetic from a purely symbolic perspective remains lacking.

The analysis reveals that LLMs tend to select subgroups based on an easy-to-hard paradigm, initially focusing on subgroups with high quality and progressively tackling those with lower quality.  A key observation is the U-shaped accuracy curve across digit positions in multiplication tasks (e.g., 95% accuracy at the beginning and end positions, dropping to ~10% in the middle), suggesting that LLMs find the middle digits significantly harder to predict.
