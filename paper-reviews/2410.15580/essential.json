Contrary to the belief that LLMs perform calculations like humans, the researchers found that LLMs learn arithmetic symbolically. They don't use partial products in the way humans do; instead, they identify patterns within subgroups of data.  The difficulty of an arithmetic task depends on the complexity and selection of these subgroups, which are characterized by label space entropy and subgroup quality.  Interestingly, LLM accuracy follows a U-shaped curve across different positions within a numerical sequence \u2013 they perform well on the beginning and end digits but struggle with middle digits. This is because easier patterns are learned first, leaving the more complex patterns in the middle to be learned later.  Overall, the study shows LLMs are symbolic learners, emphasizing the importance of understanding them through subgroup-level quantification."}
