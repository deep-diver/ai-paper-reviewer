We begin by investigating partial products and proceed to a detailed examination at the subgroup level to understand the mechanism in a symbolic manner.", "description": "The figure illustrates the two-pronged approach of the paper to investigate arithmetic learning in LLMs. The left side shows the investigation of whether LLMs leverage partial products, starting with autoregressive language modeling for multiplication and examining partial product identification before and after fine-tuning.  The right side delves into how LLMs handle arithmetic symbolically at a subgroup level by breaking down the multiplication task into subproblems (subgroups) based on the digits of the operands and considering subgroup complexity (domain space cardinality, label space entropy, and subgroup quality) and subgroup selection.  The overall flow of the diagram highlights the shift from examining partial products to analyzing the symbolic nature of LLM learning via subgroup-level analysis.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
