Traditional algorithms rely on assumptions about scene color distributions that don't always hold true. Learning-based methods can perform better, but often require retraining for each new camera, which is impractical. This paper tackles the issue of **generalizing color constancy across different camera sensors.**\n\nThe paper introduces a novel method called GCC that uses diffusion models to inpaint color checkers into images, then uses these checkers to estimate the scene's illumination. This involves a **deterministic inference approach for inpainting**, Laplacian composition for checker structure, and a data augmentation strategy for imprecise color checker annotations. **GCC is robust in cross-camera scenarios** without sensor-specific training.", "affiliation": "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.17435/podcast.wav"}
