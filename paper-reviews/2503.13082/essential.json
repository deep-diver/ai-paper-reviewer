To address these issues, the paper introduces FreeGrasp, a free-form language-based robotic grasping approach. \n\n**FreeGrasp leverages pre-trained VLMs' world knowledge to interpret instructions and object spatial arrangement**.  It detects objects as keypoints and uses these to annotate images, facilitating VLM spatial reasoning. FreeGrasp determines if an object is graspable or if obstructing objects must be removed first. Validated with FreeGraspData and real-world experiments, **it demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in grasp reasoning and execution, robustly interpreting instructions and inferring actions for object grasping.", "affiliation": "Fondazione Bruno Kessler", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2503.13082/podcast.wav"}
