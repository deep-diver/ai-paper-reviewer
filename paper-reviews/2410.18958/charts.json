SCT has faster convergence speed and better performance upper bound than ECT.", "description": "This chart displays the FID scores plotted against training iterations for both ECT and SCT methods, shown separately for 1-step and 2-step generation.  The log scale on the y-axis highlights the FID score improvement over training time. In both 1-step and 2-step scenarios, SCT demonstrates significantly faster convergence, reaching a lower FID score (indicating better performance) compared to ECT within the same number of training iterations.  Inset graphs provide a zoomed-in view of the final training iterations, further emphasizing the performance gap between SCT and ECT.", "section": "5.2 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18958/charts/charts_9_0.png", "caption": "Comparison of Methods on 1-step and 2-step FID", "description": "The chart displays a comparison of FID scores for one-step and two-step generation across three different methods: a baseline without a stable training target, a method using a stable target computed within each training batch, and a method employing a stable target computed from all training samples.  The x-axis represents the method used, while the y-axis shows the FID score for both one-step (left y-axis, teal line) and two-step (right y-axis, green dashed line) generation.  The results clearly indicate that incorporating a stable training target, especially when calculated from all training data, leads to a significant reduction in FID scores for both one-step and two-step generation, demonstrating improved model performance.", "section": "5.2 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18958/charts/charts_9_1.png", "caption": "Figure 5: The effectiveness of edge-skipping multi-step sampling.", "description": "The chart displays the FID scores (log scale) on the y-axis against training iterations on the x-axis.  Multiple lines represent different scaling factors (\u03b7) used in edge-skipping multistep sampling (\u03b7 = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0).  The main plot shows the FID scores across the whole training process, while an inset focuses on the final iterations (180k-200k) providing a zoomed-in view of the FID scores at the end of training for each scaling factor.
