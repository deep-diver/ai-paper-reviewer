The methods are categorized into fast samplers and distillation for diffusion models, direct generation methods, and consistency training/tuning methods. For each method, the number of forward-backward Euler steps (NFE) required for generation and the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) score are provided.  A lower FID indicates better sample quality.  The table shows that SCT achieves superior performance compared to most existing methods.", "section": "5.2 RESULTS AND ANALYSIS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18958/tables/table_4_0.md", "caption": "Table 1: The definition of symbols in the value estimation of the PF-ODE equivalent MDP.", "description": "This table defines the symbols used in the value estimation of the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) equivalent Markov Decision Process (MDP).  It lists the MDP symbols and their corresponding definitions, including the state (Stn), action (atn), initial state distribution (Po(so)), state transition distribution (P(Stn+1 I Stn, atn)), policy function (\u03c0(atn I Stn)), reward function (R(Stn, atn)), and value function (V\u03b8(Stn)).  These definitions are crucial for understanding the mathematical formulation of the training process of consistency models as a temporal difference learning process within the MDP framework, as described in the paper.", "section": "Understanding Consistency Models"}]
