Consistency models are faster than other leading methods, but existing training methods suffer from high variance and instability.  SCT addresses this by using variance reduction methods (leveraging the score identity) and a refined training schedule.  The authors frame the training process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and value estimation, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding the model's behavior. Experiments on standard datasets (CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-64) demonstrate that SCT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving faster convergence and improved image quality.  The results show significant improvements in FID (Frechet Inception Distance) scores, a common metric for evaluating generated image quality."}
