Diffusion models are described as a forward stochastic process where noise is iteratively added to an image until it becomes pure noise, and the reverse process aims to reconstruct the image from noise. This reverse process, represented as a Probability Flow ODE (PF-ODE), forms the basis for understanding consistency models.\n\nConsistency models are introduced as a method to accelerate the generation process by directly learning to predict the starting point (x0) of the PF-ODE from an intermediate noisy image (xt) rather than iteratively denoising. Two main training strategies are discussed: consistency distillation (CD), which leverages a pre-trained diffusion model as a teacher, and consistency training/tuning (CT), which learns directly from data.  The section emphasizes that both methods share the same loss function, aiming to ensure that predictions from different points along the same PF-ODE trajectory converge to the same solution. The loss function is given as  `d(fo(xt, t), fo-(xr,r))`, where 'd' represents a distance metric, 'fo' is the consistency model, 'xt' and 'xr' are points on a trajectory, and '\u03b8\u00af' is the exponentially moving average (EMA) of the model's weights.", "first_cons": "The explanation of the forward and reverse processes in diffusion models, while providing context, could be made more visually intuitive.

CD, which uses a pre-trained diffusion model, is shown to have a lower performance ceiling but greater training stability, due to a more accurate estimation of the ground truth reward.  Conversely, CT, trained directly from data, presents higher performance potential but struggles with high training variance caused by less precise reward estimation.
