The introduction highlights the trade-off between the high quality and training stability of diffusion models and their computational cost, especially when generating high-dimensional data like high-resolution images and videos. Consistency models aim to overcome this limitation by enabling high-quality, one-step generation without adversarial training.

It begins by defining diffusion models as a forward stochastic process, represented by a stochastic differential equation (SDE), and introducing the key concept of the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE). This PF-ODE represents the reverse-time process, crucial for sampling, achieved by numerically solving the ODE, a process that consistency models aim to optimize. The section then introduces consistency models, highlighting that their core training objective is to enforce the self-consistency condition, which means predictions along the same PF-ODE trajectory should converge to the same solution.  Two training methods are introduced: consistency distillation (CD), leveraging a pretrained diffusion model, and consistency training/tuning (CT), learned directly from data.

The framework highlights the crucial role of reward estimation in differentiating between two main training approaches: consistency distillation (CD) and consistency training/tuning (CT).

The core idea is to improve training stability and speed by reducing the training variance and discretization error.  SCT achieves this through three main strategies:\n\n1. **Variance Reduction:** SCT incorporates variance-reduced learning using the score identity.  This leads to significant performance improvements, particularly in conditional generation settings. For example, on ImageNet-64, SCT achieves a new state-of-the-art 1-step FID of 2.42 and a 2-step FID of 1.55. \n2. **Discretization Error Reduction:** SCT uses a smoother progressive training schedule to reduce the error from the numerical solving process of the ODE. This schedule involves gradually decreasing the step size (\u2206t) during training, balancing faster optimization in the beginning with higher accuracy at the end. \n3. **Multistep Sampling:** SCT extends the scope of ECT to multistep settings allowing deterministic multistep sampling. An edge-skipping strategy is introduced to further improve efficiency in multi-step scenarios. Also, it explores the use of classifier-free guidance by replacing unconditional outputs with a sub-optimal version of the model.\n\nIn short, SCT offers a framework to understand the training of consistency models and enhances their performance significantly by strategically addressing training variance and discretization errors through variance reduction, smoother training schedules, and improved multistep sampling techniques.", "first_cons": "While SCT demonstrates significant improvements, its focus on variance reduction and discretization error may not fully address all limitations of consistency models.
