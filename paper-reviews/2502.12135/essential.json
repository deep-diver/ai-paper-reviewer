The lack of large-scale datasets has also hindered the development of automated solutions. This paper presents significant challenges in current 3D animation pipelines. \nThe paper introduces MagicArticulate, a novel framework that addresses these challenges.  It uses an auto-regressive transformer for skeleton generation, handling varying bone numbers efficiently. Skinning weights are predicted using a functional diffusion process that incorporates volumetric geodesic distance priors, improving accuracy on complex topologies.  **MagicArticulate significantly outperforms existing methods across diverse object categories**, achieving high-quality articulation for realistic animation.  The paper also introduces Articulation-XL, a substantial benchmark dataset to facilitate future research.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2502.12135/podcast.wav"}
