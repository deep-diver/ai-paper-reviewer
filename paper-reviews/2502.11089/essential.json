Existing sparse attention methods often struggle to achieve sufficient speedups in practice or lack effective training-time support.  This paper introduces Native Sparse Attention (NSA), which addresses these limitations. \n\nNSA employs a dynamic hierarchical sparse strategy, combining coarse-grained token compression with fine-grained token selection to preserve both global context and local precision.  **The method is hardware-aligned for efficient computation, and importantly, enables end-to-end training**.  Extensive experiments demonstrate NSA's superior performance and efficiency over full attention and other sparse attention methods, across various benchmarks and sequence lengths.", "affiliation": "DeepSeek-AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.11089/podcast.wav"}
