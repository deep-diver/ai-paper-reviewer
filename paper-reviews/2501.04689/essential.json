Regression-based methods are fast but struggle with occluded regions, while generative methods are accurate but computationally expensive and often misaligned with visible surfaces.  The problem is tackled by a new two-stage approach that combines both methods' strengths. \n\nThe proposed method, SPAR3D, first utilizes a lightweight point diffusion model to generate a sparse 3D point cloud quickly.  Then, it employs a meshing stage that refines this point cloud using image data to create highly detailed meshes, enabling probabilistic modeling while maintaining efficiency. This design allows for interactive edits, showcasing superior performance on various datasets with a remarkable inference speed of 0.7 seconds.", "affiliation": "Stability AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.04689/podcast.wav"}
