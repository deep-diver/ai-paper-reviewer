In multimodal understanding, early works like LLaVA and MiniGPT-4 demonstrated strong performance on various image understanding tasks but primarily focused on text-based outputs.  More recent research explores MLLMs for visual generation, enabling image-text processing and generation. However, existing methods often struggle with balancing the diversity needed for tasks like text-to-image generation and the precise control required for image editing and manipulation.  A common challenge highlighted is the reliance on single-granular image features extracted from visual encoders, neglecting the varying granularity needs of different tasks.  Methods like SEED-X attempt to address this by using conditional image input to improve control, but a unified, truly multi-granular solution remains underexplored.  Alternative approaches, including discrete image tokenization and transforming the MLLM itself into a denoiser, are discussed, but these methods often face drawbacks such as information loss or high computational costs.  The overall trend is toward unifying understanding and generation capabilities within a single MLLM, but the challenge of efficiently handling multi-granular visual information remains significant.", "first_cons": "Many existing approaches fail to adequately address the varying granularity requirements of diverse image generation tasks within a unified MLLM framework.

It consists of three key modules: an image encoder that extracts multi-scale image features (from coarse-grained to fine-grained); an autoregressive MLLM that processes and generates these multi-scale features; and a set of diffusion-based image decoders that reconstruct or generate images from the MLLM-generated features at different granularities.  A two-stage training strategy is employed: first, the diffusion models are fine-tuned, then the autoregressive MLLM is trained using a combination of cross-entropy loss for text and regression loss for images.  This framework allows seamless transitions between image generation and understanding tasks with varying granularity requirements, balancing diversity and controllability. The multi-scale feature extraction leverages a CLIP semantic image encoder to generate the initial high-resolution features (256 visual tokens) and derives lower-resolution features through successive 2D average pooling (64, 16, 4, and 1 visual tokens respectively) at various granular levels. The autoregressive MLLM processes these features progressively, refining its predictions as more information becomes available.  The diffusion-based image decoders, pretrained SDXL models, are modified to accept the multi-granular features to decode images.  The multi-granularity approach aims to improve the versatility and capability of MLLMs by adapting to different task demands and feature scales.", "first_cons": "The reliance on pre-trained models like SDXL for the image decoders might limit the model's flexibility and potential for further innovation in the visual decoding component.

The complexity also makes the model harder to interpret and debug.", "second_pros": "The two-stage training approach (pretraining followed by instruction tuning) enables the model to acquire broad multimodal capabilities and then specialize in targeted visual-linguistic tasks, leading to potentially superior performance.", "summary": "PUMA, a novel multi-granular MLLM paradigm, tackles the limitations of single-scale methods by employing a three-module framework: a multi-scale image encoder, an autoregressive MLLM, and multiple image decoders.
