Existing MLLMs have shown promise in visual generation, but they often struggle with the trade-off between generating diverse images and exercising precise control over image generation tasks.  The core issue is the varying granularity requirements of different image generation tasks \u2013 high diversity is needed for text-to-image generation while high controllability is crucial for tasks like image editing and inpainting.  Current methods typically rely on single-granularity features, failing to adapt to these different needs.  This limitation leads to models that excel in either diversity or controllability, but not both.  The paper introduces PUMA, a new paradigm that aims to solve this multi-granularity problem by integrating multiple visual features at different scales.  PUMA processes both fine-grained and coarse-grained features, enabling seamless transitions between diverse and controllable image generation tasks.", "first_cons": "The introduction section does not provide specific details or quantitative evidence about how existing MLLMs fail in addressing the diversity-controllability tradeoff.

It is divided into two subsections: Multimodal Understanding and Unified Understanding and Generation for MLLMs.  The first subsection discusses the progress made in multimodal understanding tasks, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in generating multimodal outputs beyond text.  The second subsection focuses on recent attempts to equip MLLMs with multimodal output capabilities, including image generation.  These attempts have shown promise but face a common challenge: the trade-off between generating diverse images from text and having precise control over image generation in tasks like editing and inpainting.  Existing works primarily rely on single-granular image features, which are insufficient for addressing the varying demands of different visual generation tasks.  The review notes that models optimized for diversity often lack fine-grained control, and vice versa.  Alternative approaches using discrete image tokens or transforming MLLMs into denoisers are mentioned but are noted to have limitations such as information loss or high computational costs.", "first_cons": "The section focuses heavily on the limitations of previous approaches without offering a comprehensive overview of successful methods.

It begins by using a CLIP semantic image encoder to extract features at multiple resolutions (high-resolution to coarse-grained), creating a multi-scale representation of the input image.  These features are then fed into an autoregressive MLLM which processes and generates multi-scale image features. Finally, dedicated diffusion-based image decoders reconstruct or generate images from these MLLM-generated features at varying levels of granularity.  This two-stage training process first involves fine-tuning pre-trained diffusion models as image decoders, then training the autoregressive MLLM using a combination of cross-entropy loss for text and regression loss for image features.  The training process leverages large-scale datasets and task-specific instruction tuning to enable PUMA to adapt to the granularity demands of various visual tasks.  The multi-granularity strategy allows PUMA to handle a wider spectrum of tasks, from diverse image generation to precise editing and highly controllable generation, which addresses the limitations of previous single-scale methods.", "first_cons": "The method's complexity might increase computational costs.
