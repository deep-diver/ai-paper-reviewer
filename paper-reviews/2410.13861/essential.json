Unlike previous approaches that struggle with balancing the need for diverse image generation and precise control in tasks like image editing, PUMA employs a multi-granular approach. It extracts and processes visual features at various levels of granularity (from coarse semantic concepts to fine-grained details), allowing it to adapt to the specific demands of different tasks.  This is achieved using a three-module system: an image encoder for feature extraction, an autoregressive MLLM for processing features, and multiple diffusion-based image decoders that generate images at different granularities.  The researchers trained PUMA in two stages: pretraining on a large multimodal dataset and subsequent instruction tuning for specific tasks.  Evaluations demonstrate PUMA's proficiency in a broad spectrum of visual tasks, including text-to-image generation, image editing, inpainting, and conditional generation, significantly outperforming existing models on various benchmarks and highlighting the advantages of its multi-granular design."}
