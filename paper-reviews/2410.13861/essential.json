Unlike previous models that typically focus on single-granularity features, PUMA processes and generates multi-granular visual representations \u2013 moving from coarse-grained semantic understanding to fine-grained details. This approach elegantly addresses the trade-off between generating diverse and highly realistic images (requiring coarse features) and performing tasks like precise image editing or manipulation (requiring fine-grained features).  PUMA's architecture includes an image encoder that extracts these multi-granular features, an autoregressive MLLM that processes them, and multiple diffusion-based decoders that reconstruct or generate images at the appropriate granularity.  The model is trained in two stages: first, a multimodal pretraining phase using a massive dataset of images and text; then, a task-specific instruction tuning phase.  Experimental results show that PUMA achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results across a variety of tasks such as text-to-image generation, image editing, conditional image generation, and image understanding.  The code and model will be released publicly, facilitating further research."}
