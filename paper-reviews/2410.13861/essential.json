Existing methods struggle with this trade-off because they typically use single-granularity features. PUMA solves this by utilizing multi-granular visual features\u2014from coarse semantic concepts to fine-grained details\u2014as both input and output. This allows it to adapt to the varying demands of different tasks. The model is trained in two stages: initial multimodal pretraining on various large-scale datasets (including Laion-2B, Laion-Aesthetics, and others), followed by task-specific instruction tuning.  Evaluations demonstrate PUMA's superior performance in multiple tasks, including text-to-image generation (achieving higher diversity and fidelity), image editing (showing more precise control), and image understanding. The findings indicate that PUMA's multi-granular approach is crucial for achieving a truly unified MLLM framework capable of handling a wide range of visual tasks."}
