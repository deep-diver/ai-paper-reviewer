Inverse PCG aims to automatically find optimal parameters given input conditions, yet existing methods struggle with lengthy sampling processes or lack controllability. This hinders efficient 3D asset creation for various applications.\nThis paper introduces DI-PCG, which tackles these challenges. It uses a lightweight diffusion transformer model that directly learns the mapping between image conditions and PCG parameters.  The model's efficiency is highlighted, requiring minimal training time and resources while effectively producing high-fidelity 3D assets. DI-PCG surpasses existing methods in accuracy and generalization to real-world images, offering a promising approach for efficient I-PCG and high-quality 3D asset creation.", "affiliation": "Tencent PCG", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.15200/podcast.wav"}
