Increasing depth, while theoretically improving compositional generalization (Petty et al., 2024), leads to over-smoothing, where token representations become homogenized, resulting in decreased performance in deeper models (Zhou et al., 2021).  This over-smoothing effect is attributed to the smoothing mechanism of attention (Shi et al., 2022) and is further exacerbated by the vanishing gradient problem despite the use of residual connections (He et al., 2016).  Existing solutions for mitigating this over-smoothing, such as adding regularizers (Nguyen et al., 2023; Shi et al., 2022) and optimizing information flow within the model (Pagliardini et al., 2024), present their own complexities and limitations.
