This paper introduces ResFormer, which addresses this by adding a residual connection from the first layer's values to all subsequent layers, effectively sharing information across layers and improving performance.  A variant, SVFormer, further enhances efficiency by sharing the same value embeddings across all layers, significantly reducing memory usage (KV cache). Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer and SVFormer significantly improve training and downstream task performance compared to vanilla transformers and other existing methods, especially for longer sequences.  The findings suggest that manipulating value flow in transformers is a promising approach to improving efficiency and addressing attention concentration problems."}
