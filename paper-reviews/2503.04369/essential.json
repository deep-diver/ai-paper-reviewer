However, they still suffer from \"translationese\", which leads to unnatural and overly literal translations. This issue is due to biases that are introduced during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. Pre-training on vast amounts of natural utterances should help LLMs generate natural sounding translations, but it does not due to the supervised fine-tuning. It makes the model biased towards the literal semantic mapping instead of a natural language generation.\n\nTo address these issues, this work systematically evaluates the prevalence of translationese in LLM-generated translations and investigates its roots during supervised training. They introduce methods such as polishing golden references and filtering unnatural training instances to mitigate the biases. The results suggest that these approaches help reduce translationese while improving the naturalness. Thus, they emphasize training-aware adjustments to optimize LLM translations.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Machine Translation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.04369/podcast.wav"}
