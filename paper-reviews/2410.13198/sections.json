However, real-world ASR applications face challenges due to variations in speech caused by factors like background noise, speaker accents, and different speaking styles. These factors significantly reduce ASR accuracy.  Humans exhibit resilience to these challenges due to inherent linguistic knowledge. Traditional ASR systems incorporate Language Models (LMs) to rescore hypotheses during decoding, but the emergence of large language models (LLMs) with advanced reasoning capabilities has opened up new possibilities beyond simple rescoring, leading to the development of Generative Error Correction (GEC). GEC models are trained to correct errors in the best hypothesis using information from other hypotheses, aiming to improve transcription accuracy.  However, current GEC models struggle to generalize beyond specific error types encountered during training and have difficulty correcting new, unseen errors, particularly in out-of-domain (OOD) scenarios.  This limitation is especially pronounced with named entities (NEs) due to insufficient contextual information or knowledge and the constant emergence of novel NEs.
