This is a significant advancement because it addresses the computational cost and privacy concerns associated with larger models, making expert-level medical reasoning more accessible.  The model's performance is validated against the MedQA benchmark, a collection of USMLE-style questions.  MedMobile achieves a 75.7% accuracy score, surpassing the passing score for physicians (~60%) and rivaling models 100 times its size.  The authors employ a strategy that involves fine-tuning with a combination of manually curated and synthetically generated data (from GPT-4 and textbooks) to achieve this performance. The paper analyzes the contribution of different techniques, highlighting that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, ensembling, and fine-tuning are the most effective approaches to improving the model's performance, while retrieval augmented generation (RAG) surprisingly does not improve performance.  The creation of MedMobile leverages the open-source phi-3-mini model as a foundation, highlighting the potential of smaller, open-source LMs for specialized applications when combined with effective fine-tuning and data augmentation strategies.\n\n### Fine-tuning Strategies and Data\n\nThe researchers employed a combination of manual and synthetic data for fine-tuning. Manual data included curated information by human experts. Synthetic data, generated using GPT-4 and textbooks, was integrated to significantly increase the size and quality of the training data, which the authors note is in line with the phi work that demonstrated reasoning capabilities in smaller models with less data. This approach underscores an efficiency in training and potential scalability that has been a barrier to wider implementation of LMs in medicine.\n\n### Ablation Studies and Performance Gains\n\nA key aspect of the study involved carefully testing individual components and their impact on performance.  This ablation study reveals the significant contribution of several techniques: chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning boosted performance by 2.4%, ensembling answers increased accuracy by 7.4%, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) provided an additional 8.4% improvement. Interestingly, approaches such as k-shot prompting with examples and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) did not yield any significant improvements and even hurt accuracy by 9.4% and 12.6%, respectively, showcasing that not all methods equally apply to low-parameter count models.  This highlights the careful engineering and selection of techniques required for such a model to effectively learn and reason within the context of medicine.  \n\n### Comparison with other models\n\nThe study makes several comparisons with other language models. It highlights that MedMobile achieves a result similar to much larger models (100x larger) which shows the potential for smaller, cost-effective models to be sufficient for the purpose.  MedMobile outperforms models such as Meerkat (7B parameters) which recently achieved a passing grade on USMLE-style questions, by over 20% accuracy points and showcases the ability of smaller models to successfully learn the complex concepts behind medical reasoning.
