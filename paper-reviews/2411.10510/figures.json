The figure visually represents the three models considered in the paper: DiT-XL, Stable Audio Open, and OpenSora.  Each model is depicted with its relevant DiT blocks, highlighting the specific layers (Self-attention, Cross-attention, and Feed-forward) that SmoothCache chooses to cache. The selection is based on the proximity of these layers to residual connections within each model's architecture. The diagram clarifies which layers are candidates for caching in each model to improve inference speed without significant quality loss.
