Existing acceleration methods like advanced solvers, knowledge distillation, and quantization either reduce the number of sampling steps or lower the inference cost per step, but they have limitations.  **Caching has emerged as a potential solution to address this issue** by exploiting the redundancy in the diffusion process, but existing caching techniques are either overly simplistic or model-specific. \nThis paper introduces SmoothCache, a novel model-agnostic inference acceleration technique for DiTs. **SmoothCache leverages the high similarity between layer outputs across adjacent diffusion timesteps.** By analyzing layer-wise representation errors from a small calibration set, SmoothCache adaptively caches and reuses key features during inference. **Experiments demonstrate that SmoothCache achieves 8% to 71% speed up while maintaining or even improving generation quality across diverse modalities.** It is also compatible with various common solvers. The findings suggest the technique has a significant impact on enabling real-time applications and broadening the accessibility of powerful DiT models.", "affiliation": "Roblox", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.10510/podcast.wav"}
