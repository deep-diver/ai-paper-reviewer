Existing dynamic convolution lacks the ability to adaptively capture features across different frequency bands. This limitation reduces the flexibility of dynamic convolution.  \n\nThis paper introduces **Frequency Dynamic Convolution (FDConv)**, learning in the Fourier domain with a fixed parameter budget. It divides this budget into frequency-based groups with disjoint Fourier indices. **FDConv** constructs multiple weights with diversified frequency responses. It includes Kernel Spatial Modulation (KSM) and Frequency Band Modulation (FBM) to enhance flexibility and improve convolution.", "affiliation": "Beijing Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18783/podcast.wav"}
