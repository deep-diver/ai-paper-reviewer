During encoding, we use an encoder to parapharse the input text given a user-chosen key. During decoding, we extract the bits from the text using the decoder.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two-stage process of the proposed text watermarking system.  The encoding stage uses an encoder (a paraphraser model fine-tuned with a specific key) to transform the original input text, embedding the watermark information. The decoder stage then takes the watermarked text and, using a trained classifier, extracts the embedded bits to recover the original watermark.  The key acts as a secret, ensuring only authorized parties with the same key can successfully decode the watermark.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.03123/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: The detection performance of our watermark compared with baseline methods with multiple repeats of the paraphraser. Note that some methods do not support multi-bit watermark code, so they do not have a curve of bit accuracy in the left figure.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of the proposed watermarking method with several baseline methods. The performance is measured by bit accuracy (how accurately the watermark bits are recovered), AUC (area under the ROC curve, reflecting the overall accuracy of watermark detection), and TPR@FPR (true positive rate at a specific false positive rate, indicating the accuracy of detection at low false alarm rates).  The x-axis represents the number of times the paraphrasing process is repeated; running the paraphrasing multiple times generally improves the watermark's robustness and detection accuracy.  The plot shows that the proposed method significantly outperforms baselines across all metrics. Note that the bit accuracy measure is only available for methods that support multi-bit watermarks.
