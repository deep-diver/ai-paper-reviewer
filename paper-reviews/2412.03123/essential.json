Many existing techniques are vulnerable to attacks such as word substitutions or sentence paraphrasing,  limiting their practical applicability. They may also have low bit-rate, limiting the amount of information that can be embedded.  Additionally, the reliance on lexical-based methods makes them susceptible to synonym replacement, compromising the effectiveness of the watermark. \nThis research introduces a novel approach to text watermarking using Large Language Models (LLMs).  The core idea is to embed the watermark by using two fine-tuned LLM paraphrasers alternatively. The alternative paraphrasing creates subtle differences in the text semantics that a trained classifier can effectively detect.  This technique offers significant improvements in robustness against various attacks, including word substitutions and sentence paraphrasing, demonstrating high accuracy (over 99.99% detection AUC) even under perturbations. The method's ability to embed multi-bit watermarks further enhances its information capacity.", "affiliation": "ByteDance Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.03123/podcast.wav"}
