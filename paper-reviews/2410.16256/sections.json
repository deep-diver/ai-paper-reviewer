It highlights the existing dichotomy in LLM evaluation methods, namely objective and subjective evaluations.  Objective evaluation, relying on ground truth answers, is deemed insufficient because it overlooks crucial aspects of real-world LLM usage like helpfulness, honesty, and creativity. Subjective evaluation, while aligning better with human perception, suffers from drawbacks such as high cost and reproducibility challenges.  These limitations underscore the urgent need for reliable, automated evaluation, paving the way for the introduction of CompassJudger-1, the paper's main contribution. The introduction also touches upon the limited availability of transparent and affordable open-source judge models, and the need for a new benchmark capable of thoroughly evaluating these models.

It emphasizes the high cost and reproducibility issues associated with human-based subjective evaluation, while highlighting the inadequacy of rule-based objective evaluation for capturing nuanced aspects of LLM performance relevant to real-world applications.

The model's training involved a three-category data collection process:  publicly available judge data, self-collected subjective evaluation data, and reward data. The data was highly imbalanced, necessitating several data filtering and sampling strategies, including balance sampling to ensure representation across categories and to mitigate the risk of rigid model response patterns.  The authors also investigated the influence of general SFT (G-SFT) data, ultimately establishing an optimal training ratio of critique data:reward data:general SFT data as 1:3:1, resulting in a final training dataset of approximately 900k entries.
