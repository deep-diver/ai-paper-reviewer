It categorizes LLM evaluation methods into two primary types: objective and subjective. Objective evaluations, which rely on ground-truth answers, are contrasted with subjective evaluations that assess qualities like helpfulness, honesty, and creativity, requiring human judgment. The section emphasizes the drawbacks of human-based subjective evaluation, such as high cost and lack of reproducibility.  It points out the rising popularity of subjective evaluation because of its better alignment with real-world scenarios and user preferences.  The need for automated, reproducible subjective evaluation methods, which necessitates precise automated evaluators, is established as a key motivator for the research presented in the paper. This leads to the introduction of CompassJudger-1, the first open-source all-in-one judge LLM, which addresses these needs and is discussed in detail in later sections. The introduction also highlights the current state of research, mentioning several existing subjective benchmarks and the limitations of current judge models, which are often limited by their specific training tasks, lack flexibility, or are proprietary and expensive.", "first_cons": "The introduction does not explicitly state the limitations of current open-source judge LLMs beyond the fact that many only adhere to certain formats, lacking a more detailed quantitative or qualitative comparison or analysis of existing alternatives.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly and concisely defines the two main categories of LLM evaluation (objective and subjective), highlighting the advantages and disadvantages of each.

The authors highlight the growing importance of subjective evaluation due to its closer alignment with real-world use cases and user preferences. This leads to the introduction of CompassJudger-1, an open-source all-in-one judge LLM designed to overcome the limitations of existing models and promote more efficient and reproducible evaluation.  The introduction concludes by noting that current judge LLMs often lack generalizability and flexibility, or are proprietary and expensive, establishing the context and significance of the research."}}, {"page_end_idx": 4, "page_start_idx": 2, "section_number": 2, "section_title": "CompassJudger-1", "details": {"details": "CompassJudger-1 is an all-in-one judge LLM trained on a diverse dataset to excel in various subjective evaluation tasks and general tasks.
