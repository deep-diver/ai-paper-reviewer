It excels at various tasks including providing scores, comparing models, generating critiques, and performing general LLM tasks. To ensure a unified evaluation, researchers also created JudgerBench, a new benchmark covering diverse subjective evaluation tasks.  The results demonstrate CompassJudger-1's superior performance and versatility compared to existing models. By open-sourcing both the model and the benchmark, this research aims to accelerate advancements in LLM evaluation."}
