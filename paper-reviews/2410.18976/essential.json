It includes over 29,000 questions spanning eight diverse domains such as image recognition, video understanding, and document processing.  Testing several LLMs (both open-source and closed-source), the study found that even top-performing models struggled to achieve high accuracy, particularly in complex tasks. This highlights a substantial need for further research and development in building Arabic LLMs that can accurately and reliably handle various tasks and scenarios. The CAMEL-Bench dataset and evaluation tools are publicly available, encouraging researchers to contribute to improving Arabic LLM performance."}
