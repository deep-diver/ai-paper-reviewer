Current models also neglect fine details and textures, and there's a lack of suitable datasets for training and evaluation. Thus the paper addresses the above issues in this research.\n\nThis paper presents a novel framework which is called **Diffusion-4K** for synthesizing 4K images. It includes **Aesthetic-4K** which is a high-quality 4K image dataset. To evaluate the fine details, it also introduces **GLCM Score** and **Compression Ratio metrics**, combined with existing measures like FID. Furthermore, it introduces a wavelet-based fine-tuning approach for photorealistic image training. As a result, the approach achieves impressive performance and has high text prompt adherence.", "affiliation": "Beihang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18352/podcast.wav"}
