Unlike previous methods that relied on prompting techniques or external solvers, FLARE uses the LLM to plan a solution, translate the query into Prolog code (a logic programming language), and then simulate code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search. This approach allows for measuring the faithfulness of the reasoning process and identifying model inconsistencies (hallucinations).  Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that FLARE achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming existing methods.  Model faithfulness is positively correlated with overall performance.  Importantly, FLARE allows researchers to pinpoint the decisive factors that contribute to the model's success or failure in solving reasoning tasks. This method offers a more transparent and reliable approach to complex reasoning with LLMs, opening up new avenues for research in interpretability and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in handling complex, nuanced reasoning problems."}
