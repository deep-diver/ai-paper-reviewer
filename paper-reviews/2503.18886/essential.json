{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it **improves flow matching models** which are now becoming more common in text-to-image generation. By providing a more effective and stable guidance method, this research can **push the boundaries of generative modeling** and its applications, also providing a clearer picture of the issues with current methods.", "summary": "CFG-Zero*: A better Classifier-Free Guidance to improve the image quality and text alignment in Flow Matching models.", "takeaways": ["CFG can cause issues for flow estimation in early stages of training.", "Optimized scale and zero-init can improve the CFG for flow matching models, forming CFG-Zero*.", "CFG-Zero* method shows competitive performance in text-to-image and video generation."], "tldr": "Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique in diffusion and flow models to enhance image quality and controllability. However, it has limitations in flow matching models, especially during early training stages when flow estimation is inaccurate. In such cases, CFG can lead samples toward incorrect trajectories, affecting the quality of generated images. The paper hypothesizes that the mismatch arises from dataset limitations and learning limitations.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces CFG-Zero*, which includes (a) an optimized scale, where a scalar is optimized to correct for inaccuracies in the estimated velocity; and (b) zero-init, which involves zeroing out the first few steps of the ODE solver. Through experiments in text-to-image and video generation, CFG-Zero* is proven to outperform CFG. The study also provides insights into error sources in flow-matching models.", "affiliation": "S-Lab, Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18886/podcast.wav"}
