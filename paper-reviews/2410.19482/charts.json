We plot the rank of the target suffix tokens over each successive token that is decoded by greedy and top-k sampling. At every index except one, the tokens in the target sequence have rank 1. At index 15, the target token has rank 2, which means greedy sampling does not select this token, and after which the generated sequence diverges from the target. If, at index 15, the second most likely token had been selected instead, then the remaining positions all have the target token as the top ranked token, so a probabilistic sampling scheme like top-k sampling has a high likelihood of generating the target suffix. See Figure 11a in Appendix E for the specific generated and target text for this example.", "description": "The chart compares the rank of target tokens in the predicted probability distribution for greedy and top-k sampling, showing how greedy sampling can miss clear memorization instances that top-k sampling would detect.", "section": "Capturing instances of one-shot extraction that greedy sampling misses"}, {"figure_path": "2410.19482/charts/charts_16_3.png", "caption": "Figure 12 | (n, p)-discoverable extraction for different (Pythia) model sizes using top-k = 40 sampling.", "description": "(n,p)-discoverable extraction for different Pythia model sizes using top-k=40 sampling is shown, demonstrating how the extraction rate varies with the number of trials (n), probability (p), and model size.", "section": "5.
