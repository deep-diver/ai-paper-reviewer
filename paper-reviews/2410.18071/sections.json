It points out a critical deficiency in existing MLLM evaluation benchmarks:  their susceptibility to prompt sensitivity.  Small changes in the phrasing of prompts can lead to significant variations in model performance, potentially obscuring the models' true capabilities and introducing bias.  The authors illustrate this with an example from the MMT-Bench benchmark where a simple rephrasing of a prompt drastically alters a model's accuracy (from near 0% to approximately 50%).  This variability necessitates a more robust and reliable evaluation method, which motivates the introduction of their proposed framework, TP-Eval, for customizing prompts to better evaluate MLLM performance. The framework aims to address the bias and unreliability stemming from using the same prompt across various models by generating customized prompts for each model, thereby uncovering the model's true potential.", "first_cons": "The introduction primarily focuses on the problem of prompt sensitivity without offering concrete solutions or a detailed overview of the proposed TP-Eval framework.

Minor changes in question phrasing can lead to substantial performance fluctuations, potentially masking the models' true capabilities and creating bias in comparisons.  The analysis highlights this issue through examples, such as a task where a simple prompt change doubled the accuracy of one model.  This inconsistent performance is exacerbated by the use of uniform prompts across all models within a benchmark, further distorting the evaluation.  The authors argue that existing benchmarks often underestimate models' true potential due to this prompt sensitivity and lack of model-specific prompt optimization, ultimately undermining the reliability and comparability of evaluation results. The evaluation bias is further demonstrated using two different models, LLaVA and DeepSeek, showing how similar changes in prompts yield very different impacts on accuracy.

It starts with an initial prompt and uses a two-stage process: a scorer and an optimizer. The scorer uses GPT-40 mini as an optimizer (Mo) and answer analyzer (MA) to evaluate generated prompts, calculating scores based on accuracy and semantic similarity to the original prompt.  A novel \"introspection\" mechanism helps the optimizer understand why certain prompts are wrong.  The optimizer (GPT-40 mini) uses this information, plus a few examples and a meta-prompt, to generate new prompts in an iterative process.  The process continues until a satisfactory prompt is found.  A key innovation is handling the limited data typical of MLLM benchmarks; the method incorporates strategies to prevent overfitting and maintain the original prompt's semantic meaning, using a weighting coefficient (\u03b1) to balance accuracy and semantic similarity.  The selection of the optimal prompt is achieved by using a higher weighting (\u03b1*) for the final computation. The method is described in detail using a flow diagram and explanations of each step.
