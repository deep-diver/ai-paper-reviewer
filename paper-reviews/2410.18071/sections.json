Minor prompt variations lead to substantial performance fluctuations, potentially underestimating models' true capabilities.  This is exacerbated by the use of uniform prompts across all models, introducing evaluation bias.  The analysis highlights the inadequacy of current benchmarks in accurately capturing models' strengths and weaknesses due to this prompt sensitivity and bias, showing examples where a simple prompt change can dramatically alter model performance, like the example showing a model's accuracy shifting from extremely low to nearly double with a minor prompt modification.  The analysis uses specific examples from the MMT-Bench benchmark, demonstrating a case where a model incorrectly answers 'yes' to all questions in a task using the original prompt, but achieves near-perfect accuracy after a slight rephrasing. This highlights that existing benchmarks can significantly underestimate the true performance of MLLMs due to the use of simple and unoptimized prompts.  It further argues that different models have different sensitivities to prompts, and using uniform prompts across all models introduces significant bias and prevents fair model comparisons. The lack of consideration for these prompt-induced effects in existing benchmarks results in an unreliable and incomplete evaluation of MLLM capabilities.", "first_cons": "Existing MLLM evaluation benchmarks are unreliable due to their failure to account for prompt sensitivity, leading to underestimation of model capabilities and biased comparisons.", "first_pros": "The analysis clearly identifies the significant problem of prompt sensitivity in existing MLLM evaluation benchmarks, providing concrete examples to support the claims.", "keypoints": ["Minor prompt variations cause significant performance fluctuations (e.g., a model's accuracy nearly doubles with a simple prompt rephrase).", "Uniform prompts across different models lead to evaluation bias and unfair comparisons.", "Existing benchmarks often underestimate models' true capabilities due to inappropriate prompts.", "Different models exhibit varying sensitivities to prompt changes, making uniform prompts unsuitable for fair evaluation.", "The analysis demonstrates the negative impacts of prompt insensitivity using concrete examples and data from the MMT-Bench benchmark (e.g., a model answering 'yes' to all questions in a task due to prompt issues)."], "second_cons": "The analysis focuses primarily on identifying the problem of prompt sensitivity rather than offering concrete solutions within the section; the proposed solution is introduced in the next section.", "second_pros": "The analysis is well-supported by concrete examples and data from existing benchmarks, making the arguments convincing and easy to understand.

This sensitivity, previously well-documented for LLMs (with references to Zhan et al.'s work from 2022, 2023, and 2024), is emphasized for MLLMs as well, implying similar issues with prompt engineering for multimodal models.  The lack of consideration for prompt sensitivity in existing benchmarks is noted as a critical deficiency, leading to underestimations of model capabilities.\n\n- **Prompt Optimization Techniques:** The core of the section focuses on existing techniques for automatic prompt optimization, particularly comparing and contrasting continuous and discrete methods.  Continuous methods optimize within the embedding space of LLMs, using gradient-based approaches, while discrete methods directly manipulate natural language prompts using reinforcement learning or editing.  Recent research utilizing LLMs as prompt optimizers is also mentioned, emphasizing innovative approaches like evolutionary algorithms or gradient-based methods inspired by traditional model optimization techniques.\n\n- **Limitations of Existing Methods:** The section acknowledges the limitations of existing prompt optimization methods when applied to MLLMs. These limitations include the smaller dataset sizes typically associated with MLLM benchmarks (creating issues with overfitting). The methods often neglect the visual aspects of MLLM prompts (focusing primarily on text), and the computational cost associated with iteratively calling MLLM APIs is often prohibitive.   This section highlights the need for specialized optimization methods better suited to the challenges posed by MLLM evaluation.\n\n- **The Need for Specialized MLLM Techniques:**  The section concludes by emphasizing the need for new approaches specifically tailored for MLLM prompt optimization that addresses the previously discussed limitations.

The optimizer, also a GPT-40 mini model, generates new prompts based on the scorer's feedback, aiming to improve performance while maintaining semantic coherence.  The process iteratively refines the prompts until an optimal prompt is selected.  A crucial aspect is the use of 'introspection' \u2013 an analysis of the model's errors on a subset of the data \u2013 to provide the optimizer with more informative feedback, thus improving the quality of generated prompts.
