Existing benchmarks often use the same question for all models, leading to unfair comparisons and underestimation of some models' abilities.  This paper introduces TP-Eval, a new framework that customizes questions for each model to reveal their full potential. TP-Eval uses an automated process to create optimal questions by generating multiple versions and evaluating them based on accuracy and avoiding drastic semantic changes. Experiments show that TP-Eval effectively reduces bias and reveals previously unseen model capabilities.  It's particularly useful for scenarios with limited data, a common issue in multimodal evaluation.  The method even extends to zero-shot settings.  Overall, TP-Eval offers a more comprehensive and reliable way to assess MLLMs, leading to fairer comparisons and a better understanding of their strengths and weaknesses."}
