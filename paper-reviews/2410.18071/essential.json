{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on multimodal large language models (MLLMs). It addresses the critical issue of prompt sensitivity in MLLM evaluation, which often leads to underestimation of model capabilities.  The proposed TP-Eval framework offers a novel solution by customizing prompts for individual models, thus enabling more accurate and reliable evaluation. This work is highly relevant to current trends in AI research and opens up new avenues for improving MLLM benchmarks and enhancing the overall development of these powerful models.", "summary": "TP-Eval, a novel framework, tackles MLLM evaluation bias by customizing prompts for each model, revealing true capabilities and improving benchmark reliability.", "takeaways": ["Existing MLLM benchmarks suffer from prompt sensitivity, leading to underestimation of model performance.", "TP-Eval introduces a prompt customization method to mitigate evaluation bias and reveal models' true potential.", "Experiments demonstrate TP-Eval's effectiveness in improving MLLM evaluation accuracy and uncovering hidden model capabilities."], "tldr": "Many existing benchmarks for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are flawed because small changes to the prompts used to ask the models questions can cause large changes in their performance. This makes it difficult to get a true measure of how good the models are.  This paper introduces a new evaluation method called TP-Eval that solves this problem. TP-Eval works by automatically creating customized prompts for each MLLM. The method uses an iterative approach to find the best prompt for each model by making small changes to the original prompt and then seeing how the model performs. This approach significantly improved the evaluation scores for several different models, showing that the original benchmarks were significantly underestimating their true capabilities.  The findings highlight the importance of considering prompt sensitivity when evaluating MLLMs and suggest that future benchmarks should incorporate methods like TP-Eval to get a more accurate assessment of model performance."}
