This paper introduces TP-Eval, a novel evaluation framework that addresses this by customizing prompts for each model. TP-Eval employs an automated prompt optimization method tailored to the specific characteristics of MLLMs.  The method uses a combination of techniques, including an optimizer-scorer architecture, to generate improved prompts. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TP-Eval in revealing the true capabilities of various MLLMs on several benchmark datasets.  The improved accuracy and reduced bias from TP-Eval make it a valuable contribution to the field, enabling researchers to more accurately compare and evaluate the performance of different MLLMs."}
