These models are difficult to train and can suffer from issues such as 3D inconsistency and imperfect stitching for long videos.  This limitation motivates the need for more efficient and accurate approaches.  Existing single-image depth estimators, while highly accurate for single frames, often struggle to maintain temporal consistency when applied to video sequences due to motion and changes in depth range.\nThe proposed RollingDepth model addresses these challenges by cleverly leveraging a single-image latent diffusion model (LDM). It processes short video snippets (typically frame triplets) with a multi-frame depth estimator to capture temporal context.  A robust optimization-based registration algorithm then optimally assembles these depth snippets into a long, temporally coherent depth video. This approach provides **significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency** compared to dedicated video depth estimators and single-frame models, even on long videos. The model's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on standard video depth estimation benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2411.19189/podcast.wav"}
