The datasets vary in video sequence length (indicated in parentheses), allowing for evaluation of the models' abilities to handle both short and long videos.  Performance is measured using two metrics: absolute relative error (Abs Rel) and \u03b41 accuracy.  Lower Abs Rel values and higher \u03b41 values indicate better performance.  The table highlights RollingDepth's superior performance across all datasets and sequence lengths, which is particularly noteworthy given that RollingDepth is an image-based model, unlike many of the baseline methods which are specifically designed for video data.", "section": "4.
