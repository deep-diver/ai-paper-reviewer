Unlike previous datasets, CCI3.0-HQ utilizes a two-stage filtering process. The first stage involves standard data cleaning techniques. The second stage leverages a powerful LLM (Qwen2-72B-Instruct) to identify and select high-quality data samples, resulting in a much cleaner dataset. Experiments show that models trained on CCI3.0-HQ significantly outperform those trained on existing Chinese datasets like SkyPile and WanjuanV1, across various benchmark tests.  This improvement highlights the importance of high-quality data in LLM training. The new dataset and associated classifier are open-source, promoting broader accessibility and further research in the field."}
