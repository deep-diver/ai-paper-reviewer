The dataset is a 500GB subset of the Chinese Corpora Internet 3.0 (CCI3.0), carefully refined using a two-stage filtering process.  The first stage involves standard data cleaning and quality assessment. The second stage uses a more sophisticated approach involving a 0.5B parameter model trained to identify high-quality samples. This process results in a dataset that is substantially better than existing open-source Chinese datasets. Experiments show that training LLMs on this refined data leads to improved zero-shot performance on a range of benchmarks compared to other similar datasets.  The paper also introduces a new quality classifier tool, making the improvements achieved reproducible. The researchers believe that CCI3.0-HQ will help further the development of better Chinese LLMs by addressing the scarcity of high-quality training data currently available."}
