Open-source datasets like The Pile (825GB) and Common Crawl have significantly advanced LLM development. The trend is toward even larger datasets (over 10 trillion tokens) and improved data quality, with a shift from rule-based to model-driven filtering methods.  However, Chinese language datasets lag significantly behind English resources in both size and quality. Existing Chinese datasets such as WuDao, SkyPile150B, and WanjuanV1 are limited in scale and suffer from suboptimal quality due to challenges in data sourcing and effective filtering.  This lack of high-quality data significantly hinders the development of robust Chinese language models, hence the need for improved data curation and filtering techniques.", "first_cons": "The significant disparity in size and quality between available English and Chinese language datasets is a major obstacle to advancing Chinese LLM development.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly highlights the crucial role of high-quality pre-training data in the success of LLMs, setting the stage for the paper's contribution.", "keypoints": ["The success of LLMs is strongly linked to the availability of high-quality pre-training data.", "Open-source datasets like The Pile (825GB) and Common Crawl have been vital, but the demand now exceeds 10 trillion tokens.", "There's a shift towards model-driven data filtering techniques for improved quality.", "Chinese language datasets are significantly under-represented compared to English resources, lacking both scale and quality in currently available open-source options.", "The scarcity of high-quality Chinese data presents a substantial barrier to developing high-performing Chinese LLMs, creating a critical need for advanced data filtering and quality classification methods."], "second_cons": "The introduction focuses primarily on the problem without providing concrete examples of the shortcomings of existing Chinese datasets beyond stating that they have suboptimal quality.", "second_pros": "The authors effectively establish the context and motivation for their work by highlighting the critical need for high-quality, large-scale Chinese datasets for training advanced LLMs.", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) rely heavily on high-quality pre-training data.

Fundamental Processing involves four steps: Safety Filtering (removing unsafe content), Text Extraction and Cleaning (extracting and cleaning text from diverse sources using specialized parsers), Document-Level De-Duplication (removing near-duplicates using global MinHash), and Heuristic and Basic Quality Filtering (applying heuristics and a basic quality classifier to filter out low-quality documents based on reliable sources). This stage produces the CCI3.0 dataset.  High-Quality Processing focuses on refining the CCI3.0 dataset using Qwen2-72B-Instruct to identify high-quality samples (resulting in 140k training samples and 14k testing samples).  A 0.5B quality classifier is trained on these annotated samples to efficiently filter the remaining data, producing the final high-quality CCI3.0-HQ dataset. This classifier demonstrates approximately 80% agreement with GPT-4 annotations. The process efficiently distills the capabilities of the Qwen2-72B-instruct model into a compact 0.5B model, greatly enhancing the efficiency of the filtering process.", "first_cons": "The description of the heuristic and basic quality filtering methods is somewhat vague, lacking specific details on how the heuristics are defined and how the classifier is trained or selected.

The first stage, Fundamental Processing, uses standard web data curation techniques, while the second stage, High-Quality Processing, leverages a large language model (Qwen2-72B-Instruct) to further refine the dataset, resulting in CCI3.0-HQ. This dataset, which includes 140k training samples and 14k testing samples, is then used to train a smaller quality classifier for efficient filtering. The result is a high-quality 500GB dataset that significantly enhances data integrity for pre-training large language models (LLMs).  The pipeline combines rule-based and model-driven filtering to achieve superior results compared to existing datasets. The 0.5B parameter quality classifier achieves an ~80% agreement rate with GPT-4 annotation results, enhancing the efficiency of this step in the process.  The methodology highlights a balance of algorithmic techniques and model-driven filtering for effective results at scale.
