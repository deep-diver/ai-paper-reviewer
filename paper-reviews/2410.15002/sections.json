The approach leverages observational data, specifically the frequency of concepts (e.g., art styles, human faces) within a pre-trained model's dataset, and their associated imitation scores.  The imitation score measures how well the model replicates the concept in generated images compared to its training data.  This comparison uses domain-specific image embedders to compute similarity, which addresses limitations of general-purpose image similarity methods for nuanced concepts. To efficiently determine the frequencies of concepts within the training dataset, MIMETIC2 uses a reverse index to find images with captions that mention the concept of interest, followed by a classifier to filter out images lacking the concept.  By sorting the concepts in ascending order of their frequency, and applying a change detection algorithm, the method estimates the imitation threshold.  The process is described in three steps: First, estimating concept frequency; Second, computing imitation score; and Third, applying a change detection algorithm.  The method involves several assumptions, namely distributional invariance between concepts in a domain, absence of confounders between imitation scores and concept frequency, and equal contribution of each concept image to the learning process.", "first_cons": "The methodology relies on several assumptions that may not always hold true in real-world scenarios.
