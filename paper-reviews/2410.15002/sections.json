The section introduces this problem as \"Finding the Imitation Threshold\" (FIT). The authors acknowledge that the ideal approach for finding this threshold would involve training multiple models on datasets with varying numbers of the concept's images, then measuring the model's ability to generate recognizable imitations.  However, this optimal approach is deemed computationally prohibitive due to the extreme cost of training large text-to-image models (estimated at \\$10 million for a single experiment involving 100,000 images). As a result, the section proposes an alternative, more practical approach called MIMETIC2, which estimates the threshold using observational data rather than requiring extensive model training. This approach leverages existing trained models and avoids the immense computational expense. The section concludes by laying the foundation for the rest of the paper, explaining how MIMETIC2 will proceed to estimate this threshold.", "first_cons": "The proposed MIMETIC2 approach relies on several assumptions, such as distributional invariance between concepts within a domain and the equal contribution of each training image to the model's learning of a concept.

It leverages observational data, specifically the frequency of concepts in a pre-trained model's dataset and the model's ability to imitate those concepts.  The process begins by estimating concept frequency.  This is achieved through a two-step process: First, using a search tool to retrieve images with captions containing the target concept; and second, employing a classifier to filter out images where the concept is not actually present. This step carefully addresses potential biases in simple caption-based frequency estimation, such as the fact that only 60% of images whose caption mentions a concept actually include that concept.  Then, the model's imitation score for each concept is evaluated by comparing generated images to their corresponding training images using domain-specific embedding models (for both faces and art styles).  This step uses domain-specific similarity measurement techniques, recognizing that general methods might struggle with the nuances of fine-grained concepts like specific human faces or artistic styles. Finally, the concepts are sorted by increasing frequency, and a change detection algorithm, PELT, is used to identify the point where the imitation score significantly changes.

These outliers are instances where the imitation score doesn't align with the expected trend based on the concept's image frequency.  Two main outlier categories are identified:  \n\n**Category 1:** Low image counts but high imitation scores. These cases are often explained by aliases or multiple names for the same concept (e.g., Thandiwe Newton also being known as Thandie Newton, leading to an underestimation of her total image count by MIMETIC2).  This results in higher imitation scores than expected because the algorithm only counted images where the primary name was used in the caption. The true image counts significantly exceed the threshold, thus resolving the anomaly.  Examples cited include Belle Delphine (true count of 704 vs. MIMETIC2 count of 394) and DJ Kool Herc (true count of 761 vs. MIMETIC2 count of 492).\n\n**Category 2:** High image counts but low imitation scores.
