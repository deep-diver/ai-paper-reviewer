[{"heading_title": "Unified RAG Framework", "details": {"summary": "A **unified RAG framework** integrates retrieval and generation within a single model. This approach offers several advantages over traditional RAG methods that use separate retriever and generator components.  It enables **joint optimization** of retrieval and generation, leading to improved performance and deeper understanding of their interaction.  A unified framework also **reduces deployment costs** by eliminating the need for maintaining a separate retrieval model and its associated index. It allows for **dynamic retrieval granularity**, enabling the model to decide how much evidence to retrieve based on the query's complexity. Furthermore, direct evidence generation within the unified framework avoids the inclusion of full retrieved documents as input, thus **reducing input token length** and mitigating distraction from redundant information.  However, such frameworks necessitate addressing challenges like **false pruning** during constrained evidence generation. This can be mitigated via techniques like hierarchical constraints and forward-looking decoding to improve accuracy and efficiency."}}, {"heading_title": "Constrained Decoding", "details": {"summary": "**Constrained decoding** in LLMs directs text generation by enforcing rules or limitations.  This is crucial for controlling output, ensuring factual accuracy by grounding generation in external knowledge, and generating text adhering to specific formats or structures.  However, **overly strict constraints** risk **false pruning**, where valid generation paths are prematurely eliminated, hindering output quality.  Balancing constraint strictness with generation flexibility is key for effective constrained decoding."}}, {"heading_title": "Hierarchical FM-Index", "details": {"summary": "**RetroLLM** introduces a hierarchical FM-Index to enhance retrieval accuracy and efficiency.  It constructs two indexes: a **global** index on the entire corpus for initial clue generation and **document-level** indexes for precise evidence extraction. This two-tiered approach allows for broad initial searching, constrained by the corpus's global FM-Index, to identify relevant documents. Subsequently, the document-specific FM-Indexes allow for granular evidence generation, reducing irrelevant decoding. This hierarchical structure addresses the challenge of false pruning in constrained decoding by first narrowing down the search space with clue generation. This two-stage retrieval within generation method enhances both accuracy and efficiency."}}, {"heading_title": "Forward-Looking Decoding", "details": {"summary": "**Forward-looking decoding** enhances evidence generation by enabling the model to consider future context.  It identifies potential future windows containing clues, scores their relevance to the query, and adjusts decoding probabilities accordingly.  This **mitigates false pruning** in constrained decoding by favoring tokens leading to relevant future windows, thus improving the generation of coherent and accurate evidence."}}, {"heading_title": "Retrieval Accuracy, Efficiency", "details": {"summary": "**RetroLLM effectively balances retrieval accuracy and efficiency.**  It demonstrates superior R@1 compared to other methods in single-hop QA, and outperforms all methods in multi-hop QA while retrieving fewer passages. Although slightly slower than naive RAG, its reduced token consumption (approximately 2.1x less than naive RAG and 6x less than Iter-RetGen) makes it more efficient overall. This is because RetroLLM retrieves fine-grained evidence and dynamically adjusts the amount retrieved, optimizing the trade-off between sufficient information and conciseness for LLM processing."}}]
