The process begins by presenting the model with word stimuli representing group categories (e.g., men, women) and attribute categories (e.g., career, family).  Next, condition-specific instructions are given, defining whether the pairings should be association-compatible (stereotypical pairings) or association-incompatible (non-stereotypical pairings). Following the instructions, a writing prompt is presented to the model. Finally, the number of reasoning tokens used by the model to complete the task is compared between the association-compatible and association-incompatible conditions to reveal potential implicit bias.", "section": "2 Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.11572/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparison of token counts between conditions for all 10 RM-IATs. Error bars represent standard error around the mean. Except for the Mental/Physical Diseases + Temporary/Permanent RM-IAT, o3-mini consistently used more reasoning tokens in the association-incompatible condition than the association-compatible condition.", "description": "Figure 2 presents a visual comparison of the number of reasoning tokens used by the OpenAI's 03-mini language model across ten different Implicit Association Tests (RM-IATs).  Each RM-IAT explores different pairings of concepts (e.g., Flowers/Insects with Pleasant/Unpleasant words, Men/Women with Career/Family concepts). The graph displays the average number of tokens for both association-compatible and association-incompatible conditions in each RM-IAT. Error bars showcase the standard error around the mean, indicating variability in token counts. In nine out of ten RM-IATs, the model used significantly more reasoning tokens when processing association-incompatible information than association-compatible information. This pattern is consistent with observations of human implicit bias, suggesting a similar processing pattern in the model.", "section": "3 Results"}]
