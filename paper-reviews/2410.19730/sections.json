It emphasizes the inherent architectural limitations of Transformers, the backbone of modern large language models (LLMs), which restrict them to constant-depth computation, making them theoretically incapable of solving tasks requiring increasingly deep reasoning as input length grows. Counting, being inherently inductive and requiring linearly increasing depth, poses a significant challenge for Transformers.  While previous studies have explored the counting abilities of specialized models trained for this specific task, this paper focuses on the impact of tokenization on general-purpose LLMs, which often use byte-pair encoding (BPE), a method that fundamentally alters how reasoning is processed compared to character-level tokenization used in specialized models. The authors highlight the lack of research focusing on the role of tokenization in the counting abilities of LLMs, emphasizing the need for investigation into how it can undermine the models' theoretical computability.

Early attempts with Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) failed due to their inability to handle variable-length inputs, inherent in counting problems. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), particularly LSTMs, demonstrated improved performance, capable of dynamically maintaining counters through memory mechanisms and achieving success rates of up to 8% for regular language recognition tasks. However, the theoretical analysis of neural network computability revealed that Transformers, unlike RNNs, are theoretically incapable of solving counting tasks due to their constant depth computation limitation. This inherent architectural constraint prevents them from performing inductive reasoning, which is fundamental to counting.  Prior research has thoroughly investigated the computability of different neural network architectures, showing that counting tasks demand deeper computation steps that grow linearly with input length, a requirement not easily met by Transformers.

The core argument revolves around the inductive nature of counting, which requires sequential processing of information, a process that is fundamentally challenging for the constant-depth architecture of Transformers.  Unlike recurrent neural networks (RNNs) with their recurrent connections, Transformers cannot inherently update a counter across multiple steps.  The section explains that under ideal conditions, where CoT steps can be extended indefinitely, LLMs could in principle achieve perfect counting accuracy.  However, this 'ideal' condition is not achievable in real-world scenarios due to limitations in CoT reasoning and the inherent constraints of the Transformer architecture. The authors introduce the concept of inductive counting, contrasting it with the parallel processing capabilities of Transformers and highlighting the sequential nature of counting through the use of state machines and recurrent neural networks as examples. The core idea is that a simple counter needs to increment sequentially, and this is achievable only with the help of mechanisms like CoT to circumvent the limitations of the Transformer's fixed-layer architecture.

The authors introduce the concept of *Token Awareness*, highlighting that LLMs may not fully understand the internal composition of BPE tokens (e.g., how many 'a's are in a token).  To study this effect without direct access to the model's tokenizer (since many LLMs are closed-source), they employ a model-agnostic approach. They manipulate input string formatting in four ways: (a) pure string, (b) using '-' as delimiters, (c) using \",\" as delimiters, and (d) using quotes to separate characters into individual tokens.  By observing the LLM's performance on counting tasks with these different formatting styles, they analyze the impact of tokenization on counting accuracy.  Experiments show that using delimiters to create more granular tokens significantly improves counting accuracy, sometimes from as low as 9% to over 90%, depending on the model and the type of tokenization.
