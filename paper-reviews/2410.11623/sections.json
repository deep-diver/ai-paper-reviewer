These tasks are designed to be interconnected and complementary, assessing various aspects of an embodied AI agent's understanding and interaction with its environment.  The tasks include:\n\n1. **Video Question Answering (VQA):** This assesses the model's ability to answer questions about egocentric videos, focusing on temporal reasoning and understanding of objects, actions, and scenes. The questions are designed to be more complex than simple existence queries, requiring the model to understand temporal relationships and interactions between different elements. Six dimensions are explored for objects (existence, order, interaction, count, state, prediction), three for actions (existence, sequence, count), and three for scenes (existence, transition, prediction). An open-ended question-answering format is adopted to promote more natural language generation.\n\n2. **Hierarchy Planning (HP):**  This task evaluates the model's ability to perform hierarchical planning, decomposing high-level goals into mid-level steps and low-level actions.  Two sub-tasks are included: high-level goal to mid-level step, and mid-level step to low-level action.  The model is required to generate free-text responses for mid-level steps and sequences of low-level actions, making it closer to real-world robotic control applications.\n\n3. **Visual Grounding (VG):** This task focuses on the model's ability to ground natural language queries in egocentric videos. Three subtasks are designed: object grounding (providing bounding boxes for queried objects), frame grounding (identifying specific frames that satisfy a given query), and temporal grounding (identifying time segments matching a given query). This task bridges the gap between high-level language understanding and low-level visual perception.\n\n4. **Reward Modeling (RM):** This task assesses the model's ability to function as a reward model, providing feedback on task completion status and generating reasons for incompletion. Two sub-tasks are proposed: critique (binary classification of task completion) and feedback (generating text explanations of why a task is incomplete).  The goal is to evaluate if the model can provide useful feedback for guiding reinforcement learning agents.\n\nThe paper emphasizes the importance of automatic data generation methods using GPT-4 to reduce annotation costs, ensuring diversity and quality via human filtering.
