By cleverly transforming the view consistency issue into a problem of video consistency, it can restore view-consistent details and integrate them with the original 3DGS model.  The improved results make the 3DGS method far more robust and useful, especially in cases with limited data. Extensive experiments on large datasets show a huge increase in the quality of the generated images compared to existing techniques."}
