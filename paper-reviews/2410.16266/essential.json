"], "tldr": "The paper introduces 3DGS-Enhancer, a novel method to enhance the quality of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a technique for creating realistic 3D scenes from images.  3DGS can struggle with sparse input views (few images of the scene), resulting in poor quality renderings. 3DGS-Enhancer addresses this by creatively using 2D video diffusion models.  These models are good at generating temporally consistent (smoothly changing over time) video, and the paper cleverly adapts this ability to create spatially consistent (smoothly changing across viewpoints) 3D scenes. By training a video diffusion model on rendered views from an initial 3DGS model, 3DGS-Enhancer obtains enhanced, more consistent views that then fine-tune the initial 3DGS model. Experiments show substantial improvements in the quality of the generated 3D scenes compared to other methods, especially when starting with only a few input images."}
