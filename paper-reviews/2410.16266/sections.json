The review is structured around three main approaches: radiance fields for NVS, few-shot novel view synthesis, and the use of diffusion priors for NVS.\n\n**Radiance Fields for NVS:** The discussion begins by highlighting the advancements and limitations of radiance field methods like NeRFs.  NeRFs excel at producing photorealistic renderings but suffer from slow training and inference times.  Improvements such as Mip-NeRF and others focus on improving efficiency and quality, but the fundamental challenges remain.  The section then introduces 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) as a notable alternative that offers faster rendering times and competitive results. However, 3DGS still requires many high-quality input views, which is often unrealistic.\n\n**Few-Shot Novel View Synthesis:** This subsection details techniques that address the limitations of using many views. These methods use additional constraints (depth, normal, geometric constraints) to reconstruct 3D scenes from limited input, which can be sensitive to noise and overfitting issues.  A second category uses generative priors (such as those learned from large-scale datasets) to regularize the NVS pipeline; these methods also face consistency challenges when generated views are distant from the input views.\n\n**Diffusion Priors for Novel View Synthesis:** The review shifts to methods that leverage the power of diffusion models (LDMs) as priors for few-shot NVS.  The advantages of LDMs in image generation and restoration are noted, but the critical challenge highlighted is maintaining 3D view consistency among generated 2D images.  While some works try to address this with techniques like SDS loss, they don't fully solve the problem.  The text mentions several approaches embedding 3D awareness into 2D diffusion models or employing video diffusion models for few-shot NVS, each with its own limitations.", "first_cons": "The review lacks a quantitative comparison of the different methods discussed, making it difficult to objectively assess their relative strengths and weaknesses.", "first_pros": "The review provides a well-structured overview of different approaches to NVS enhancement, categorizing them into three distinct approaches.", "keypoints": ["Radiance fields methods (NeRFs) are high-quality but computationally expensive. 3DGS is a faster alternative but still needs many input views.", "Few-shot methods attempt to address the limitation of requiring many input views by employing extra geometric constraints or learning priors from large-scale datasets.

It examines three categories of techniques: radiance fields (NeRFs and 3DGS), few-shot NVS methods using geometric constraints or learned priors, and methods leveraging diffusion models.

It describes 3DGS as representing a scene using anisotropic 3D Gaussian spheres, each characterized by a center position (\u03bc \u2208 R\u00b3), a scaling factor (s \u2208 R\u00b3), and a rotation quaternion (q \u2208 R\u2074).

It takes low-quality novel views from an existing 3DGS model and enhances them using a video diffusion prior.  This process involves encoding latent features, restoring temporally consistent latent features with a video diffusion model, and integrating this information with original rendered views through a spatial-temporal decoder. Finally, these enhanced views are used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model for improved rendering quality.\n\n- **Video Diffusion Prior for Temporal Interpolation:** A pre-trained video diffusion model (like SVD) is used to enhance the consistency between generated 2D video frames and high-quality reference views.  This is framed as a video interpolation task where reference views serve as the first and last frames, guiding the restoration process.  The model incorporates cross-frame spatio-temporal attention and 3D residual convolution.  The objective is to minimize the difference between predicted noise and actual noise at each diffusion step.\n\n- **Spatial-Temporal Decoder:** This decoder improves upon a standard VAE decoder by incorporating temporal convolution layers to ensure temporal consistency, effectively integrating rendered views and adding conditional inputs to leverage the original rendered views' information.  It also includes a color correction step to address color shifts, normalizing with the reference view to maintain visual consistency.\n\n- **Confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting:** This technique uses image-level and pixel-level confidence to guide the fine-tuning of the 3DGS model.  Image-level confidence is based on the distance of the generated view to reference views; views farther from references get higher confidence.  Pixel-level confidence is calculated from the scaling vector of 3D Gaussian spheres; smaller volumes (indicating sharper features) get higher confidence.  This weighting helps balance the influence of reference and generated views during model refinement.  Overall, this fine-tuning process uses an L1 reconstruction loss, an LPIPS perceptual loss, and an adversarial loss for optimization.", "first_cons": "The method's reliance on a pre-trained video diffusion model introduces a dependency and limits its applicability if suitable pre-trained models are unavailable.
