It categorizes these methods into three main groups: radiance fields, few-shot NVS, and diffusion priors.\n\n**Radiance Fields:**  The section starts by discussing the evolution of radiance field methods, highlighting their strengths and limitations.  Radiance fields like NeRFs achieve high-fidelity results but suffer from lengthy training and inference times.  Subsequent advancements such as Mip-NeRF and 3DGS aimed at improving efficiency and quality. While 3DGS is efficient, rendering high-quality novel views from sparse viewpoints remains a challenge, prompting the need for enhancement methods.\n\n**Few-Shot NVS:**  To address the sparse-view challenge, many methods integrate additional geometric constraints (depth, normals) or leverage learned priors from multi-view stereo datasets.  However, these techniques often heavily rely on the accuracy of the additional information and can be sensitive to noise.  The section notes that while generating photorealistic novel views is possible, consistent view generation remains difficult when views are far from input views.\n\n**Diffusion Priors:** The use of diffusion models as priors for NVS is presented as a promising area.  The authors explain that LDMs have demonstrated powerful image generation and restoration capabilities.   The main challenge is the issue of 3D view consistency among generated 2D images. Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is mentioned as one attempt to address this; however, it falls short of generating high-fidelity 3D representations.\n\nThe section concludes by emphasizing the analogy between visual consistency in multi-view images and temporal consistency in video frames, suggesting that leveraging the power of video diffusion models can be beneficial in enhancing NVS.", "first_cons": "The section primarily focuses on the limitations of existing NVS methods, without providing a detailed analysis of the reasons behind their shortcomings.

It reformulates the challenging 3D view consistency problem as a temporal consistency problem within a video generation framework.  A video latent diffusion model (LDM) is used, which consists of an image encoder, a video-based diffusion model, and a spatial-temporal decoder. This model takes rendered novel views as input, restores temporally consistent latent features, and integrates this improved information with the original rendered views.  The enhanced views are then used to fine-tune the initial 3DGS model, leading to superior reconstruction performance.  Furthermore, a novel confidence-aware 3D Gaussian splatting strategy is introduced, which utilizes both image-level and pixel-level confidence maps to guide the fine-tuning process. Image-level confidence is based on distance to reference views, favoring distant views. Pixel-level confidence is based on the covariance of Gaussians in rendered pixels; higher covariance implies higher confidence.  These confidence measures selectively weight the contribution of enhanced views during fine-tuning. The optimization objective for the spatial-temporal decoder incorporates an L1 reconstruction loss, an LPIPS perceptual loss, and an adversarial loss.
