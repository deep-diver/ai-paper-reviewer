It starts with an intent (a high-level objective), which is translated into candidate policies by considering historical data and domain expertise.  These policies are then evaluated using a network analysis framework (like a Network Digital Twin), ranking them based on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and constraints. The best policy is selected and implemented, after which performance feedback is collected and used to refine the knowledge base, enabling continuous learning and enhancement.", "section": "II. LLMS AS KEY ENABLER FOR AUTONOMOUS NETWORKS"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.06490/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Architecture of the Hermes Framework.", "description": "The Hermes framework is composed of two main components: the Designer and the Coder.  The Designer is responsible for creating a blueprint for network modeling, which is a step-by-step logical plan that details how to build a Network Digital Twin (NDT). This blueprint is constructed through a multi-agent system involving coarse-grained and fine-grained generators that create initial reflections about the task, evaluators that refine those reflections, and a blueprint editor and refiner that optimize the blueprint for clarity and correctness. The Coder translates the refined blueprint into executable Python code. The entire process is iterative, with the Designer and Coder working together, and feedback loops providing iterative refinement.  The model repository stores the blueprint and code while the data repository provides the necessary data for evaluating the NDT.", "section": "III.

A blueprint is a structured, step-by-step plan detailing the logic for building a network digital twin (NDT). This blueprint uses a combination of operational blocks (e.g., updating transmit power) and functional blocks (e.g., calculating noise power).  Each block contains the code necessary to execute the specific task. The figure illustrates how Hermes breaks down a complex task into smaller, manageable steps which can be executed by the LLM's Coder component and verified using various components of the framework. The combination of logic within functional blocks, alongside the logical ordering of tasks, is crucial for accurately calculating network parameters such as SINR.", "section": "III.
