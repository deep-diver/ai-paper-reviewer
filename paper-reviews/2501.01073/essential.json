Many rely on adjacency matrices, which can be computationally expensive for large graphs and struggle with effectively representing complex relationships in data.  Others use auto-regressive frameworks that are often less expressive. This research addresses the inherent limitations by proposing a more efficient and flexible method.\nThe proposed method, named G2PT, utilizes a novel sequence-based graph representation, which greatly improves efficiency. This is coupled with the use of a transformer decoder for next-token prediction, leveraging the power of autoregressive modeling but avoiding its shortcomings. Experiments demonstrate that G2PT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various graph generation and prediction tasks, highlighting its flexibility and potential impact on various applications.", "affiliation": "Tufts University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Graph Representation Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2501.01073/podcast.wav"}
