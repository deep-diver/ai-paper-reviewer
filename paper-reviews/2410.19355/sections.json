This long inference time limits their practical application.

It begins by re-examining existing cache-based acceleration methods, revealing that the naive reuse of adjacent-step features results in a loss of subtle detail (Fig. 3(a)). The analysis then expands to explore the computational cost of Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG), identifying significant redundancy between conditional and unconditional outputs within the same timestep (Fig. 3(b)). This observation motivates the core of FasterCache, which comprises two key strategies: a dynamic feature reuse strategy for attention modules that adapts to feature variations across timesteps, and CFG-Cache, a novel technique to reuse conditional and unconditional outputs by dynamically optimizing the reuse of high and low-frequency components. The dynamic feature reuse strategy carefully balances distinction and continuity of features between adjacent timesteps, avoiding the detail loss observed in naive feature caching methods. CFG-Cache leverages the redundancy within CFG by selectively reusing components of the conditional and unconditional outputs, resulting in a significant acceleration without visual quality degradation. These strategies are illustrated in detail in the figures and equations provided in the section, culminating in an overall approach that greatly enhances video generation speed without compromising video quality.", "first_cons": "The methodology heavily relies on empirical observations and visualizations (e.g., Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7) rather than rigorous theoretical analysis.
