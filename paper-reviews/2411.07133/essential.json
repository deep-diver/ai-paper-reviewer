{"importance": "This paper challenges the common assumption that larger language models are better teachers for instruction tuning.  **It introduces a novel metric, Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR), to assess the effectiveness of different models as teachers, potentially improving the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of instruction tuning.**  This has significant implications for researchers and practitioners working with LLMs, guiding more informed choices in model selection for synthetic data generation.", "summary": "Larger language models aren't always better teachers for instruction tuning; a new metric, CAR, predicts teacher model effectiveness better than existing methods.", "takeaways": ["Larger language models are not always better teachers for instruction tuning.", "Existing metrics fail to capture the compatibility between teacher and student models.", "The proposed Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) metric significantly improves prediction of effective response generators without requiring fine-tuning"], "tldr": "Instruction tuning, crucial for aligning LLMs with user instructions, relies heavily on the quality of instruction datasets.  Creating these datasets is expensive and time-consuming.  Current methods often assume larger models are better response generators for creating synthetic datasets, using them as \"teachers\" for smaller models. However, this approach hasn't been rigorously evaluated. \nThis research investigates whether stronger models truly make better teachers for instruction tuning.  The authors challenge the existing assumption and find that larger models are not always superior. They introduce a novel metric called Compatibility-Adjusted Reward (CAR) to assess the effectiveness of different response generators (teacher models) in instruction tuning. The experiments reveal that CAR outperforms existing metrics in accurately predicting the effectiveness of teachers, thus providing a more effective and cost-efficient method to select them.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.07133/podcast.wav"}
