(a) When an occlusion occurs, SAM 2 may lose track or follow the wrong object, leading to accumulated errors. In contrast, SAM2Long utilizes memory tree search to recover when the object reappears. (b) The per-frame J&F scores of the predicted masks are plotted at specific timestamps on the LVOS and SA-V datasets. SAM2Long demonstrates greater resilience to elapsed time compared to SAM 2, maintaining superior performance over longer periods.", "description": "Figure 1 compares the performance of SAM2 and SAM2Long on handling occlusions and maintaining long-term tracking accuracy in video object segmentation, demonstrating SAM2Long's superior resilience.", "section": "1 INTRODUCTION"}, {"figure_path": "2410.16268/figures/figures_5_0.png", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) The pipeline of constrained memory tree: At each time step t, we maintain multiple memory pathways, each containing a memory bank and a cumulative score Sp[t]. The input frame is processed through the mask decoder conditioned on the memory bank, generating three mask candidates for each pathway. The candidates with the highest updated cumulative scores Sp,k[t] are carried forward to the next time step.
