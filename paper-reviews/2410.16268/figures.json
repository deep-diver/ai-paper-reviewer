(a) When an occlusion occurs, SAM 2 may lose track or follow the wrong object, leading to accumulated errors. In contrast, SAM2Long utilizes memory tree search to recover when the object reappears. (b) The per-frame J&F scores of the predicted masks are plotted at specific timestamps on the LVOS and SA-V datasets. SAM2Long demonstrates greater resilience to elapsed time compared to SAM 2, maintaining superior performance over longer periods.", "description": "Figure 1 shows a comparison of occlusion handling and long-term performance between SAM2 and SAM2Long, demonstrating SAM2Long's improved resilience to errors and occlusions.", "section": "1 INTRODUCTION"}, {"figure_path": "2410.16268/figures/figures_5_0.png", "caption": "Figure 2: (a) The pipeline of constrained memory tree: At each time step t, we maintain multiple memory pathways, each containing a memory bank and a cumulative score Sp[t]. The input frame is processed through the mask decoder conditioned on the memory bank, generating three mask candidates for each pathway. The candidates with the highest updated cumulative scores Sp,k[t] are carried forward to the next time step. (b) Mask selection with uncertainty handling: When the maximum absolute occlusion score exceeds the threshold  conf (Certain), the high-scoring mask is selected. Otherwise (Uncertain), distinct mask candidates are picked to avoid incorrect convergence.", "description": "Figure 2 illustrates the constrained tree memory structure and its uncertainty handling mechanism in SAM2Long, showing how multiple memory pathways are maintained and how mask candidates are selected at each time step based on cumulative scores and occlusion uncertainty.", "section": "3 METHOD"}, {"figure_path": "2410.16268/figures/figures_11_0.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Qualitative comparison between SAM 2 and SAM2Long, with GT (Ground Truth) provided for reference.
