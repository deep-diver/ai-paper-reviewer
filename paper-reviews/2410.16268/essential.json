SAM 2 uses a 'memory module' to remember previous frames and improve predictions, but its greedy approach struggles with long videos, complex scenes, and objects that reappear after being hidden. SAM2Long solves this by using a 'memory tree' \u2013 it keeps track of several possible segmentation paths simultaneously, selecting the best path at the end.  This makes SAM2Long far more resilient to errors that accumulate over long videos. Importantly, SAM2Long doesn't require any extra training data or parameters \u2013 it's a purely algorithmic improvement.  Experiments on several benchmark datasets consistently show SAM2Long's improvements over SAM 2, especially in handling long, complex sequences."}
