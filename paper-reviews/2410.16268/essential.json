The existing Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) sometimes struggles with long videos because errors in early frames can affect later ones. SAM2Long solves this using a 'memory tree'.  Instead of choosing just one best segmentation result from each frame, it creates multiple possible segmentations and tracks the best ones through a tree structure.  This helps overcome the 'error accumulation' problem.  The method is 'training-free', meaning it doesn't need extra training data, and significantly outperforms SAM 2 on various standard video object segmentation tests."}
