Existing large language models often fail to accurately recognize fine-grained actions.  This paper addresses the challenges of FAR by focusing on semi-supervised learning to reduce the need for extensive labeled data.  This is particularly important because labeling fine-grained actions is time-consuming and requires expert knowledge.\nThe paper introduces SeFAR, a novel framework that incorporates several innovative designs to tackle the challenges of semi-supervised FAR.  These designs include dual-level temporal element modeling to capture visual details, a strong augmentation strategy involving moderate temporal perturbation, and an adaptive regulation method to stabilize the learning process. The experimental results demonstrate that SeFAR outperforms existing methods on multiple datasets, showcasing its effectiveness and potential for broader applications in video understanding.", "affiliation": "Unmanned System Research Institute, Northwestern Polytechnical University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Action Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "2501.01245/podcast.wav"}
