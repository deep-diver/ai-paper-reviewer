Existing methods often suffer from error accumulation, increased inference time, or limited applicability across different diffusion forms. **The redundancy between consecutive video frames is not efficiently utilized**, leading to unnecessary computational overhead.\n\nTo address these challenges, TPDiff, a novel framework that **enhances both training and inference efficiency**. TPDiff progressively increases frame rates during the diffusion process, with the final stage operating at full frame rate. A stage-wise diffusion training framework aligns noise and data to train the model. Experiments demonstrate significant reductions in computational costs and improvements in inference speed.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.09566/podcast.wav"}
