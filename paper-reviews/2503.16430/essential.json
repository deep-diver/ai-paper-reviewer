Discrete tokens offer simple modeling but lose information and tokenizer training faces instability. Conversely, continuous tokens retain visual details but need complex distribution modeling, complicating the generation. **This paper aims to resolve the dilemma.**\n\nThe paper introduces **TokenBridge**, a new method, maintaining the strong representation of continuous tokens while keeping the modeling simplicity of discrete tokens. This approach decouples discretization from tokenizer training through post-training quantization. A dimension-wise quantization independently discretizes each feature dimension, with an autoregressive prediction mechanism. TokenBridge matches continuous methods' quality while using standard categorical prediction.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16430/podcast.wav"}
