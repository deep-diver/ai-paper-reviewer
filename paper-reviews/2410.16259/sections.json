Unlike previous methods which rely on marker-based tracking and multiple cameras in controlled settings, ATS leverages casually recorded videos from a single camera over a long period (e.g., a month). This approach is advantageous because it is accessible (requiring only a smartphone), natural (capturing behaviors in the agent's everyday environment), and allows for the capture of longitudinal behavior and interactions between the agent and the observer.  However, learning from such casual data presents challenges in registration and reconstruction, requiring a novel coarse-to-fine registration method to track the agent and camera over time. This results in a persistent spacetime 4D representation of the scene, the agent's trajectory, and the observer's trajectory.  The paper highlights that such a 4D reconstruction is crucial for learning a behavior model of the agent.", "first_cons": "The approach requires a novel coarse-to-fine registration method to handle the challenges of casual video data, increasing computational complexity and potentially limiting scalability.", "first_pros": "The use of casual, longitudinal video data from a single smartphone provides a more accessible and natural way to capture a wide variety of agent behaviors compared to marker-based tracking or multi-camera studio setups.", "keypoints": ["Accessible and natural data acquisition using only a single smartphone", "Longitudinal video capture (e.g., a month) for observing diverse behaviors", "Novel coarse-to-fine registration method for persistent 4D reconstruction", "Focus on learning interactive behavior models considering agent-observer interactions"], "second_cons": "The success of the method depends on the quality and quantity of the casual video data, potentially leading to limitations in model generalizability and accuracy if the data is insufficient or lacks diversity.", "second_pros": "The resulting 4D representation facilitates the learning of interactive behavior models capable of simulating agent responses to various scenarios, including changes in the environment and observer actions.", "summary": "The paper introduces Agent-to-Sim (ATS), a framework for learning interactive 3D agent behavior models from casual, longitudinal video data.  It addresses the challenges of using non-invasive, naturalistic data by proposing a novel coarse-to-fine registration technique which generates a complete and persistent 4D representation of agent and observer motion.  This 4D representation is then leveraged for training a generative model of agent behaviors.  The core innovation lies in using readily accessible, casual, longitudinal video data to train the model, making the approach highly practical while still addressing the significant challenges of reconstructing and representing complex 3D behaviors over time."}}, {"page_end_idx": 3, "page_start_idx": 2, "section_number": 2, "section_title": "Related Works", "details": {"details": "This section reviews existing works related to 4D reconstruction from monocular videos and behavior prediction and generation.  In 4D reconstruction, the challenge lies in the under-constrained nature of monocular input, leading many prior methods to rely on category-specific 3D priors, like human body models.  These approaches restrict the degrees of freedom and make it difficult to generalize to other categories, such as animals. While some recent works use optical flow and object segmentation to avoid category-specific priors and reconstruct agents from diverse categories, they mostly work with just hundreds of frames.  Regarding behavior prediction and generation, methods have evolved from physics-based models to sophisticated planning-based models and generative models that learn multi-modality from large-scale datasets.  However, many approaches rely on manually annotated data, limiting their scalability and detail.  Generative models of 3D agent motion generation often utilize simulated data or motion capture data from multiple cameras, which can restrict the naturalness of the learned behavior compared to real-world conditions.

The canonical structure uses MLPs to implicitly represent densities, colors, and semantic features at 3D locations, while the time-varying structure uses transformations to map between canonical and camera spaces, involving 3D Gaussians representing \"bones\" for deformable agent modeling and blend-skinning for transformation.\n\n-  Differentiable volume rendering is employed to render images from this 4D representation, enabling optimization of the model by minimizing differences between rendered pixels and observations using feature-metric loss.\n\n- A coarse-to-fine multi-video registration approach uses neural localizers, adapting large image models to register camera poses to canonical spaces for consistent 4D reconstruction across videos, improving robustness to scene appearance changes.\n\n-  The behavior model is hierarchical, generating goals, paths, and body poses sequentially.  The goal distribution uses an MLP trained with denoising objectives, the path distribution employs a Control UNet conditioned on goals, and the body pose distribution also uses a Control UNet conditioned on the path, integrating egocentric information (scene, observer, and past agent state) into the generation process.\n\n-  This approach enables interactive behavior generation, allowing the agent's actions to respond to both the observer and the 3D scene.", "first_cons": "The reliance on a hierarchical model for behavior generation may limit expressiveness, particularly when interactions are complex or require simultaneous consideration of multiple factors.", "first_pros": "The use of a 4D representation effectively captures the dynamic interactions between agent, scene, and observer over time, leading to more realistic behavior models.", "keypoints": ["4D representation integrates agent, scene, observer over time", "Coarse-to-fine multi-video registration handles variations across videos", "Hierarchical behavior model generates goals, paths, body poses", "Egocentric perception incorporates scene context into behavior", "Differentiable volume rendering for optimization"], "second_cons": "The computational cost of training and rendering is considerable, especially for large datasets, requiring significant computational resources.", "second_pros": "The framework enables real-to-sim transfer, facilitating realistic simulation of agent behavior in interactive environments.", "summary": "This approach uses a novel 4D representation to capture dynamic interactions and learns a hierarchical model of interactive behavior by generating goals, paths, and body poses conditioned on egocentric scene perception.
