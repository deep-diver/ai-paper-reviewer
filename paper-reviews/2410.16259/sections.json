The current methods of capturing this data are deemed impractical due to their reliance on marker-based tracking and multi-view camera setups.  The authors propose a new framework called Agent-to-Sim (ATS) which aims to learn these models from casual longitudinal videos (e.g., a month's worth of recordings from a single smartphone).  This casual approach is presented as more accessible, natural, and more representative of real-world behavior, capturing a wider spectrum of actions over a longer time period and including interactions between the agent and the observer (the person filming). However, it also introduces new challenges: the need for a consistent registration and reconstruction of videos captured over extended periods to create a persistent 4D representation (3D space + time). The paper highlights that prior works reconstruct each video independently, which fails to address the cross-video correspondence needed for a complete behavioral understanding.  The introduction sets the stage by illustrating the task with an example image of a cat and posing questions about the cat's potential future actions and movements, highlighting the complexity of predicting agent behavior from visual data. The introduction ends by stating the framework's advantages and challenges, emphasizing the shift from controlled, marker-based data collection to casual, longitudinal data collection and the associated opportunities and hurdles in generating faithful models of agent behavior.", "first_cons": "The casual approach of using longitudinal video recordings from a single smartphone introduces challenges in data registration and reconstruction, as mentioned in the introduction.

It begins by describing the 4D representation of the agent, scene, and observer, factoring it into canonical (time-independent) and time-varying structures. The canonical structure uses neural fields to represent the agent and scene, queried at any 3D location via MLPs. The time-varying structure includes observer camera pose and agent bone transformations, allowing for mapping between canonical and time-varying spaces.  Differentiable volume rendering is used to render images from this 4D representation.  The optimization process employs a coarse-to-fine multi-video registration approach using pre-trained image models like DiNO-v2 as neural localizers for initial pose estimation, followed by joint optimization of the 4D representation and poses. This coarse-to-fine approach uses neural localization for initialization to address challenges posed by evolving scenes across long time spans.  Finally, the interactive behavior model learns to generate agent behavior conditioned on the agent's perception (scene, observer, past trajectory) and goal, predicting a sequence of body poses via a hierarchical model that decomposes the generation into goal, path, and body pose.  Egocentric encoding is used to generate plausible interactive behaviors.

The hierarchical model, while elegant, might struggle with complex scenarios involving many interactions and long-term dependencies.", "first_pros": "The 4D representation method effectively captures the dynamic interactions between the agent, scene, and observer over time, leading to more realistic and interactive behavior models.

The dataset consists of RGBD videos from 4 agents (cat, dog, bunny, human) in 3 different scenes, focusing on interactions with the environment and the observer.  Camera registration is assessed using ground truth data from annotated 2D correspondences, achieving a rotation error of 6.35\u00b0 and a translation error of 0.41m.  4D reconstruction is evaluated using synchronized videos with novel view depth accuracy, showing superior results over TotalRecon, achieving DepthAcc of 0.708 for all pixels, 0.703 for foreground, and 0.685 for background. The interactive behavior model is evaluated in terms of goal, path, orientation, and joint angle prediction.  The framework is shown to outperform several baselines and achieve minimum average displacement error (minADE) of 0.448m for goal prediction, 0.234m for path prediction, 0.550 radians for orientation prediction, and 0.237 radians for joint angle prediction. Ablation studies show the importance of each component in the ATS framework, such as neural localization, featuremetric bundle adjustment, and scene annealing, for improving reconstruction accuracy and behavior generation quality.  Furthermore, the experiments demonstrate the generalizability of the learned behavior model to novel situations and its ability to generate diverse motion conditioned on various factors such as goals and observer trajectories.
