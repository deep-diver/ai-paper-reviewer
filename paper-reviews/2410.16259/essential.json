Instead of relying on precise, controlled settings and marker-based tracking like previous methods, ATS uses readily available videos captured in everyday environments.  The key is a novel technique that reconstructs the videos into a persistent 4D representation (3D space + time), precisely tracking the agent, the scene, and the camera's movement.  This 4D data is then used to train a generative model that can predict the agent's future actions based on its past behavior and current surroundings (what it 'sees').  This model allows researchers to create interactive simulations where the agent behaves realistically and responds to changes in its environment, opening many possibilities for applications like VR/AR, robot planning, and behavior research."}
