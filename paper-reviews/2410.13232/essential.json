This paper introduces World-Model-Augmented (WMA) web agents.  WMA agents use a world model (an LLM trained to predict the effects of actions) to simulate possible outcomes before making a decision. To overcome challenges in training LLMs as world models (like repetitive elements in webpages), they use a transition-focused observation abstraction \u2013 the LLM only predicts the important changes between observations. Experiments on WebArena and Mind2Web show that WMA agents improve policy selection and are significantly more cost and time-efficient than recent tree-search-based agents.  This demonstrates the potential of incorporating world models to improve LLM-based agent performance in complex environments."}
