This paper introduces World-Model-Augmented (WMA) web agents.  WMA agents use a world model to predict the outcome of actions before taking them.  To address challenges in training LLMs as world models (e.g., repetitive webpage elements, long HTML inputs), the researchers propose a transition-focused observation abstraction:  the model learns to predict concise natural language descriptions highlighting key state changes. Experiments using WebArena and Mind2Web benchmarks demonstrate that WMA agents significantly outperform existing methods in terms of task success rate, cost, and time efficiency.  The improved performance is achieved without additional policy model training, showcasing the power of the world model approach."}
