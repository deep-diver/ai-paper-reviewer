However, current LLM-based agents perform poorly on long-horizon tasks, exemplified by a success rate of only 14.41% for GPT-4 on the WebArena benchmark, compared to a 78.24% success rate for humans. This significant performance gap highlights a crucial limitation: the absence of a \"world model.\"  Humans avoid mistakes by considering potential consequences, something LLMs currently lack.  They rely heavily on trial-and-error, leading to irreversible errors (like repeatedly buying a non-refundable flight ticket). The introduction emphasizes the importance of incorporating world models into LLMs to improve their decision-making in complex, long-horizon web navigation tasks.  This involves simulating the outcomes of actions to better predict and avoid negative consequences.", "first_cons": "The introduction primarily points out the limitations of existing LLMs in web navigation without offering concrete solutions or a detailed roadmap for improvement within the introduction itself.

These agents use world models to simulate the outcomes of actions before actually performing them, leading to better decision-making in web navigation tasks. The section details the formulation of WMA web agents as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), highlighting the challenges of using LLMs as world models due to issues like repetitive webpage elements and long HTML sequences. To address this, the authors propose a transition-focused observation abstraction, where the LLM world model predicts free-form natural language descriptions emphasizing only the significant changes between webpage states. The training process involves harvesting agent trajectories, applying the transition-focused abstraction to create training data, and finally, training the LLM world model to predict these abstracted observations.
