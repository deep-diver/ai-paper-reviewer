Existing methods often fall short, struggling to preserve identity or facing limitations in handling multiple identities/subjects. They increase complexity in model training/inference.\n\nThis paper introduces **Concat-ID**, a framework that utilizes Variational Autoencoders to extract image features, concatenated with video latents, leveraging 3D self-attention mechanisms. It balances identity consistency/facial editability through a novel cross-video pairing strategy and multi-stage training. Concat-ID demonstrates its effectiveness in single/multi-identity generation, and seamlessly scales to multi-subject scenarios like virtual try-on.", "affiliation": "Gaoling School of AI, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.14151/podcast.wav"}
