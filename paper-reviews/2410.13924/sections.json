Three main experimental approaches were used to assess the dataset's impact:\n\n1. **Pre-training:** The models were pre-trained on the ARKitScenes LabelMaker dataset (ALS200, with 186 classes, and ALC, with a wordnet label space) and then fine-tuned on the standard ScanNet and ScanNet200 benchmarks.  This showed that pre-training on the large-scale, real-world ALS200 dataset significantly improved mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores compared to training from scratch or other pre-training methods like self-supervised learning (PonderV2) and data augmentation (Mix3D).  Specifically, pre-training on ALS200 improved MinkowskiNet's performance on ScanNet to 77.0 mIoU (compared to 73.6 for vanilla training), and Point Transformer's to 81.2 mIoU (compared to 77.5 for vanilla training).  This suggests that the automatically generated labels, despite imperfections, are valuable for learning robust features.\n\n2. **Co-training with ALS200:** The ALS200 dataset was combined with ScanNet200 and used to train MinkowskiNet from scratch. This approach yielded a noticeable improvement in performance compared to training solely on ScanNet200, further highlighting the dataset's value.\n\n3. **Joint-training:** Point Transformer V3 (PTv3) with Point Prompt Training (PPT) was employed for joint training on multiple datasets, including ALS200.  The results demonstrated that incorporating ALS200 significantly improved the mIoU scores on ScanNet and ScanNet200, often achieving state-of-the-art results.\n\nThe study also included evaluations on ScanNet++, S3DIS, and Structured3D datasets.  While the benefits of pre-training on ALS200 were generally observed, the results varied across datasets, suggesting that the dataset's impact might depend on the characteristics of the specific benchmark dataset.
