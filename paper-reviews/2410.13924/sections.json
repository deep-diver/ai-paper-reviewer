Method: Enhancing LabelMaker for Scale\n\nThis section details improvements to the LabelMaker pipeline, aiming to create a robust and scalable system for generating dense semantic annotations for large-scale datasets like ARKitScenes.  The core improvements focus on making LabelMaker suitable for processing the vast amount of data in ARKitScenes, which contains 5047 captures across 1661 unique scenes. This involves two key aspects: enhancing the pipeline's ability to handle the sheer volume of data and improving the accuracy and robustness of the annotations generated.\n\n### 3.2 Improving LabelMaker to make it scale to ARKitScenes [4]\nThe improvements made to LabelMaker (now LabelMakerV2) address the challenges of scaling to the size of the ARKitScenes dataset.\n\n*   **Integrating Grounded-SAM:**  This significantly improves the robustness of the system by incorporating the strengths of state-of-the-art models like Grounded-SAM, enabling precise segmentation even in challenging scenarios. \n*   **Aligning to Gravity:** This crucial step ensures consistent performance across the entire dataset by addressing inconsistencies in data orientation (e.g., phone rotation during capture), improving the accuracy of gravity-based segmentation. The process involves projecting sky direction (from the IMU data) onto each 2D frame, computing the angle between sky direction and upward direction, and rotating the image to align the sky direction upwards. Then the rotation is reversed to get the correct segmentation output.  \n*   **Optimizing compute resource scheduling:** To efficiently manage the immense computational requirements, they implemented a system that distributes the pipeline\u2019s steps as individual jobs to a GPU cluster using SLURM as a dependency manager. The efficiency is increased by carefully estimating the time required for each job to minimize the waiting time and improve overall execution speed.\n\n### 3.3 Scaling beyond existing datasets\nBeyond ARKitScenes, the improved LabelMakerV2 is designed to work with data from other ubiquitous mobile scanning platforms such as Scanner 3D for iOS.
