While language and image models have benefited from vast amounts of readily available data (enabling self-supervised training and remarkable performance gains), 3D scene understanding struggles due to a lack of large-scale, adequately labeled datasets.  Existing methods heavily rely on direct supervision, which is expensive and labor-intensive to obtain at scale. The authors posit that the \"GPT moment\" of 3D scene understanding is hindered by this data limitation and introduce ARKit LabelMaker as a solution, aiming to create a large-scale, real-world dataset with dense semantic annotations to address this challenge.  The introduction specifically raises questions about the advantages of real-world data over synthetic counterparts, the feasibility of reducing labeling efforts, and the potential benefits current 3D models could reap from a significantly larger dataset.  They will subsequently use ARKitScenes dataset as a foundation, and then extend the LabelMaker pipeline to solve the challenge, and they propose to automatically generate dense semantic labels for the dataset.", "first_cons": "The introduction's discussion of the \"GPT moment\" in the context of 3D vision is somewhat vague.

In contrast, 3D scene understanding lags significantly due to the absence of comparably large, high-quality labeled datasets.  This necessitates the development of new techniques for data acquisition and annotation. The paper introduces ARKit LabelMaker, a large-scale, real-world 3D dataset with dense semantic annotations generated via an automated pipeline, designed to close this data gap and advance the field of 3D scene understanding. The authors pose key questions regarding the benefits of real-world data compared to synthetic data and whether current models can significantly benefit from a significantly larger real-world dataset."}}, {"page_end_idx": 2, "page_start_idx": 2, "section_number": 2, "section_title": "Related Works", "details": {"details": "This section, \"Related Works,\" provides a comprehensive overview of existing datasets and models for 3D semantic segmentation.

The Grounded-SAM integration leverages the strengths of both SAM (Segment Anything Model) and Grounding DINO for more robust and accurate segmentation, while the resource optimization ensures efficient use of compute resources, even on datasets with varying scene sizes (spanning from 65 to 13796 frames). The pipeline is designed for distributed processing and incorporates a recovery strategy to handle job failures gracefully.  The pipeline's efficiency is highlighted by its ability to process the entire ARKitScenes dataset, utilizing 48000 GPU hours.
