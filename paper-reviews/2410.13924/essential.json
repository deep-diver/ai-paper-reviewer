Unlike previous datasets, ARKit LabelMaker boasts dense semantic annotations automatically generated using an improved pipeline (LabelMakerV2). This significantly reduces the time and cost associated with manual labeling. The researchers enhanced their automatic annotation pipeline with state-of-the-art models and robust processing techniques to handle large-scale data.  Experiments on popular benchmarks (ScanNet, ScanNet200) using MinkowskiNet and Point Transformer models show that using ARKit LabelMaker for pre-training drastically improves performance compared to other pre-training methods, even surpassing results achieved with much larger synthetic datasets.  The dataset also benefits models trained on multiple datasets. In essence, the study highlights the effectiveness of large-scale, real-world data for 3D scene understanding and provides a valuable resource for the research community.  The pipeline was also extended to work with commonly available mobile scanning apps, facilitating even broader data collection and increased accessibility."}
