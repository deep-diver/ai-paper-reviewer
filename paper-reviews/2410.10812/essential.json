Unlike previous methods relying solely on discrete or continuous representations, HART uses a hybrid approach, combining discrete tokens (for the big picture) and continuous residual tokens (for fine details). This hybrid tokenizer, combined with a lightweight residual diffusion module, enables the generation of high-quality 1024x1024 images. The model's efficiency is significantly higher than state-of-the-art diffusion models, achieving 4.5-7.7x higher throughput and 3.1-5.9x lower latency on A100 GPUs while maintaining competitive image quality in terms of FID and CLIP scores.  The researchers also employed several training strategies to enhance efficiency and quality, such as alternating training and token subsampling.  The code has been open-sourced, making the model accessible for broader use and research.  The results show that HART significantly outperforms existing autoregressive models and can rival diffusion models in image quality while providing substantial efficiency gains."}
