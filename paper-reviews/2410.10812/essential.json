Unlike existing models relying solely on discrete or continuous latent spaces, HART uniquely employs a hybrid approach combining both.  This hybrid tokenizer decomposes the continuous latents from an autoencoder into discrete tokens representing the image's overall structure, and continuous residual tokens capturing fine details. The discrete tokens are processed by a scalable-resolution discrete AR model, while a lightweight residual diffusion module handles the continuous component.  This hybrid design overcomes limitations of previous AR models which struggled with high-resolution image generation and reconstruction quality.  Experimental results demonstrate that HART generates 1024x1024 images with quality comparable to state-of-the-art diffusion models, but significantly faster; it achieves 4.5-7.7x higher throughput and 3.1-5.9x lower latency, using considerably fewer computations. HART also excels in class-conditioned image generation, outperforming previous AR models."}
