These AR models convert images into discrete visual tokens, which are then processed similarly to language tokens.  While diffusion models have achieved higher generation quality, they are computationally expensive.  Autoregressive models offer the advantage of being computationally less intensive, especially when they can predict multiple tokens in parallel. However, AR models currently lag behind in reconstruction quality due to limitations of discrete tokenizers and the prohibitive cost of training high-resolution models.  The paper focuses on bridging this gap by developing a model that matches diffusion models' visual generation quality while maintaining significant speed advantages.  Specifically, it points out that existing AR models exhibit significantly poorer reconstruction capabilities and struggle to generate high-resolution images compared to diffusion models.", "first_cons": "Current autoregressive models for visual generation have significantly poorer reconstruction capabilities compared to diffusion models.", "first_pros": "Autoregressive models offer significantly improved efficiency over diffusion models in terms of computational cost.", "keypoints": ["Autoregressive models are computationally less expensive than diffusion models, with one example showing an 8.5x reduction in computational intensity.", "Existing AR models struggle with high-resolution image generation and poor reconstruction quality due to discrete tokenizers.", "The paper aims to create an autoregressive model that rivals diffusion models in quality while being significantly faster and more efficient in terms of computation and cost."], "second_cons": "Existing AR models struggle to directly and efficiently generate high-resolution (e.g., 1024x1024) images.", "second_pros": "The paper introduces a new approach to address the limitations of existing autoregressive models, potentially leading to a model that significantly outperforms existing ones in both quality and efficiency.", "summary": "This section introduces the concept of autoregressive (AR) models for visual generation and highlights their computational advantages over diffusion models.

VAEs and GANs are presented as earlier methods, while diffusion models are highlighted as the current state-of-the-art, capable of generating high-quality images. However, diffusion models are computationally expensive, with models like DiT-XL/2 requiring 86.2T MACs for 1024x1024 image generation. The review then shifts to Autoregressive models, noting their limitations in reconstruction quality due to discrete tokenizers and high training costs for high-resolution images.  Several advancements in autoregressive models are mentioned, including improvements in autoencoders, sampling speed, and tokenization efficiency, along with the exploration of residual quantization to reduce tokenization error.
