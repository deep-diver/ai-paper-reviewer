These AR models convert images into discrete visual tokens, then process them similarly to language tokens. While diffusion models currently achieve superior visual generation quality, they are computationally expensive.  Even with efficient samplers, models like DiT-XL/2 require 86.2T MACs at 1024x1024 resolution to generate an image, compared to 10.1T MACs for a similarly sized AR model (8.5x less computationally intensive).  This section introduces the challenge of developing an AR model that matches the quality of diffusion models while maintaining speed and efficiency. Current AR models suffer from two main drawbacks:  1) poor reconstruction quality of discrete tokenizers, limiting the generation's upper bound, and 2) the inefficiency of directly generating high-resolution images (e.g., 1024x1024).", "first_cons": "Current autoregressive (AR) visual generation models lag behind diffusion models in image reconstruction quality due to the limitations of discrete tokenizers.", "first_pros": "Autoregressive models offer significant computational advantages over diffusion models, potentially achieving 8.5x less computational intensity for comparable image generation.", "keypoints": ["Autoregressive models are gaining popularity for visual generation due to their versatility and generality.", "Diffusion models currently provide higher quality images but are computationally expensive (86.2T MACs for DiT-XL/2 vs 10.1T MACs for similar AR models).", "Current AR models struggle with 1) poor reconstruction quality from discrete tokens and 2) inefficient high-resolution (1024x1024) image generation"], "second_cons": "Existing AR models are limited in their ability to generate high-resolution images (e.g., 1024x1024) efficiently.", "second_pros": "The computational efficiency of AR models makes them attractive for visual generation applications, particularly when compared to the higher cost of diffusion models.", "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) models offer a promising approach to visual generation, potentially surpassing diffusion models in efficiency.

Unlike previous models that rely solely on discrete or continuous latent spaces, HART uniquely integrates both, employing a hybrid tokenizer and residual diffusion. The hybrid tokenizer decomposes continuous latents from an autoencoder into two components: discrete tokens capturing the \"big picture\" and continuous tokens representing residual details. These are then processed by a hybrid transformer: a scalable-resolution discrete AR model for the discrete components and a lightweight residual diffusion module for the continuous components.  This hybrid approach significantly improves reconstruction quality, as evidenced by a reduction in Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID) from 2.11 to 0.30 on the MJHQ-30K dataset, leading to a 31% improvement in generation FID.

Traditional autoregressive models rely on discrete tokenizers, which, while computationally efficient, struggle to capture fine-grained details in images, leading to a lower bound in reconstruction quality. Diffusion models, on the other hand, use continuous tokenizers, resulting in better image reconstruction, but at significantly higher computational costs. HART's hybrid tokenizer addresses this limitation by decomposing the continuous latents from an autoencoder into two components: discrete tokens that capture the 'big picture', and residual tokens that represent the finer details not easily captured by discrete tokens.  The discrete tokens are modeled by a scalable-resolution discrete autoregressive model, while the residual tokens are learned using a lightweight residual diffusion module.  A key innovation is the alternating training scheme where the visual decoder is trained with equal probability using both discrete and continuous visual tokens, which improves the overall reconstruction quality.  This approach allows the model to capture high-frequency detail while maintaining computational efficiency, as only the continuous residual tokens need to be processed at inference time.", "first_cons": "The alternating training process, while effective, might increase the complexity and time required for model training compared to using only discrete or continuous tokenizers.", "first_pros": "The hybrid tokenizer significantly improves reconstruction quality by achieving comparable continuous rFID to the SDXL tokenizer (a state-of-the-art model), while maintaining the discrete rFID of the original VQ tokenizer.
