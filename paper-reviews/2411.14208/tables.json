The first four rows present the comparison results, while the last two rows show the ablation studies.\nViewExtrapolator w/o GA denotes results without guidance annealing, and ViewExtrapolator w/o RA denotes results without resampling annealing.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of the proposed ViewExtrapolator method against two baseline methods (3DGS and DRGS) for novel view extrapolation.  The comparison uses three metrics: Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS).  Higher SSIM and PSNR values indicate better image quality, while a lower LPIPS value signifies improved perceptual similarity to the ground truth. The table also includes ablation studies, showing the impact of removing guidance annealing and resampling annealing from the ViewExtrapolator method.  This demonstrates the individual contributions of each component to the overall performance.", "section": "4. Experiments"}]
