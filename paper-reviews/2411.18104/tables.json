It details the number of unique templates used to generate the problems, the total count of problems in the dataset, and the ranges and averages of the lengths (measured in tokens) of both the problem statements and their corresponding solutions (in code and natural language formats). The tokenizer used is specified as 'o-200k'. This information is crucial for understanding the dataset's scale and characteristics, particularly for researchers working with large language models (LLMs) in the context of mathematical problem-solving.", "section": "3 TemplateMath Part I: TemplateGSM Dataset"}]
