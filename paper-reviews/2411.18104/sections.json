[{"heading_title": "LLM Math Struggle", "details": {"summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities in natural language processing, yet they struggle significantly with mathematical reasoning tasks.  This \"LLM Math Struggle\" stems from several key factors. **Data scarcity** is a major hurdle; existing mathematical datasets are limited in both size and diversity, hindering the ability of LLMs to generalize effectively across various problem types and complexity levels.  The **inherent symbolic and structured nature of mathematics** poses a challenge to the LLMs' predominantly statistical approach to language processing.  Mathematical reasoning requires precise logic and step-by-step execution, whereas LLMs often rely on probabilistic pattern recognition, making them prone to errors in complex calculations or logical deductions.  Furthermore, **the lack of effective supervisory signals** during training exacerbates these issues.  While numerical solutions are available, the underlying rationale and logical steps often remain implicit. Developing more comprehensive and high-quality mathematical datasets, incorporating more rigorous training methods that emphasize symbolic reasoning and structured problem-solving, and designing more effective evaluation metrics tailored to mathematical abilities are crucial steps towards addressing this \"LLM Math Struggle\" and unleashing the full potential of LLMs in mathematical domains."}}, {"heading_title": "Template-Based TDG", "details": {"summary": "Template-based Data Generation (TDG) offers a novel approach to creating large-scale, high-quality datasets for training language models in mathematical reasoning.  **Its core innovation lies in leveraging LLMs (like GPT-4) to automatically generate parameterized meta-templates.** These templates act as blueprints, enabling the systematic production of diverse mathematical problems and their corresponding solutions.
