Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, hindering the development of sophisticated mathematical reasoning abilities in AI systems. This creates a significant obstacle for advancing AI's capacity for problem-solving in mathematical domains.\nThis paper introduces Template-based Data Generation (TDG), a novel method that uses LLMs (specifically GPT-4) to automatically generate meta-templates for creating a vast array of high-quality mathematical problems and their solutions.  The researchers used TDG to generate the TemplateGSM dataset comprising over 7 million problems, which are publicly available.  **This addresses the data scarcity problem and significantly improves the ability to train and evaluate LLMs for mathematical reasoning.**  The method also incorporates a verification process to ensure data accuracy.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.18104/podcast.wav"}
