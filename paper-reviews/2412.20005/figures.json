The overview of the OneKE system, supporting various domains (science, news, etc.) and data (Web HTML, PDF, etc.).", "description": "OneKE is a dockerized schema-guided LLM agent-based knowledge extraction system.  The figure illustrates its modular design, showcasing three core components: the Schema Agent (processes input data and schemas, handling various data types and formats like HTML and PDF), the Extraction Agent (extracts knowledge using LLMs, adapting to diverse tasks and LLMs), and the Reflection Agent (refines and corrects errors using a case repository).  The system supports diverse domains (science, news, etc.) and utilizes a configurable knowledge base for schema management, debugging, and improvement. The diagram visually represents the flow of information through the system, highlighting the interaction between the agents and the knowledge base.", "section": "Design and Implementation"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.20005/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 2. Performance of different components in OneKE.", "description": "Figure 2 shows the performance comparison of different components within the OneKE system on two benchmark datasets: CrossNER (a cross-domain Named Entity Recognition dataset) and NYT-11-HRL (a Relation Extraction dataset within the news domain).  The results illustrate the effectiveness of incorporating case retrieval and case reflection mechanisms into the OneKE's extraction agent.  The bar chart displays F1 scores for different model variations (Vanilla, Case Retrieval, Case Reflection) using two different LLMs: LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and GPT-4-turbo.  It demonstrates improvements in performance achieved through these techniques on both NER and RE tasks.", "section": "3 Evaluation"}]
