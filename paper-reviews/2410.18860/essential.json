DeCoRe masks retrieval heads in LLMs and contrasts their output with a base LLM, improving contextual faithfulness and factual accuracy.", "summary": "DeCoRe: A novel, training-free decoding method significantly reduces LLM hallucinations by contrasting outputs from masked and unmasked retrieval heads, boosting accuracy on various tasks.", "takeaways": ["DeCoRe, a training-free decoding method, significantly reduces LLM hallucinations.", "Masking retrieval heads in LLMs induces hallucinations, which DeCoRe mitigates by contrasting outputs.", "DeCoRe improves accuracy on summarization, instruction-following, and question-answering tasks."], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) sometimes produce inaccurate or fabricated information, known as hallucinations. This paper introduces DeCoRe, a new technique to reduce these hallucinations. DeCoRe works by identifying and temporarily disabling specific parts of the LLM (called 'retrieval heads') that are responsible for retrieving information from context.  It then compares the output of the modified LLM to the original LLM's output, using a method called 'contrastive decoding.' This highlights the differences and helps the model generate more accurate and truthful responses. Experiments show that DeCoRe significantly improves accuracy on tasks like summarization and question answering, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and improving LLM reliability."}
