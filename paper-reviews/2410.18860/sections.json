The prevalence of hallucinations in LLMs is a major concern, particularly in domains like clinical decision-making and legal reasoning where factual accuracy is paramount.

Masking retrieval heads, identified as attention heads responsible for retrieving information from the context, is hypothesized to induce hallucinations. DeCoRe contrasts the outputs of the base LLM and the masked LLM (LLM with masked retrieval heads), using conditional entropy as a guide to dynamically adjust the contrast. The contrastive decoding amplifies the differences between the two outputs, favoring the base LLM's predictions when the conditional entropy is high.  This dynamic approach aims to boost the faithfulness of the generated responses by enhancing accurate predictions and penalizing hallucinated ones. The method of masking retrieval heads involves identifying these heads using a retrieval score based on copy-paste operations on the Needle-in-a-Haystack dataset, selecting the top N retrieval heads to be masked, and applying a mask to those heads during the multi-head attention mechanism. The process is training-free, which is a key advantage of DeCoRe.", "first_cons": "The method relies on identifying and masking 'retrieval heads', and the accuracy of this identification and its effect on hallucination might vary across different LLMs and tasks.
