However, a significant challenge hindering their reliability and wider adoption, especially in high-stakes domains, is their propensity for hallucinations.  Hallucinations are defined as instances where the model generates content that is not grounded in reality or misrepresents facts.  This unreliability undermines the trustworthiness of LLMs, particularly in applications like clinical decision-making and legal reasoning.  Understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' hallucinations is crucial for mitigating this issue.  Recent research has identified specific attention heads within the Transformer architecture, termed \"retrieval heads,\" which are responsible for extracting relevant information from the provided context.  These retrieval heads play a key role in ensuring factual accuracy and contextual faithfulness.  The research in this paper focuses on exploring the potential of these retrieval heads in addressing the problem of hallucinations.

Masking these heads induces hallucinations, and DeCoRe leverages contrastive decoding to penalize outputs resembling those from the hallucinating model, amplifying the accurate predictions of the base model.  The method dynamically adjusts the contrastive effect based on the conditional entropy of the model's next token distribution:  higher entropy increases the contrast, penalizing predictions aligning with the hallucinated output.  This process is implemented by masking retrieval heads using a mask which sets the value to 0 if the head is a retrieval head and 1 otherwise. The masked multi-head attention output is then calculated using a scalar multiplication between the mask and the original output. The next token distribution is calculated by contrasting the next token distributions of the base and masked models using a scaling factor (\u03b1) which is dynamically adjusted using the conditional entropy. Finally, the next token is selected based on the weighted contrastive decoding of both models. The experimental setup involves masking retrieval heads using the method proposed by Wu et al. (2024), which involves analyzing attention patterns on the Needle-in-a-Haystack dataset.

The authors categorize hallucinations into two types: factuality and faithfulness. Factuality hallucinations involve factually incorrect generated content, while faithfulness hallucinations refer to instances where the generated content doesn't accurately reflect the provided source information.  The authors highlight the \"snowballing\" effect of hallucinations in longer generation tasks due to the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding.  The evaluation uses diverse benchmarks to assess contextual faithfulness, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities, focusing on tasks requiring high contextual faithfulness.  Datasets used include XSum, MemoTrap, and NQ-Open for evaluating faithfulness; TruthfulQA, TriviaQA, and NQ-Open for evaluating factuality; and MuSiQue for multi-hop reasoning tasks.  Metrics employed vary by task but include ROUGE-L, BERTScore, factKB, accuracy, and Exact Match (EM).
