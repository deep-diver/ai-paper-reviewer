The core idea is to identify and mask specific \"retrieval heads\" within the LLM's Transformer architecture, these heads being responsible for retrieving information from the context. Masking these heads is hypothesized to induce hallucinations.  DeCoRe then contrasts the next-token distributions of both the base and masked LLMs using a contrastive decoding mechanism, where the contribution of each model's prediction is weighted based on the conditional entropy of the base model's next-token distribution. Higher entropy (indicating uncertainty) leads to stronger penalization of the masked model's output, thereby promoting more faithful responses. The method is training-free, making it readily applicable to existing LLMs.", "first_cons": "The effectiveness of DeCoRe might vary depending on the specific task and LLM used, necessitating potential adjustments or further fine-tuning for optimal performance across different scenarios.", "first_pros": "DeCoRe is a training-free method, making it readily adaptable to various existing LLMs without requiring additional training or modification of the model architecture.", "keypoints": ["DeCoRe is a training-free method for mitigating hallucinations in LLMs.", "It leverages the contrasting outputs of a base LLM and a masked LLM (with retrieval heads masked).", "The masking of retrieval heads is hypothesized to induce hallucinations.", "Contrastive decoding dynamically adjusts the weighting of base and masked LLM outputs based on the conditional entropy of the base model (higher entropy = stronger penalization of masked model output).", "Experiments show significant improvements on tasks requiring high contextual faithfulness: summarization (XSum by 18.6%), instruction following (MemoTrap by 10.9%), and open-book question answering (NQ-Open by 2.4% and NQ-Swap by 5.5%)."], "second_cons": "The reliance on identifying retrieval heads might be challenging for certain LLM architectures or require significant computational resources for analysis, potentially limiting scalability.", "second_pros": "The dynamic entropy-based weighting mechanism enables adaptive contrast and enhances the accuracy of the model's predictions, especially in long-form generation tasks.", "summary": "DeCoRe is a training-free decoding strategy that mitigates LLM hallucinations by masking retrieval heads (hypothesized to cause hallucinations) and contrasting the outputs of a base and masked LLM.

It begins by categorizing hallucinations into two types: factuality and faithfulness. Factuality hallucinations involve incorrect information compared to world knowledge, while faithfulness hallucinations concern the model's failure to accurately represent the provided context. The authors highlight the \"snowball\" effect in long-generation tasks, where initial errors compound, leading to more inaccuracies. The experiment aims to assess contextual faithfulness, factual accuracy, and multi-hop reasoning capabilities. Three key questions are posed: Can DeCoRe improve contextual faithfulness?  Can DeCoRe maintain or improve factual recall? Does DeCoRe enhance multi-hop reasoning, particularly when combined with Chain-of-Thought prompting?  Three types of datasets are used for evaluation: faithfulness (XSum, MemoTrap, Instruction-Following Eval, NQ-Open, NQ-Swap), factuality (TruthfulQA, TriviaQA, PopQA, NQ-Open), and chain-of-thought reasoning (MuSiQue).
