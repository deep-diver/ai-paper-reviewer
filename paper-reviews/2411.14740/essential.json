Many rely on pre-trained 2D models or complex test-time optimization, resulting in slow processing, limited scalability, and inconsistencies in texture quality.  Additionally, generating high-resolution details remains a challenge.  These methods struggle with generating high-quality results efficiently and struggle with 3D consistency and high-resolution details. \nThe researchers address these issues by proposing TEXGen, a large generative diffusion model designed to work directly in the UV texture space.  This feed-forward approach avoids time-consuming optimization and offers superior speed and scalability.  The model incorporates a novel hybrid 2D-3D network architecture, efficiently handling high-resolution details while maintaining global 3D consistency. TEXGen significantly outperforms existing techniques, producing high-quality textures quickly and efficiently.  It also supports additional applications, such as texture inpainting and completion from sparse views, further showcasing its versatility and potential for broad impact.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.14740/podcast.wav"}
