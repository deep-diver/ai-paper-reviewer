Current VLM training, however, predominantly relies on datasets with short answers and minimal rationales. This limitation hinders the models' ability to generalize to tasks demanding more comprehensive reasoning. The authors highlight that training solely on short answers does not effectively translate to strong CoT reasoning capabilities.  They cite an example where, after training on 26k direct predictions from the ChartQA dataset, the accuracy of direct predictions increased by 2.9 points (from 70.2% to 73.1%), while CoT prediction accuracy only improved by a meager 0.6 points (from 71.2% to 71.8%). This disparity underscores the ineffectiveness of current training methods in fostering robust CoT reasoning.  The paper sets the stage for introducing a novel approach to address this limitation by leveraging additional data and techniques to explicitly train CoT capabilities.", "first_cons": "The current training methods for VLMs are shown to be ineffective in fostering robust CoT reasoning.
