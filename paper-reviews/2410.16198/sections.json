Current VLM training heavily relies on datasets with short answers and minimal rationales, hindering the models' ability to generalize to complex reasoning tasks. The authors highlight the limitations of this approach, citing an example where training on direct predictions from a dataset of 26k examples increased direct prediction accuracy by only 2.9% (70.2% to 73.1%), while CoT prediction accuracy improved by a mere 0.6% (71.2% to 71.8%).
