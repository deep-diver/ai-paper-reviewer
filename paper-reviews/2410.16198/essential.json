Current methods often rely on limited data with short answers, hindering the models' ability to handle complex reasoning tasks.  The researchers propose a two-step solution. First, they use the powerful GPT-4 language model to generate detailed explanations (rationales) for answers, enriching the training dataset.  Second, they employ reinforcement learning to further refine the models' reasoning abilities, focusing on aligning the models' generated rationales with the correct answers.  Experiments show this approach significantly improves the VLM's performance on various reasoning tasks, highlighting the importance of detailed rationales in VLM training and demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning capabilities."}
