Current training methods often rely on limited data with short answers, hindering the development of robust reasoning abilities.  The researchers propose a two-pronged solution. First, they distill high-quality rationales from GPT-40, a powerful language model, to enrich their training data. Second, they employ reinforcement learning to further refine the model's reasoning process.  Specifically, they construct pairs of correct and incorrect reasoning chains and use a technique called Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to guide the model towards generating more accurate reasoning paths.  Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements on various benchmark datasets. The improved VLM exhibits enhanced CoT reasoning abilities and better generalization to direct answer prediction tasks. The researchers also share a large, comprehensive CoT dataset, SHAREGPT-40-REASONING, which contributes valuable resources to the community."}
