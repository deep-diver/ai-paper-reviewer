Unlike existing methods that focus on comparing model outputs, RM-BENCH assesses the reward model's ability to distinguish subtle differences and resist style biases.  They tested nearly 40 reward models, finding that even the best ones struggle with style bias, achieving an average performance far from ideal (only 46.6% accuracy with style bias).  They also compared different reward model types, discovering that Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) models showed better performance on RM-BENCH.  The strong correlation found between RM-BENCH scores and policy model performance makes it a valuable tool for selecting better reward models. This research highlights that current reward models need significant improvement, and that mitigating style bias is key."}
