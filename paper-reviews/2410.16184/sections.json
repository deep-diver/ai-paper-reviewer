In RLHF, reward models act as proxies for human values, guiding the training of LLMs to produce outputs aligned with human preferences.  In Inference Scaling Laws, they select the best response from a set of candidates. The authors point out the current lack of sophisticated benchmarks for evaluating reward models. Existing benchmarks often compare responses generated by LLMs of varying capabilities, failing to assess the models' sensitivity to subtle content changes and style variations. This shortcoming leads to a low correlation between reward model scores and actual policy model performance.

It formally defines these two key components, explaining their roles in reinforcement learning and related techniques.  The reward model acts as a proxy for human preferences, providing a numerical score (reward) to evaluate the quality of a language model's response to a given prompt. The policy model is the language model being trained and aligned; it generates the responses. The section also introduces the multi-objective reward model, which provides multiple reward signals to better capture the complexities of human preferences (e.g., correctness, readability, verbosity). Finally, it describes the evaluation process for reward models using a classification problem and accuracy as a key metric.  The explanation of Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) is also provided, contrasting it with using explicit reward models. DPO directly optimizes the policy model based on the implicit reward signal derived from its probabilities and those of a reference model, offering an alternative approach for training without a separate reward model.", "first_cons": "The explanation of DPO, while informative, might be challenging for readers without prior knowledge of reinforcement learning or advanced optimization techniques.

It focuses on four key domains: Chat, Code, Math, and Safety, covering diverse real-world scenarios.  For each domain, the benchmark generates pairs of responses (chosen and rejected) using the same powerful language model (gpt-40), ensuring subtle differences between them.  To assess sensitivity to subtle changes, rejected responses contain minor errors introduced through techniques like jailbreaking or multi-sampling.  Robustness against style biases is evaluated using style-controlled prompts, generating variants in different styles (concise, detailed, markdown-formatted). The correctness of responses is verified by human annotators.  Finally,  the dataset includes nearly 1500 samples, with varying average token counts across prompts and responses in different domains, (e.g., Chat has 129 samples with an average of 31 tokens in prompts, 351 in chosen responses, and 406 in rejected responses).
