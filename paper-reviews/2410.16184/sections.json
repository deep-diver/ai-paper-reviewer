In Inference Scaling Laws, reward models are used to select the best response from a set of candidates based on predicted rewards. Despite their importance, current benchmarks for reward models are insufficient.  They often evaluate models by having them distinguish between responses generated by models of varying power, neglecting subtle content changes and variations in style. This leads to a low correlation with actual policy model performance.

It formally defines the reward model as a function that assigns a numerical score (reward) to a generated response based on a given prompt, represented as *Ry(x, y)*, where *x* is the prompt and *y* is the response.  The model's parameters, denoted by \u03b8, are learned from a preference dataset *Dpref*, which consists of response pairs labeled as preferred (*yc*) or rejected (*yr*).  The learning objective is to maximize the difference in reward scores between the chosen and rejected responses. The section introduces the concept of a multi-objective reward model, which provides multiple reward signals (e.g., readability, correctness, verbosity) represented as *R(x, y) \u2208 RK*, where K is the number of distinct reward signals.  Finally, it describes the Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) model, a reward-model-free method that optimizes the policy model directly using implicit reward signals derived from the model's own probability distribution, rather than relying on a separate reward model.  The DPO reward function is formally defined as *R(x, y) = log(\u03c0\u03bf(y|x)/\u03c4ref(y|x)) + \u03b2log Z(x)*, where \u03c0\u03bf(y|x) and \u03c4ref(y|x) are the probabilities assigned by the policy model and the reference model, respectively, and \u03b2 and Z(x) represent a regularization constant and a partition function.", "first_cons": "The mathematical formalisms, while precise, might be challenging for readers without a strong background in machine learning or information theory.", "first_pros": "Provides clear and concise definitions of key concepts like reward models, multi-objective reward models, and DPO models, essential for understanding the rest of the paper.", "keypoints": ["Formal definition of the reward model: *Ry(x, y)*", "Learning objective: Maximizing the reward difference between chosen (*yc*) and rejected (*yr*) responses.", "Multi-objective reward model: *R(x, y) \u2208 RK*", "Direct Policy Optimization (DPO): Reward-model-free approach using implicit rewards."], "second_cons": "The explanation of DPO could be more intuitive, as the formula might be opaque to readers unfamiliar with the underlying concepts of probability distributions and optimization.", "second_pros": "Successfully introduces essential mathematical notation and concepts early on, enabling a more rigorous and precise discussion in subsequent sections.", "summary": "This preliminary section introduces the fundamental concepts of reward models and policy models in the context of language model alignment.
