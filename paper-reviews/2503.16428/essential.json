Existing block-sparse methods grapple with a trade-off between accuracy and efficiency due to the high overhead in determining block importance, rendering them impractical for real-world use. There's a need for a block-sparse attention mechanism that accelerates long-context Transformers without sacrificing accuracy. \n\nXAttention is introduced as a plug-and-play framework improving the efficiency of block-sparse attention. It identifies non-essential blocks using the sum of antidiagonal values in the attention matrix as a proxy for block importance, which allows for precise pruning, high sparsity, and accelerated inference. Evaluations show accuracy comparable to full attention, delivering computational gains with up to 13.5\u00d7 acceleration in attention computation. The approach unlocks the potential of block sparse attention for efficient LCTM deployment.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16428/podcast.wav"}
