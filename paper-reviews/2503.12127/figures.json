HySAC builds a hyperbolic embedding that manages content safety through an entailment hierarchy. Unsafe text and images are projected to dedicated regions of hyperbolic space, allowing for safety-aware retrieval and classification.", "description": "This figure illustrates the HySAC model's architecture and workflow. HySAC leverages the hierarchical nature of hyperbolic space to represent safe and unsafe content. Safe text and image embeddings are located near the origin, while unsafe ones are projected further away.  A contrastive loss function aligns safe and unsafe image-text pairs, while an entailment loss enforces hierarchical relationships within the embedding space.  The model allows for safety-aware retrieval; unsafe queries can be dynamically redirected towards safer alternatives or the original (unsafe) results can be returned.", "section": "4 HySAC: Hyperbolic Safety-Aware CLIP"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.12127/extracted/6282813/images/chart_distribution_full.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Distributions of embedding distances from the root. We embed all ViSU training samples and visualize their distance distribution from the root. While CLIP and Safe-CLIP do not separate between texts and images, MERU does.

The x-axis represents the distance from the root, and the y-axis represents the frequency of embeddings at that distance.  The ViSU dataset was used to generate these distributions.  The figure highlights that CLIP and Safe-CLIP fail to distinguish between text and image embeddings.  MERU shows some separation between text and image embeddings, but HySAC demonstrates a clear separation not only between text and image embeddings but also between safe and unsafe content. This visual representation effectively illustrates the key difference between HySAC and previous approaches to safety-aware content management in vision-language models.", "section": "5.2.2.

The distributions are shown as histograms for safe text, safe images, unsafe text, and unsafe images.
