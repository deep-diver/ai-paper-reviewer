While acknowledging the effectiveness of data synthesis from seed questions or knowledge bases, it points out the lack of high-quality, large-scale open-sourced data and affordable synthesis methods.  The authors categorize existing reasoning data synthesis approaches into question-driven and knowledge-driven methods. Question-driven methods, such as question rephrasing and back-translation, are criticized for their limited diversity and scalability. Knowledge-driven methods, while offering improved diversity by leveraging knowledge bases or concept graphs, suffer from the high cost associated with using strong models like GPT-4 for data synthesis.  This gap in the open-source community motivates the introduction of ScaleQuest, a novel and scalable data synthesis method that uses smaller, open-source models to generate high-quality reasoning datasets from scratch without the need for seed data or complex augmentation constraints.

It leverages lightweight, open-source models, avoiding the expense of using powerful models like GPT-4.  The process starts with a two-stage question-tuning process: Question Fine-Tuning (QFT) and Question Preference Optimization (QPO). QFT activates the question-generation capability of the problem-solving models using a small set of problems (around 15K).  QPO, utilizing an external LLM (GPT-4-mini in this case), refines the generated questions focusing on solvability and difficulty.  A filtering process then removes low-quality questions based on language, solvability, and difficulty, resulting in a dataset of 1 million high-quality question-answer pairs.  This approach allows for significant scalability compared to existing methods that rely on strong, costly models or limited data augmentation techniques.
