It eschews reliance on expensive, large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, instead leveraging smaller, open-source models. The core of ScaleQuest involves a two-stage process: Question Fine-Tuning (QFT) and Question Preference Optimization (QPO).  QFT uses a small set of problems to activate the question generation capability within the smaller model. Then, QPO leverages an external LLM (GPT-4-mini in the experiments) to iteratively refine the generated questions, focusing on two key aspects: solvability (ensuring questions have solutions) and difficulty (generating varied difficulty levels).  A filtering process further enhances the quality of questions generated, removing nonsensical or poorly formulated questions. This comprehensive approach resulted in a dataset of 1 million question-answer pairs, which significantly improved the performance of mainstream open-source models on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, achieving performance gains ranging from 29.2% to 46.4%.  The response generation process incorporates generating multiple responses and selecting the highest-quality response according to a reward model.", "first_cons": "The reliance on an external LLM for QPO, albeit a smaller model like GPT-4-mini, introduces a dependency and potential cost, although significantly less than using a large LLM for the entire process.

It begins by describing the training process for two problem-designer models, DeepSeek-QGen and Qwen2-Math-QGen, using a combined dataset of GSM8K and MATH problems.  The models were trained for only one epoch to avoid overfitting and promote diversity in generated questions.  Then, the process of generating and filtering two million questions is explained; language filtering, solvability filtering, and difficulty sampling were employed, resulting in a refined dataset of one million high-quality question-answer pairs. Response generation was performed using Qwen2-Math-7B-Instruct with chain-of-thought prompting.  The models were then fine-tuned on the constructed dataset, along with other publicly available datasets for comparison (MetaMath, DART-Math, NuminaMath), and evaluated on four benchmarks: GSM8K, MATH, College Math, and Olympiad Bench. The results showed significant performance improvements (5.6% to 11.5% average improvement over the prior state-of-the-art across benchmarks) across various models, with Qwen2-Math-7B-ScaleQuest achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo in zero-shot settings.  An ablation study validated the effectiveness of each component of the ScaleQuest methodology, with QFT, QPO, and reward filtering all contributing significantly.  The scalability of the method is also assessed through experiments with varying data sizes on Llama3-8B, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods, especially for out-of-domain evaluations.
