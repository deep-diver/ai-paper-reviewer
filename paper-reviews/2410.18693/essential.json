Unlike previous approaches that rely on expensive, closed-source models or complex augmentation techniques, ScaleQuest leverages readily available, smaller open-source models to generate a million problem-solution pairs from scratch.  The efficiency and low cost of this approach are key advantages.  The generated dataset significantly outperforms existing open-source datasets in improving the performance of various LLMs on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.  The researchers demonstrate that simply fine-tuning a base model with their dataset can surpass even strong, closed-source models like GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3.5 Sonnet. This work addresses a major bottleneck in LLM development \u2013 the lack of affordable, high-quality data \u2013 and paves the way for increased open-source contributions to the field."}
