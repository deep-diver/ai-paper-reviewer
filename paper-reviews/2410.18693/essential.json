Unlike previous methods that rely on large, expensive models or require complex augmentation techniques, ScaleQuest cleverly leverages smaller, open-source LLMs to generate questions from scratch.  The researchers used ScaleQuest to automatically create a massive dataset of 1 million problem-solution pairs in the realm of mathematical reasoning.  This dataset proved to be highly effective, significantly boosting the performance of several mainstream open-source LLMs (by 29.2% to 46.4% on the MATH benchmark).  Remarkably, fine-tuning a smaller model with this newly generated dataset even outperformed larger, closed-source models like GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3.5 on certain tasks.  ScaleQuest addresses the scarcity of high-quality open-source data and provides a cost-effective solution for researchers seeking to advance LLM reasoning capabilities."}
