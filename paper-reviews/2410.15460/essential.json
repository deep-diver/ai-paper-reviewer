This paper investigates the relationship between the training process and hallucinations.  The researchers found that hallucination rates oscillate throughout training, and this variability isn't easily fixed by just reducing general training loss.  They propose a new training method called Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND) that addresses this issue by identifying and selectively removing neurons that exhibit significant variability during training.  This method is shown to significantly reduce hallucinations across different LLM sizes, and it is made more efficient through the use of a new metric called Efficient EigenScore (EES).  The empirical results demonstrate that SeND can improve LLM reliability by up to 40% while also being computationally efficient.  The research highlights the importance of considering the training process itself when trying to improve the reliability of LLMs."}
