The section points out that current research primarily focuses on post-hoc detection and mitigation, neglecting the role of the training process itself. This research aims to address this gap by investigating the relationship between the training process and the emergence of hallucinations in LLMs.  They mention confabulations, a specific type of hallucination where the LLM generates different responses to the same or similar inputs, as a particular focus.

The analysis revealed consistent oscillatory patterns across different model sizes, demonstrating that the variance in factual accuracy fluctuates throughout the training process, contradicting the assumption that minimizing loss alone ensures factual accuracy.  This fluctuating behavior is observed across various model sizes (70M to 12B parameters) and evaluation metrics (SelfCheckGPT and ROUGE-1), indicating that the phenomenon is robust and not solely dependent on a specific metric or model size.  The findings emphasize the uncertainty inherent in using training loss convergence as the sole criterion for halting training, particularly regarding the issue of confabulations - the tendency to generate different answers given the same input. The research highlights that the reduction in training loss doesn't necessarily align with a decrease in hallucinations, indicating that the optimization process alone is not enough to resolve the issue of factual accuracy.
