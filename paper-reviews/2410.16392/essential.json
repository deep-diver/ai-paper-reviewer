Compound AI systems combine LLMs with other components like retrievers or code interpreters, making their behavior highly dependent on parameters like instructions or tool definitions.  Traditionally, these parameters are tuned manually, which is time-consuming and challenging.  This paper introduces a novel approach that uses an LLM as the optimizer. This is efficient because LLMs can directly generate optimized parameters, avoiding the need for computationally expensive gradient calculations. The survey categorizes optimization approaches based on the analogy of program analysis. Static analysis involves optimizing based on the system's structure without runtime execution, while dynamic analysis considers the system's runtime behavior.  The paper also explores various applications of this LLM-based optimization across different compound AI systems, including question-answering, mathematical problem-solving, and sequential decision making.  The authors emphasize the broader implications of this approach, including improved process supervision and enhanced safety in AI systems.  This method offers a way to better manage the complexity of compound AI systems, resulting in more robust and efficient AI applications."}
