These systems combine LLMs with other components like retrievers or code interpreters. The core idea is that instead of manually tweaking parameters, an LLM acts as an optimizer.  The paper introduces a new way to understand how this LLM-based optimization works, drawing an analogy from computer science: it uses concepts like 'static' and 'dynamic' program analysis to explain how you instruct the LLM to find the best parameters.  'Static' means giving the LLM all the necessary information upfront to make the optimization, while 'dynamic' means the LLM gets feedback based on how the system performs, allowing it to iteratively improve.  The paper covers several examples and discusses the potential broader impact of this approach, including applications in question answering, mathematical problem-solving, and making decisions.  The authors also highlight challenges and opportunities for future research, including ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems."}
