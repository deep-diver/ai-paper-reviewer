These 'compound AI systems' combine LLMs with other components like code interpreters or tools. Traditionally, optimizing these systems involved manually adjusting parameters, which is time-consuming and complex. This paper introduces a new method: using an LLM as the optimizer. The LLM receives the task description and dataset and automatically generates or refines the system's parameters to improve performance.  The paper also draws a useful analogy between this optimization process and program analysis (a field in computer science) \u2013 specifically, static (without running the program) and dynamic (by running the program and observing its behavior) program analysis.  The researchers examine various types of compound AI systems and discuss the potential impact and limitations of this new approach, proposing backpropagation and trace propagation as efficient credit assignment methods for handling multiple parameters simultaneously.  Overall, the paper highlights the potential of LLMs for efficient and adaptable optimization in the rapidly growing field of compound AI systems."}
