The authors emphasize that a single system can handle multiple tasks through parameter adjustments, making task-based categorization less relevant.  Three core archetypes of compound AI systems are detailed:\n\n1.  **LLM with Tools:**  LLMs generate structured outputs (like JSON) to interact with external APIs or execute functions. Optimization here involves teaching the LLM when and how to utilize these tools effectively.  The implementation of the functions can also be refined.\n2.  **LLM with Code Interpreter:**  The LLM generates executable code (e.g., Python, SQL) that a code interpreter runs, enabling the system to perform complex computational steps.  Optimization focuses on instructing the LLM on efficient code generation and tool usage within the code.\n3.  **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** LLMs are coupled with retrievers to ground their responses in external knowledge.  Optimization here involves crafting instructions for both querying the retriever and utilizing the retrieved information effectively,  with two approaches highlighted: the agentic setup (dynamic number of retrieval steps) and the multi-hop setup (fixed number of steps).  Additionally, methods for refining the queries sent to the retriever are explained.\n\nA fourth type, **Search with LLM calls**, explores techniques like self-consistency (multiple LLM calls, majority vote), chained calls (incremental context addition), and tree search methods (generator and evaluator LLMs) for improved performance and broader search spaces.  This showcases how increasing the number of LLM calls impacts system behavior.", "first_cons": "The section's focus on system archetypes based on parameterization rather than tasks might limit its immediate applicability for researchers primarily concerned with specific tasks.

It draws an analogy to program analysis, categorizing the optimization process into static and dynamic approaches.\n\n- **Static program analysis** involves prompting the LLM with input-output pairs from the training data, and the LLM generates parameters based solely on this information without executing the compound AI system. Several methods are mentioned for synthesizing instructions, reasoning structures, and tools (Zhou et al., 2023c; Schnabel and Neville, 2024; Yang et al., 2024a).\n\n- **Dynamic program analysis**, in contrast, involves executing the compound AI system and using its runtime behavior (textual feedback) to guide the LLM optimizer.  The section highlights the challenge of credit assignment in optimizing multiple dependent parameters and introduces two approaches: backpropagation and trace propagation. Backpropagation involves iteratively updating each parameter individually, while trace propagation uses the full execution trace to update all parameters simultaneously.\n\n- The section illustrates the concept through backpropagation and trace propagation algorithms, showing how the LLM optimizer is prompted and how it generates the updated parameters based on textual feedback.
