It introduces four main archetypes: LLMs with tools, LLMs with code interpreters, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and systems using multiple LLM calls.  Each archetype is described in detail, highlighting the parameters that can be modified to adapt the system to various tasks.  The discussion emphasizes the importance of prompt engineering and the parameters involved, such as instructions for LLMs, tool definitions, and the number of steps involved in multi-hop RAG systems.  The choice of the LLM itself and the parameters of various components is also crucial for the overall system performance.  The authors clarify that while they don't categorize tasks, they organize by system architectures because many different tasks can be addressed through simply modifying parameters, making task-based categorization less useful.  The goal is to lay the groundwork for understanding how LLMs can be used to optimize these systems later in the paper.", "first_cons": "The section primarily focuses on describing different architectural designs of compound AI systems without delving into the optimization strategies until later sections.

It emphasizes the black-box nature of this optimization problem and introduces two primary approaches based on analogies from program analysis: static and dynamic program analysis.  Static analysis involves prompting the LLM with input-output pairs to generate optimal parameters without executing the system. Dynamic analysis, conversely, leverages the system's runtime behavior and textual feedback to iteratively refine parameters. The section further extends the dynamic approach to handle multiple dependent parameters, introducing credit assignment methods like backpropagation and trace propagation, which utilize the recorded computational graph during execution to guide parameter updates.  Both approaches utilize the LLM's capabilities to generate multiple solutions (exploiting the power of LLMs for generating creative and potentially complex solutions) and leverage evaluation strategies to select the best-performing parameters.", "first_cons": "The survey focuses exclusively on training-time optimization, neglecting instance-level optimization techniques which might be beneficial in specific scenarios.", "first_pros": "The analogy to program analysis provides a clear and unified framework for understanding different LLM-based optimization approaches, making the complex concepts more accessible.", "keypoints": ["The use of LLMs as optimizers offers an efficient alternative to gradient-based or RL-based techniques, avoiding gradient computation.", "Static program analysis prompts the LLM with input-output pairs to generate parameters; dynamic program analysis uses runtime behavior and textual feedback for iterative refinement.", "Credit assignment methods, such as backpropagation and trace propagation, are used to handle multiple dependent parameters in dynamic analysis.", "Both static and dynamic methods involve generating and evaluating multiple solutions to find the best parameters.
