Quantizing model parameters to 4-bits is a promising solution for efficiency, but it introduces significant challenges due to the sensitivity of weights and activations to such aggressive quantization. \nSVDQuant tackles this issue with a novel approach. It leverages low-rank decomposition to absorb outliers in weights and activations, easing the burden on quantization. Further, it uses a co-designed inference engine called Nunchaku to fuse kernels and optimize memory access, dramatically increasing speed without sacrificing image quality.  Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SVDQuant, showing significant memory reduction (3.5x) and latency improvement (3x) compared to state-of-the-art methods on various diffusion models.  The open-sourced nature of the accompanying library and engine makes SVDQuant readily accessible for wider adoption.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}}
