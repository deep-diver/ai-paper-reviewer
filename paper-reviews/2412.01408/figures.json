The results are presented as a heatmap, where each cell represents the accuracy achieved for a specific language and a given shot size (number of training examples).  Different colors in the heatmap represent different accuracy levels, ranging from low (darker shades) to high (lighter shades).  The x-axis represents the shot size (50, 100, 150, 200), and the y-axis represents the ten different Indian languages used in the ADIMA dataset.
