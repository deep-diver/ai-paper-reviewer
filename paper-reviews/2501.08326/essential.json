Existing methods either rely on bounding boxes (which scale poorly) or frame-specific features (missing temporal context). \nOmni-RGPT introduces \"Token Marks\", a novel method for consistent region representation across spatiotemporal dimensions.  It uses region prompts (boxes or masks) to embed tokens directly into spatial regions and the text prompt. An auxiliary task further enhances robustness in videos.  The model achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in unifying image and video region understanding.  A large-scale video instruction dataset (RegVID-300k) is also introduced.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08326/podcast.wav"}
