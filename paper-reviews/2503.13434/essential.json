These methods face challenges in decoupling visual elements, layout control, identity preservation, visual harmony, and data scarcity. Existing benchmarks also don't comprehensively evaluate element-level manipulations.\n\nThis paper introduces **BlobCtrl, a unified framework for element-level image generation and editing using a probabilistic blob-based representation**. A dual-branch diffusion model and self-supervised training enables flexible manipulation. The authors also present **BlobData, a large-scale dataset and BlobBench, a rigorous evaluation benchmark** to facilitate future research.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.13434/podcast.wav"}
