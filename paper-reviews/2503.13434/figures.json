Geometrically, a blob is depicted as an ellipse, defined by its center coordinates (Cx, Cy), the lengths of its minor and major axes (a, b), and its orientation (\u03b8).  Simultaneously, it's statistically modeled as a two-dimensional Gaussian distribution, parameterized by its mean (\u03bc) and covariance matrix (\u03a3).
