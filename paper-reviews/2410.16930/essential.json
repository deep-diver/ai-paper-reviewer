Unlike previous methods, MathNeuro uses only the model's forward pass (how the model processes information), making it computationally efficient and applicable to massive models.  The method identifies parameters vital for math by comparing their importance for math problems versus other tasks.  Experiments showed that removing these math-specific parameters eliminates the model's ability to solve math problems, while scaling up these parameters surprisingly improves its math performance by 4-17% on a standard math benchmark (GSM8K). Importantly, these manipulations don't negatively impact the model's performance on non-math tasks.  This research opens avenues for targeted LLM improvement in math and potentially other specific skill areas."}
