This is achieved by comparing parameter importance scores obtained from both math-related and unrelated inputs. By isolating these math-specific parameters, MathNeuro allows for targeted interventions, such as pruning or scaling, to directly impact a model's mathematical abilities without significantly affecting its performance on other tasks. The effectiveness of MathNeuro is demonstrated using various LLMs (1-8B parameters), showing significant improvement in math performance (4-17% on GSM8K) after scaling and minimal impact on non-math tasks after pruning.  Furthermore, MathNeuro's data efficiency is highlighted: most of its efficacy is retained even when using a single sample for parameter identification.
