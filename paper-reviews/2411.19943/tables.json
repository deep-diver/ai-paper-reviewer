The methods include several baselines (SFT, DPO, TokenDPO, DPO+RPO) and the authors' proposed method, cDPO.  Results are shown for three different language models (Llama-3 8B, Llama-3 70B, and DeepSeek-math 7B).  The table reports accuracy scores, demonstrating that the cDPO method significantly outperforms all other methods across all models and datasets.  The asterisk (*) indicates that the performance difference between cDPO and other methods is statistically significant (p < 0.005).", "section": "4.

The key variable is the threshold (top-p) used for selecting incorrect answer trajectories to train the negative model for contrastive estimation. Different top-p values (25%, 50%, 75%) represent varying proportions of incorrect trajectories included in the training data. The table shows how the accuracy of the cDPO method changes based on this threshold selection, allowing an analysis of the effect of different levels of negative training data on the overall performance.", "section": "4.3.
