Gathering diverse datasets for varying mask layouts is difficult. This limits the ability to edit specific facial regions effectively for different applications. \n\nThis paper introduces **FFaceNeRF, which uses a geometry adapter with feature injection and LMTA for mask adaptation, enabling effective manipulation with as few as 10 samples.** This enables training on adapted mask layouts. In addition, the method utilizes an overlap-based optimization process for precise editing of small regions. Experiments demonstrate improved flexibility, control, and image quality compared to existing mask-based methods.", "affiliation": "KAIST, Visual Media Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17095/podcast.wav"}
