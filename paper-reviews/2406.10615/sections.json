However, current IL methods require many high-quality demonstrations, making them expensive. This paper aims to improve sample efficiency in robotic manipulation by focusing on better visual and action representations.  The core idea is to leverage **action locality**, the concept that a robot's actions primarily depend on the target object and its immediate environment, rather than relying on global scene understanding which previous works have done, leading to low sample efficiency.  This is analogous to the inductive biases used in other ML fields like CNNs or RNNs, which greatly enhance sample efficiency.", "first_cons": "Prevailing imitation learning techniques require many demonstrations, which is expensive.", "first_pros": "Imitation learning enables increasingly complex robot manipulation skills.", "keypoints": ["High cost of data collection in robotics", "Importance of sample efficiency", "Inductive bias: **action locality** (actions depend on target object and local environment)", "Global scene representation is inefficient", "Inspired by inductive biases in CNNs and RNNs"], "second_cons": "Existing methods for robotic manipulation learning primarily use global scene representation, which is data inefficient.", "second_pros": "Introducing inductive bias improves sample efficiency in other ML domains.", "summary": "This paper introduces the concept of action locality as a critical inductive bias to improve sample efficiency in robotic manipulation, contrasting it with previous methods that rely on less efficient global scene representations."}}, {"page_end_idx": 3, "page_start_idx": 3, "section_number": 3, "section_title": "Method", "details": {"details": "This section details the methodologies employed in SGRv2, a sample-efficient framework for robotic manipulation.
