We evaluate SGR and SGRv2 on 26 RLBench tasks, with demonstration numbers ranging from 100 to 5. Results indicate that, owing to the locality of SGRv2, it exhibits exceptional sample efficiency, with its success rate declining by only about 10%. Top Right: Overview of simulation results. We test SGRv2 on 3 benchmarks, consistently outperforming the baselines. Bottom Right: Tasks of the 3 simulation benchmarks.", "description": "The chart compares the sample efficiency of SGRv2 and SGR across different numbers of demonstrations on 26 RLBench tasks, highlighting SGRv2's superior performance and its ability to maintain high success rates even with limited data.", "section": "4 Simulation Setup"}]
