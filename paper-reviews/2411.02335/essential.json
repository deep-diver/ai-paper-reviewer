Reducing these improves efficiency and interpretability. However, existing research lacks a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing activation sparsity. This paper investigates this gap by focusing on decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs.\n\nThe researchers propose a new metric, PPL-p% sparsity, to precisely measure activation sparsity while considering model performance.  Through extensive experiments, they uncover several scaling laws describing the relationship between activation sparsity and training data, activation functions, and architectural design. These findings provide valuable insights into designing LLMs with significantly greater activation sparsity, ultimately paving the way towards more efficient and interpretable AI.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
