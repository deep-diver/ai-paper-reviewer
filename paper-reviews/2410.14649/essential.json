This paper introduces EvoPress, a new approach to compressing LLMs that's both more accurate and efficient than existing methods.  Current LLM compression techniques often rely on heuristics (rules of thumb) that assume the total compression error is simply the sum of individual layer errors.  This is incorrect; EvoPress overcomes this limitation.  It uses evolutionary search, a type of algorithm that iteratively refines solutions based on their performance, to find the optimal compression levels for each layer of the model, minimizing the impact on accuracy.  EvoPress was tested on multiple LLMs and across various compression methods (like removing parts of the network, reducing the precision of numbers used, and making the network sparser) and consistently outperformed existing approaches in terms of accuracy vs. the amount of compression achieved.  Importantly, EvoPress has theoretical guarantees of finding a good solution and does so efficiently; this is a major advance since evaluating even a single, compressed LLM can take a long time. The code for EvoPress is publicly available, which makes it easy for other researchers to use and extend."}
