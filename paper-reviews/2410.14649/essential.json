This paper introduces EvoPress, a new method for compressing LLMs more effectively.  Existing methods typically compress models uniformly, but EvoPress dynamically adjusts the compression level for different parts of the model (e.g., layers or blocks). This allows for better performance since some parts of the model are more important than others and don't need as much compression.  EvoPress uses an evolutionary search algorithm that explores different compression strategies and finds the best one.  The researchers demonstrate that EvoPress consistently outperforms other methods on several benchmark LLMs.  They also prove that their algorithm converges to an optimal solution, meaning it is guaranteed to find a good compression strategy. This is important because other similar methods often rely on assumptions that may not always be true."}
