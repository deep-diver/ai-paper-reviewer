{"importance": "This paper is important because it presents **CaPa**, a novel and efficient method for generating high-quality 3D assets. This addresses a critical need in various fields, such as gaming, film, and VR/AR, where high-quality 3D models are in high demand. The efficiency of CaPa makes it particularly relevant to researchers working on scalable and practical solutions for 3D content creation, opening up new avenues for research in areas such as geometry and texture generation and improving the overall quality and speed of 3D asset production.", "summary": "CaPa: Carve-n-Paint Synthesis generates hyper-realistic 4K textured meshes in under 30 seconds, setting a new standard for efficient 3D asset creation.", "takeaways": ["CaPa, a two-stage framework, efficiently generates high-fidelity 3D assets by decoupling geometry and texture synthesis.", "Spatially Decoupled Cross Attention synthesizes high-resolution textures (up to 4K) and resolves multi-view inconsistencies.", "3D-aware occlusion inpainting generates cohesive results across the entire model, even in complex scenarios."], "tldr": "Generating high-quality 3D assets is crucial for many applications but existing methods are often slow, inefficient, or produce low-fidelity results.  Current approaches struggle with multi-view inconsistencies, slow generation times, and issues with surface reconstruction.  These challenges hinder the progress of 3D generative models and limit their practical applications.\nCaPa tackles these problems with a two-stage \"carve-and-paint\" approach.  It uses a 3D latent diffusion model to generate geometry guided by multi-view inputs, ensuring structural consistency.  A novel Spatially Decoupled Attention then synthesizes high-resolution textures.  Finally, a 3D-aware occlusion inpainting algorithm fills untextured regions, resulting in high-quality outputs.  CaPa excels in both texture fidelity and geometric stability, generating ready-to-use 3D assets in under 30 seconds.", "affiliation": "Graphics AI Lab, NC Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.09433/podcast.wav"}
