{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it **reveals limitations of current vision-language models** in process reward modeling. The work **introduces a new benchmark, VILBENCH, to foster research in this area** and **provides a vision-language PRM, ViLPRM**, as a promising direction for future exploration. By identifying the challenges and providing resources, the paper helps facilitate advances in multimodal AI.", "summary": "VILBENCH: Vision-Language Process Reward Modeling Suite", "takeaways": ["Current VLLMs struggle to consistently excel as reward models across diverse vision-language tasks, highlighting a gap between general capabilities and reward assessment.", "The VILBENCH benchmark reveals that advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only 27.3% accuracy, emphasizing the need for intensive process reward signals.", "The ViLPRM model demonstrates improved performance over standard CoT and untrained counterparts on VILBENCH, showcasing the potential of fine-grained reward modeling."], "tldr": "Process-supervised reward models offer detailed feedback to model responses, which is key for complex tasks. Despite advantages, PRM evaluation in multimodal contexts is lacking. The study benchmarks vision large language models as reward models, and finds no consistent outperformance across tasks. VLLMs do not inherently yield better rewarding performance. To address this, the paper introduces VILBENCH, a vision-language benchmark that requires process reward signals. \n\n The paper also presents a vision-language PRM, ViLPRM, trained using 73.6K vision-language process reward data. MCTS enhances the PRM by using a tree-search algorithm. The PRM improves stepwise reward evaluation accuracy. The 3B model surpasses standard chain-of-thought approaches, improving by 3.3%, and outperforming its counterpart in VILBENCH by 2.5% when selecting OpenAI-generated solutions.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Cruz", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20271/podcast.wav"}
