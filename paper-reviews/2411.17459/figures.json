The WF-VAE consists of two main parts: a conventional backbone network and a dedicated energy flow pathway. The pathway is designed to prioritize the transmission of low-frequency information directly to the latent representation, bypassing some of the processing steps in the main backbone. This efficient transfer of crucial video data is achieved through wavelet transforms that decompose the input video into multiple frequency components.  The low-frequency components are channeled through the pathway, while higher frequency components are handled by the backbone. This design helps to reduce computational costs and preserve crucial video information in the latent space, leading to improved efficiency and reconstruction quality.", "section": "3.2.
