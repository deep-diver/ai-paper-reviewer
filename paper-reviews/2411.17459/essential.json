The block-wise inference methods typically used also lead to **discontinuities in the latent space** when processing long videos, causing artifacts.  These challenges increase the training cost and reduce the quality of video generated. \n\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes WF-VAE. This novel VAE uses wavelet transformation to decompose videos into various frequency bands and focuses mainly on the low-frequency information. This results in **significantly improved encoding efficiency**. Additionally, a new method called Causal Cache is introduced to maintain the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference, resolving discontinuities.  The results demonstrated that WF-VAE outperforms existing VAEs in terms of quality and efficiency, showing a 2x improvement in throughput and 4x reduction in memory consumption.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2411.17459/podcast.wav"}
