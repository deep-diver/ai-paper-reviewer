The post-training experiments assess SeerAttention's performance on pre-trained models (Llama-3.1-8B and Mistral-7B-v0.3) using different datasets (ProofPile and PG19) and various sparsity ratios.  The results demonstrate minimal perplexity increases even with high sparsity ratios (up to 90%), indicating that SeerAttention can achieve significant sparsity without substantial accuracy loss. For instance, on the Mistral-7B model at a 32k context length, SeerAttention achieves a perplexity of 2.45 with 90% sparsity, compared to a baseline of 2.29.  Longer context lengths actually allow for greater sparsity with minimal accuracy degradation. Comparisons against state-of-the-art methods (MoA and MInference) showcase SeerAttention's superiority in terms of accuracy and flexibility.  The long-context fine-tuning experiments integrate SeerAttention with YaRN to extend the Llama-3-8B model from 8k to 32k context length. The results highlight near-lossless performance at 50% sparsity and minimal loss at 90%, demonstrating adaptability to different context lengths and sparsity ratios.  Finally, the section evaluates the efficiency, showing kernel-level and end-to-end speedups over existing methods. SeerAttention achieves a remarkable 5.67x speedup at 90% sparsity at a 32k context length.\n\nThe efficiency analysis goes beyond just reporting speedups; it delves into the breakdown of latency contributions to demonstrate the minimal overhead introduced by SeerAttention's gating mechanism and Top-k operations. Kernel-level improvements are highlighted with comparisons showing  substantial gains compared to other methods like MoA and MInference. End-to-end speedups confirm the practical advantages, emphasizing that the theoretical gains translate into actual improvements in inference time.  A comprehensive evaluation of different pooling methods within the AttnGate, an essential component of SeerAttention,  shows that average pooling for Q and a combination of max and min pooling for K performs best, highlighting the impact of component selection on performance.\n\nIn summary, the experiments provide a comprehensive and compelling case for SeerAttention, demonstrating its effectiveness across diverse scenarios, sparsity ratios, context lengths, and even different model architectures.
