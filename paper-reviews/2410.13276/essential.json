This paper introduces SeerAttention, a new method that leverages the inherent sparsity in attention maps.  Instead of using predefined sparsity patterns, SeerAttention learns the sparsity directly from the data, resulting in a more adaptable and efficient approach.  The authors developed a specialized FlashAttention implementation to facilitate the learning process. Experiments show SeerAttention outperforms existing sparse attention methods in both post-training and fine-tuning settings, achieving remarkable speedups (up to 5.67x) with minimal loss in accuracy, even at very high sparsity levels (90%).  This is achieved by using a learnable gate to select important blocks in the attention map, treating the rest as sparse.  The method shows adaptability to various context lengths and sparsity ratios.  Overall, SeerAttention offers a promising way to improve the efficiency and scalability of LLMs without significant sacrifices in performance."}
