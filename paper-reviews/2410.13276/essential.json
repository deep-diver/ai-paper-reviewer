This paper introduces SeerAttention, a novel attention mechanism that addresses this limitation by learning the inherent sparsity within attention maps. Unlike previous methods that use predefined patterns or heuristics, SeerAttention uses a learnable gate to dynamically select significant blocks in the attention map, treating the rest as sparse.  This block-level sparsity effectively balances accuracy and speed. To facilitate efficient training, the authors developed a customized FlashAttention implementation that extracts the block-level ground truth with minimal overhead.  Experiments demonstrate SeerAttention's superiority over existing sparse attention methods in both post-training and long-context fine-tuning settings, achieving remarkable speedups (up to 5.67x) with minimal perplexity increase even at high sparsity ratios (90%).  The learned sparsity patterns were also found to be diverse and adaptive, showcasing the method's versatility and robustness."}
