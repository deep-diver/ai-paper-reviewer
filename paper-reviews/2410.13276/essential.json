This paper introduces SeerAttention, a novel attention mechanism that addresses this by learning the inherent sparsity in attention maps.  Instead of pre-defining sparsity patterns, SeerAttention uses a learnable gate to dynamically select important attention blocks, treating the rest as sparse.  To make this learning efficient, the authors created a customized version of the FlashAttention algorithm, which is known for its speed and minimal memory usage, to efficiently extract the needed information during training without the overhead of calculating the full attention map.  Experiments showed that SeerAttention significantly outperforms existing sparse attention methods in both post-training and fine-tuning scenarios.  Even at 90% sparsity, SeerAttention achieved minimal perplexity loss and impressive speedups (up to 5.67x compared to FlashAttention-2), demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness in handling long-context LLMs."}
