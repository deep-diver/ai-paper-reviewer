This model is then fine-tuned on two new domains: Lua programming language and TinyStories, resulting in two new models (`Lua` and `TinyStories`).  These fine-tuned models are merged using spherical linear interpolation (SLERP), creating a fourth model (`LuaStories`).  Sparse autoencoders are trained on the MLP activations of each model to extract features.
