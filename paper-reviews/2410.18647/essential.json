A threshold exists where adding more demonstrations provides minimal benefit.", "Efficient data collection strategies exist for achieving high success rates with limited resources, enabling faster progress in real-world robotic manipulation."], "tldr": "This paper investigates whether data scaling laws, successful in fields like computer vision and natural language processing, apply to robotic manipulation.  Researchers collected over 40,000 demonstrations across many environments and objects, training policies using imitation learning.  Results show that policy performance improves with more training environments and objects, following an approximate power-law relationship. However, data diversity is far more impactful than the absolute number of demonstrations; beyond a certain threshold, extra data offers little benefit.  The study proposes an efficient data collection strategy, demonstrating that high success rates can be achieved with relatively modest resources.  This offers significant implications for creating generalizable robotic policies, paving the way for improved efficiency and scalability in robotics research."}
