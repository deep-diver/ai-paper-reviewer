Existing depth-pruning methods struggle to balance model efficiency and accuracy after removing layers. The difficulty arises from the high cost of fine-tuning pruned models and finding a balance between immediate loss and future performance.\n\nThis paper introduces TinyFusion, a new technique that overcomes these issues.  By incorporating a differentiable sampling process for layer masks and a co-optimized weight update, TinyFusion effectively learns to identify and preserve critical layers. **This learnable approach directly models and optimizes the post-fine-tuning performance, enabling superior recovery after pruning**. The results show that TinyFusion is efficient and generalizable, creating high-performing shallow transformers across different architectures with dramatically improved speed and substantially reduced training costs.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01199/podcast.wav"}
