Parameter-efficient tuning methods on pre-trained models can fall short due to poor fitting ability and deviation from the target domain. Training smaller models from scratch, despite requiring effective data use and strategic learning, can be an alternative. This approach reduces dependence on source domain knowledge, focusing on adapting to the specifics of downstream application.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a **resource-efficient dual-mask training framework (RDTF)** for multi-frame animated sticker generation (ASG). RDTF constructs a discrete frame generation network and uses a dual-mask data utilization strategy to improve data availability and diversity. A difficulty-adaptive curriculum learning method is proposed to smooth convergence. Experiments show RDTF quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms efficient-parameter tuning methods.", "affiliation": "Pattern Recognition Center, WeChat AI, Tencent", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17735/podcast.wav"}
