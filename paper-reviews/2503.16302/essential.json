VDMs struggle due to slow diffusion sampling and Variational Autoencoder (VAE) decoding. Existing methods for image acceleration are not suitable for VDM because of the different nature of the 3D meshes and latent spaces. Therefore, improving VDM speed is crucial for interactive applications.\n\nThis paper presents FlashVDM, a framework that accelerates both VAE and diffusion processes in VDMs. For diffusion acceleration, it uses Progressive Flow Distillation, achieving high-quality results with as few as 5 inference steps. For VAE acceleration, it introduces a lightning vecset decoder with Adaptive KV Selection and Hierarchical Volume Decoding. This design lowers FLOPs and decoding overhead, achieving over 45x speedup in VAE decoding and 32x speedup overall.", "affiliation": "MMLab, CUHK", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16302/podcast.wav"}
