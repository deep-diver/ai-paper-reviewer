The section then focuses on the inherent challenges of colonoscopic vision tasks, categorizing them into five distinct categories:\n\n1.  **Non-linear camera ego-motion:** The colonoscope's unpredictable movement during procedures creates challenges for image stabilization and motion compensation. \n2.  **Presence of medical instruments:** Instruments used during colonoscopies can obstruct the view and make analysis challenging. \n3.  **Limited observable field:** The colon's intricate folds and blind spots restrict the visible area, making thorough inspection difficult. \n4.  **Non-uniform illumination:** Variable and diffuse illumination, including reflections, makes analysis challenging. \n5.  **Variability in tissue appearance:** Constant movement of the colon, various diseases, and different anatomical features introduce significant variations in tissue color and texture, increasing the difficulty of detecting subtle abnormalities.\n\nThese challenges underscore the complexities involved in interpreting colonoscopy images and the need for advanced techniques to overcome these limitations, paving the way for the introduction of multimodal approaches in later sections.
