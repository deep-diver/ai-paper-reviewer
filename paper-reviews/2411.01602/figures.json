Given a text prompt and its corresponding generated image shown in the top left as input, DreamPolish first progressively constructs a fine-grained 3D geometry with\ncoherent and smoothed surface. Then, DreamPolish leverages DSD as the score distillation objective to guide the representation towards a domain with both consistent and photorealistic texture.", "description": "DreamPolish is a text-to-3D generation model.  The figure illustrates its two-stage process. First, a text prompt and corresponding generated image are input.  The model then progressively builds a detailed 3D geometry using multiple neural representations, ensuring a smooth and coherent surface. This is achieved through progressive construction and surface polishing stages, refining the model from a coarse initial representation to a finely detailed one.  Second,  domain score distillation (DSD) is used to improve the texture quality. DSD guides the model towards a domain in the latent space that produces both consistent and photorealistic textures, leveraging both classifier-free guidance (CFG) and variational distribution guidance. The figure shows the architecture highlighting the different components of the geometry and texture generation pipelines, illustrating the flow of information and the interaction between different modules.", "section": "4 Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.01602/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration on different score distillation strategies.

(a) shows the vanilla SDS method, which only provides guidance towards a zero-mean noise distribution, leading to less stable and less photorealistic results. (b) demonstrates VSD and BSD methods that leverage a variational domain for improved texture quality. By incorporating the information of the variational domain, the texture quality is improved, but stability is still a concern. (c) presents the proposed DSD method, which combines guidance from both an unconditional image domain and the variational domain, leading to improved stability and photorealism.
