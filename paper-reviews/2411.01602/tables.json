The metrics used for comparison include PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), and CLIP Score.  Higher values for PSNR and SSIM, and lower values for LPIPS, generally indicate better image quality.  CLIP Score measures the alignment between the generated image and the input text prompt, with higher values representing better alignment. The table highlights the best performance achieved for each metric by each model.", "section": "5.1 Experimental settings"}]
