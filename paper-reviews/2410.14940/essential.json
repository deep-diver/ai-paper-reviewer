It uses a three-stage process: Prompt Augmentation System (PAS), Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Preference Alignment.  PAS improves user query understanding, SFT enhances model dialogue abilities, and Preference Alignment aligns the model to human values.  The approach is evaluated using both internal and open-source benchmarks, showing significant improvement in instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and overall user experience compared to other LLMs and the models' unmodified versions.  The key contributions include detailed explanations of the alignment methods, the extensive dataset used, and the substantial performance improvements demonstrated through various evaluations. The authors also release one of the models, making it publicly available for further research."}
