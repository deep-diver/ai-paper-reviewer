While the performance of all models is relatively similar on simpler tasks, MobA demonstrates superior results in more challenging tasks, outperforming other models except for Human and GPT-40 + Human. This suggests that MobA is more efficient in handling complex cases. Additionally, the incorporation of both the Memory Module and Plan Module enhances performance, highlighting their respective contributions to the system's overall capability.", "description": "The chart displays a comparison of the performance of several GUI agents across different task types (easy, medium, hard, indirect, cross-app) in terms of completed tasks, milestone score ratio, and execution efficiency.", "section": "4.4 Results and Analysis"}]
