Prior methods like Rectified Flow attempted to speed this up by straightening ODE flow trajectories, but limitations remained, particularly in accurately learning straight trajectories and achieving optimal few-step generation. These limitations stemmed from approximating couplings (image and noise pairs) with constant velocity, which often resulted in suboptimal performance and curved sampling trajectories. \nTo address this, the authors introduce Constant Acceleration Flow (CAF), which models couplings using a simple constant acceleration equation instead of constant velocity.  CAF introduces acceleration as an additional learnable variable, enabling more accurate and expressive ODE flow estimation.  Moreover, to further improve accuracy, they propose two techniques: initial velocity conditioning for the acceleration model and a reflow process for the initial velocity.  Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CAF significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, exhibiting superior performance in both one-step and few-step generation while preserving coupling and inversion more effectively.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}}
