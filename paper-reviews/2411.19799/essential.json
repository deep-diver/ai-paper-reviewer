{"importance": "This paper is crucial because **it addresses the critical gap in multilingual LLM evaluation**.  Existing benchmarks often lack high-quality resources and ignore regional knowledge.  This work provides a valuable, large-scale, multilingual benchmark (INCLUDE) to evaluate LLMs' performance in real-world language environments, significantly advancing research in this area and fostering equitable AI development.", "summary": "New multilingual LLM benchmark, INCLUDE, tackles regional knowledge gaps by using 197K QA pairs from 44 languages, improving cross-lingual evaluation.", "takeaways": ["The INCLUDE benchmark offers a large-scale, comprehensive evaluation suite for multilingual LLMs, addressing the lack of high-quality resources in many languages.", "INCLUDE effectively measures LLMs' capabilities in various regional contexts, going beyond simple translation by incorporating regional and cultural knowledge.", "The findings highlight significant performance variations across languages and models, revealing the need for further development of multilingual LLMs and prompting strategies."], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) show performance disparities across languages, hindering their deployment in many regions.  This is largely due to a **lack of high-quality evaluation resources** in low-resource languages and the **neglect of regional and cultural nuances** in benchmark creation.  Current benchmarks often translate from English, ignoring cultural contexts.\nTo address this, the researchers created INCLUDE, a multilingual benchmark comprising **197,243 question-answer pairs** from diverse exams across **44 languages**.  INCLUDE tests LLMs' knowledge and reasoning abilities in various regional settings, using questions from educational and professional exams, thus evaluating performance in their intended environments. The **release of INCLUDE** provides a crucial resource for researchers and developers in the field.", "affiliation": "EPFL", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.19799/podcast.wav"}
