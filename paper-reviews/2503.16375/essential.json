Unlike indoor scenes, outdoor environments present unique challenges like varying heights and rapid landscape creation. Existing methods are limited by low geometric quality and scene variation. Solutions for unbounded indoor scenes struggle with skyscrapers and high memory usage, as they rely on spatially structured latents like triplanes or dense feature grids. Scaling these methods for outdoor environments results in inefficiency and detail loss. Datasets lack high-quality geometry and height variation, hindering effective model training.\n\nThis paper explores generating large outdoor scenes with **NuiScene**, ranging from castles to high-rises, through an efficient approach that encodes scene chunks as uniform vector sets for improved compression. An outpainting model is trained to enhance coherence and speed up the generation. The team curates a small but high-quality dataset, enabling joint training on scenes of varying styles. The work facilitates blending of different environments, such as rural houses and city skyscrapers within the same scene.", "affiliation": "Simon Fraser University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16375/podcast.wav"}
