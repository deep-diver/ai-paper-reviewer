{"reason": "This research introduces CIA, a novel cross-lingual auto evaluation suite for multilingual LLMs.  It addresses the scarcity of reference answers in non-English languages by training an evaluator LLM (HERCULE) to score responses based on English reference answers.", "summary": "CIA Suite enables reliable multilingual LLM evaluation by training an evaluator LLM on English references, achieving human-level performance across diverse languages.", "takeaways": ["Introduced CIA Suite: a cross-lingual auto evaluation framework for multilingual LLMs.", "HERCULE, a cross-lingual evaluation LLM, effectively scores responses using English references, even for low-resource languages.", "The study demonstrates the effectiveness of cross-lingual evaluation and provides a scalable approach for multilingual LLM assessment."], "tldr": "Assessing multilingual large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to the lack of evaluation resources in many languages. This paper introduces the Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, a new framework that tackles this problem.  CIA uses an evaluator LLM called HERCULE.  HERCULE is special because it doesn't need reference answers in the target language; it can learn to score responses by using readily available English references.  The researchers tested HERCULE on a new test set (RECON) with human annotations in six different languages.  Results showed HERCULE performs very well, aligning closely with human judgments, even surpassing other large language models in low-resource scenarios.  This suggests that CIA is a promising way to build more robust and scalable evaluations for multilingual LLMs."}
