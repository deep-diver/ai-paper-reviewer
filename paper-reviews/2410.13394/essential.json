{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on multilingual language model evaluation. It introduces a novel cross-lingual evaluation framework and benchmark, addressing the scarcity of multilingual evaluation resources.  The findings challenge existing assumptions about multilingual LLM capabilities and provide a scalable solution for future research in this critical area.", "summary": "New framework, CIA Suite, enables accurate, automated cross-lingual evaluation of multilingual LLMs using a novel test set and evaluator LLMs, bridging the gap in multilingual NLP assessment.", "takeaways": ["The CIA Suite offers a scalable and effective approach to cross-lingual LLM evaluation, overcoming limitations of existing English-centric methods.", "The newly introduced RECON test set and HERCULE evaluator LLMs provide a robust benchmark for assessing multilingual LLMs across various tasks and languages.", "Experiments demonstrate that cross-lingual evaluation models trained on INTEL significantly outperform proprietary LLMs, particularly in low-resource scenarios."], "tldr": "This research tackles the challenge of evaluating multilingual large language models (LLMs), a significant gap in current NLP research.  Existing methods primarily focus on English, leaving multilingual evaluation under-resourced.  The researchers introduce the Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, a novel framework that includes evaluator LLMs (HERCULE) and a new test set (RECON).  RECON contains 500 human-annotated instructions covering diverse tasks across six languages, along with human judgment scores. HERCULE, a cross-lingual model, addresses the lack of reference answers in target languages by using English references.  Experiments show HERCULE aligning closely with human judgments and performs better than commercial LLMs in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages.  The CIA Suite, including data and models, is publicly available. The work demonstrates the feasibility of using LLMs for cross-lingual evaluation, addressing a critical need for unbiased evaluation in multilingual NLP and providing a valuable resource for future research."}
