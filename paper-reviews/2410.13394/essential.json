The researchers introduce the \"Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite,\" a new framework that uses an evaluator LLM called HERCULE and a new test set called RECON.  HERCULE cleverly addresses the lack of reference answers in many languages by using English reference answers to learn how to score responses in other languages.  The RECON test set features human annotations for 500 instructions across six languages.  Experiments show that HERCULE performs very well, matching human judgments more closely than existing commercial models.  The authors also show that their method works surprisingly well even when evaluating languages not included in its training data (zero-shot evaluation). The entire framework (code, data, and models) is made publicly available to encourage further research."}
