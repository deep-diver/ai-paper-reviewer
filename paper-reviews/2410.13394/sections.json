Results) presents the evaluation of the Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) framework on the RECON test set. The analysis focuses on three main aspects:\n\n**5.1 Does Cross-Lingual Evaluation Work?:** This subsection investigates whether the cross-lingual evaluation approach is effective. It compares the performance of fine-tuned models (trained on INTEL) against zero-shot models (LLAMA-3.1-405B-I, GPT-40, GEMINI-1.5-PRO) across six languages (Bengali, German, French, Hindi, Telugu, and Urdu) using the Cohen's Kappa (\u03ba) score. The results show that fine-tuned models significantly outperform zero-shot counterparts, achieving higher \u03ba scores (e.g., HERCULE achieves an average \u03ba of 0.73 compared to GPT-40's 0.64).  The superior performance is evident even when the base model does not have adequate representation for certain languages. \n\n**5.2 Evaluation in the Wild:** To test the models in real-world conditions, human evaluations were conducted on a subset of 100 prompts per language from RECON, generating responses using three models (LLAMA-3.1-8B-I, GEMMA-2-2B, and GPT-40-MINI). Human annotators assessed these responses in their native languages. HERCULE demonstrates better alignment with human judgments than GPT-40 and GEMINI-1.5-PRO, especially in low-resource languages. The inter-annotator agreement (IAA) was also reasonable.\n\n**5.3 Qualitative Results:** This final subsection delves into a qualitative analysis of model predictions, focusing on instances where the difference between the LLM score and the true score is significant. It discusses the model's tendency to be more generous in awarding scores and provides examples illustrating scenarios where models rely heavily on their parameterized knowledge and sometimes disregard the reference answers, particularly for complex reasoning tasks.  The section also notes that some examples exceed the maximum sequence length of 4096 tokens, especially in Bengali and Telugu, potentially affecting the evaluation results.", "first_cons": "The qualitative analysis in section 5.3 is limited in scope.

Firstly, they assessed the performance of the model when evaluating languages unseen during training (zero-shot evaluation), demonstrating the effectiveness of cross-lingual transfer, with models trained on one language performing reasonably well on others (Table 3).  Secondly, they investigated the effect of reference answers, revealing that reference-based approaches are more accurate, even though using target-language references doesn't significantly improve performance compared to English references (Table 4). Thirdly, they compared different model choices for fine-tuning, finding that LoRA outperforms full fine-tuning in terms of efficiency while retaining comparable performance (Table 1, Table 5).
