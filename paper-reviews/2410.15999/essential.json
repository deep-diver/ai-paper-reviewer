This paper introduces SPARE, a new method that addresses this issue without needing to retrain the model. SPARE uses sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify and manipulate specific internal representations within the LLM that influence how it chooses between different sources of knowledge.  By selectively adjusting these internal representations, SPARE can guide the LLM to prioritize either its own internal knowledge or the information given in the current context. Experiments show that SPARE significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs in open-domain question-answering tasks where knowledge conflicts are present, surpassing other existing methods.  The use of SAEs allows for a more precise and targeted manipulation of the LLM's internal representations, leading to more effective control of its knowledge selection behavior."}
