This paper introduces SPARE, a novel method that addresses this issue without requiring any retraining of the LLM. SPARE leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify and modify internal LLM activations that influence knowledge selection. SAEs decompose complex LLM activations into simpler, more interpretable features. By carefully manipulating these features, SPARE can guide the LLM to prioritize either the contextual information or its internal knowledge, effectively resolving conflicts. Experiments on question-answering tasks show that SPARE significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in resolving knowledge conflicts and enhancing LLM performance.  The method is highly efficient, operating at inference time without the need for model retraining. This makes SPARE a practical solution for improving LLM performance in real-world applications where knowledge conflicts are common."}
