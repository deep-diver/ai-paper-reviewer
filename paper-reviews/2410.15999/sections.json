The problem setup centers on open-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks where large language models (LLMs) encounter knowledge conflicts\u2014situations where the model's internal knowledge contradicts the information provided in the context.  Each ODQA instance is represented as a tuple: (Q, EM, M, EC, C), where Q is the question, EM is evidence supporting the model's internal knowledge, M is the answer based on EM, EC is contradictory evidence, and C is the answer based on EC.  The section highlights the challenges inherent in LLMs relying on inaccurate information due to these conflicts.  To address the limitations of directly modifying dense, polysemantic LLM activations for improved knowledge selection, the authors introduce sparse autoencoders (SAEs) as a tool.  SAEs decompose complex activations into a large-scale monosemantic feature dictionary, making activation editing more precise and interpretable.
