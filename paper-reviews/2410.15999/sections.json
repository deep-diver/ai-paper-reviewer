The problem setup centers on open-domain question-answering (ODQA) tasks where the model's internal knowledge might conflict with the provided context, leading to inaccurate answers.  This conflict arises because LLMs store knowledge both in their parameters (parametric knowledge) and through provided context (contextual knowledge). The researchers aim to understand and address this conflict.  Sparse autoencoders are introduced as a tool for interpreting the complex internal representations of LLMs. SAEs decompose these complex representations into a large number of simpler, more easily interpretable monosemantic features. This decomposition will be crucial for the proposed method, SPARE, allowing for more precise manipulation of the LLM's internal activations.  The ODQA datasets used are characterized by instances containing a question (Q), evidence supporting memorized knowledge (EM), the memorized answer (M), conflicting evidence (Ec), and the answer based on the conflicting evidence (C).", "first_cons": "The explanation of sparse autoencoders could be more accessible to readers without a strong background in this specific type of neural network architecture.

The method involves three key steps: collecting activations exhibiting different knowledge selection behaviors, identifying functional SAE activations correlated with these behaviors, and finally, editing the internal activations of the LLM using the identified functional features to steer its knowledge selection.  Experiments show SPARE effectively controls LLM behavior to resolve knowledge conflicts, outperforming other representation engineering methods by +10% and contrastive decoding methods by +15%.  The core idea leverages the ability of SAEs to decompose complex, polysemantic activations into more easily interpretable, monosemantic features which can then be used to precisely adjust the LLM's internal states.\n\nThe collection of activations focuses on the final hidden state of the input sequence, the part believed to contain information relevant to generating the next token (the first answer token).  A linear probing method is employed to identify layers where knowledge conflict signals are most prominent (accuracy increases in mid-layers before decreasing in later layers), this aids in strategically choosing where within the LLM to apply the SAE-based intervention.  The selection of functional SAE features employs mutual information to gauge the strength of correlation between each feature and knowledge selection behavior. Finally, a constrained editing process modifies the activations to prioritize either contextual or parametric knowledge, depending on the desired outcome.   The constrained editing ensures that changes do not introduce unexpected behavior in other semantic features.\n\nThe method's effectiveness is demonstrated on open-domain question-answering datasets with knowledge conflicts. The results demonstrate that SPARE outperforms several existing methods, including TaskVec, ActAdd, SEA, DoLa, and CAD, not only in terms of accuracy but also in its ability to steer the model towards either contextual or parametric knowledge as needed.
