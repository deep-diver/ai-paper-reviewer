Unlike large language models (LLMs) that demand significant computational power, Shakti excels in efficiency and precision, making it ideal for edge AI applications in smartphones, wearables, and IoT systems.  Key to Shakti's performance are innovative techniques: Variable Grouped Query Attention (VGQA) reduces memory usage; SwiGLU activations improve training; and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) efficiently handle longer sequences.  Benchmarks show Shakti performs competitively against larger models while maintaining low latency and on-device efficiency, demonstrating its potential as a leading solution for edge AI applications in resource-constrained environments. It also supports multiple languages, including Hindi, Kannada, and Telugu, making it particularly suitable for multilingual contexts."}
