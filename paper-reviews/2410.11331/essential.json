Unlike large language models (LLMs) that demand significant computational resources, Shakti prioritizes efficiency and precision without sacrificing performance. Key innovations include Variable Grouped Query Attention (VGQA), which optimizes memory usage, and SwiGLU activation functions, which improve training stability.  Benchmarks show Shakti competes favorably against much larger models while excelling in multilingual and domain-specific tasks. The model's adaptability to handle long text sequences via Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) further enhances its usability. Its success is particularly impactful for industries needing low-latency, domain-specific insights on edge devices, such as healthcare, finance, and customer service."}
