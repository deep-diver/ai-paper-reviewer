It's optimized for speed and efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications where larger language models are impractical.  Key features include Variable Grouped Query Attention (VGQA) which reduces memory usage and speeds up processing, and SwiGLU activations to improve training.  Shakti also supports multiple languages and can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. Benchmark tests show it performs competitively against much larger models in various tests while maintaining low latency.  The researchers suggest several future directions, including multimodal integration and expanding its capabilities to address code generation and other tasks.  This model addresses the critical need for efficient AI solutions for edge computing and low-resource settings."}
