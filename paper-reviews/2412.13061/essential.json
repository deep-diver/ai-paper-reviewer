However, current video tokenizers often lack open access or struggle to balance performance and flexibility.  This hinders research in video-related fields like generation and understanding, where efficient representations are key. Existing methods often treat frames independently using image tokenizers.  This overlooks relationships between frames.  Other video-specific tokenizers may be closed-source or show limited performance. Thus, there is a need for efficient, adaptable, and publicly available tools for video tokenization.  This allows researchers to build on established tools.  Open access is crucial to speeding the field's growth.\nThis paper introduces **VidTok**, a new open-source video tokenizer designed to be both versatile and high-performing. It cleverly combines **2D convolutions for spatial processing and 3D convolutions for temporal fusion**. This hybrid architecture reduces computational costs without sacrificing quality. For discrete tokens, VidTok leverages **Finite Scalar Quantization (FSQ)**, enhancing training stability.  It also uses a **two-stage training strategy**, first training on low-resolution videos, then fine-tuning on higher resolutions. This method greatly speeds training. VidTok excels in both continuous and discrete tokenization benchmarks, beating current top performers. It is publicly available, aiming to be a cornerstone tool for future video research.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.13061/podcast.wav"}
