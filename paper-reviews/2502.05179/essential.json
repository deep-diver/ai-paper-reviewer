This is primarily due to the high computational cost of 3D attention mechanisms and the need for numerous function evaluations (NFEs). Single-stage models amplify these issues when generating high-resolution outputs, demanding considerable model capacity and NFEs. This creates challenges for practical applications. \nFlashVideo tackles these issues with a novel two-stage approach. The first stage uses a large model and sufficient NFEs to prioritize prompt fidelity at a lower resolution, focusing on generating accurate content and motion. The second stage leverages flow matching between low and high resolutions to add fine details, requiring only a few NFEs. This method dramatically reduces computational costs and wait times while improving efficiency, allowing for the generation of high-quality, high-resolution videos with reduced parameters and NFEs. This significantly enhances the commercial viability of T2V technology.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.05179/podcast.wav"}
