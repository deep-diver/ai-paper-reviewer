This slowness results from the time-consuming inversion and sampling steps involved.  Existing few-step methods, while faster, still don't reach the speed needed for real-time applications.\nSwiftEdit solves this by introducing a novel one-step inversion framework and a mask-guided editing technique with an attention rescaling mechanism. This approach enables instant text-guided image editing (in 0.23 seconds), significantly outperforming existing methods while maintaining competitive editing quality.  The method is demonstrated to be effective and efficient through extensive experiments, highlighting its potential for practical use.", "affiliation": "VinAI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.04301/podcast.wav"}
