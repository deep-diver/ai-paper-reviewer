The process involves using SAM for image segmentation, BLIP-2 for captioning objects, and then constructing a comprehensive social story.  This story, along with specific queries, is fed to LLMs. To improve the efficiency of the process, SocialGPT also introduces **Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO)**, an algorithm that performs a greedy search by using gradient information at the segment level to optimize prompts for the LLMs.  The modular nature of SocialGPT allows for adaptation of VFMs and LLMs separately, and the framework provides interpretable results in the form of language-based explanations generated by LLMs.", "first_cons": "Manual prompt design is tedious.", "first_pros": "Provides a strong baseline for social relation recognition, achieving competitive zero-shot results and offering interpretable answers.", "keypoints": ["Combines VFMs and LLMs for social relation reasoning", "Uses SAM and BLIP-2 for image processing and story generation", "Employs structured prompts (SocialPrompt) for LLMs", "Introduces GSPO for prompt optimization", "Achieves competitive zero-shot results with interpretable outputs"], "second_cons": "LLMs are sensitive to prompt variations; manual prompt design is time-consuming.", "second_pros": "The modular design allows for separate adaptation of VFMs and LLMs, bridging their gaps effectively.", "summary": "SocialGPT, a modular framework, uses Vision Foundation Models to generate a textual social story from images, which is then used by Large Language Models for reasoning, achieving competitive zero-shot results with interpretable answers, further enhanced by Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization."}}, {"page_end_idx": 6, "page_start_idx": 5, "section_number": 4, "section_title": "Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization", "details": {"details": "The core of this section is to tackle the challenge of long prompt optimization in LLMs for visual reasoning.  The authors cleverly transform a visual classification task into a generative task, which brings forth the issue of optimizing a long prompt. To address this, they propose **Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO)**, a method that uses gradient information at the segment level to guide a greedy search for the optimal prompt. Experiments show that GSPO significantly improves the performance of LLMs, making the approach more robust and generalizable to different image styles.  The method is presented as an iterative process, where at each iteration, the algorithm randomly samples data, computes the gradient of the loss function for each segment, and greedily selects the best replacement segment based on the gradient. This process continues until a satisfactory convergence point is reached.
