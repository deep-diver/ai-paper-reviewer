This paper introduces SocialGPT, a novel framework that combines the strengths of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for social relation reasoning.  VFMs are used to translate image content into textual descriptions, while LLMs perform text-based reasoning to identify relationships.  This modular approach allows for improved generalization and offers better interpretability.\nSocialGPT achieves competitive zero-shot performance on two benchmark datasets. However, the manual prompt design for the LLMs is time-consuming and tedious. To address this, the paper proposes Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), a novel method for automatically optimizing the prompts used by the LLMs.  GSPO significantly improves performance and generalizes to various image styles. The modular design, zero-shot capability, and automated prompt optimization make SocialGPT a significant advancement in social relation reasoning."}
