This paper introduces SocialGPT, a modular framework that combines the strengths of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) for image perception and Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning.  VFMs translate image content into a textual \"social story,\" which is then analyzed by LLMs to determine social relationships. This approach offers interpretability since LLMs can provide reasoning explanations.  \nHowever, manually designing effective prompts for LLMs is time-consuming. To address this, the paper presents Greedy Segment Prompt Optimization (GSPO), which utilizes gradient information to automatically optimize prompts segment-by-segment. This significantly improves performance and generalizes well across different image styles. SocialGPT, enhanced by GSPO, delivers highly competitive, zero-shot results on standard benchmarks, while maintaining interpretability and strong generalization capabilities. **This demonstrates the potential of using foundational models for complex visual reasoning tasks**."}
