A dedicated neural network is trained end-to-end with full training data. (b) We propose a modular framework with foundation models for social relation reasoning. Our proposed SocialGPT first employs VFMs to extract visual information into textual format, and then perform text-based reasoning with LLMs, using either our manually designed SocialPrompt or optimized prompts.", "description": "The figure compares and contrasts end-to-end learning-based frameworks for social relation reasoning with the proposed modular framework using foundation models.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
