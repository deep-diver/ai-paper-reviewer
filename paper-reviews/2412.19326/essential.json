Existing methods either develop tool-using approaches or unify visual tasks, but these often negatively impact the model's broader capabilities. \nTo overcome this, the paper introduces Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that leverages differentiable task preferences from fine-grained visual tasks.  **TPO uses learnable task tokens to connect multiple task-specific heads to the MLLM, significantly improving performance on various visual tasks through multi-task co-training.** The experimental results show that TPO achieves a substantial performance boost in MLLMs. This demonstrates TPO's ability to enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.19326/podcast.wav"}
