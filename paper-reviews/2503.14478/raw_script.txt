[{"Alex": "Hey everyone, and welcome to the podcast! Today, we're diving into the wild world of AI creativity \u2013 think robots writing poetry and AI judging art! Sounds crazy, right? We've got Jamie with us to help break it all down.", "Jamie": "Hey Alex, super excited to be here! AI and creativity? I'm intrigued and slightly terrified."}, {"Alex": "Exactly! So, Jamie, we're looking at a recent paper called 'Creation-MMBench.' In a nutshell, it's all about figuring out how good these fancy Multimodal Large Language Models \u2013 MLLMs \u2013 really are at being creative.", "Jamie": "MLLMs\u2026 okay, so like, AI that can understand both images and text? But\u2026creative? How does that even work?"}, {"Alex": "That's the million-dollar question! Think about it \u2013 we're used to AI acing logic tests and crunching data. But can it actually *create* something new and meaningful? This paper tries to measure that.", "Jamie": "Umm, so, how do you even begin to test something as subjective as creativity in an AI? It feels impossible."}, {"Alex": "Well, that\u2019s where Creation-MMBench comes in. The researchers designed a whole bunch of tasks \u2013 765 to be exact \u2013 where the AI has to be creative based on images. Think of it as a creative obstacle course for robots.", "Jamie": "Okay, 765 tasks... wow! What kind of tasks are we talking about? Like, asking an AI to draw something?"}, {"Alex": "Not exactly *draw*, but more like *imagine*. For example, they might show the AI a picture and ask it to write a short story inspired by the image, or come up with ad copy, or even create a lesson plan.", "Jamie": "Hmm, okay, I see. So, it's more about using images as prompts for creative text generation?"}, {"Alex": "Precisely! And to make it even tougher, each task has specific criteria for judging the AI's response. It\u2019s not just, 'Does this *look* creative?' but, 'Does it fit the context? Is it factually consistent with the image?'", "Jamie": "Factual consistency\u2026 interesting. So, if the AI writes a story about a photo of a cat, it can't suddenly claim the cat is a spaceship?"}, {"Alex": "Haha, exactly! It needs to stay grounded in the visual reality. And the researchers didn\u2019t just rely on simple yes/no answers. They used another AI, GPT-4, to judge the responses.", "Jamie": "Wait, so they got an AI to judge AI creativity? That\u2019s kinda meta, isn\u2019t it?"}, {"Alex": "Totally meta! But it's a common approach. It is called MLLM-as-a-judge, and it is a way to try and standardize the evaluation. They even gave GPT-4 detailed instructions and criteria for each task to make sure it was being fair.", "Jamie": "Okay, that makes a bit more sense. So, what did they find? Did the robots pass the creativity test?"}, {"Alex": "Well, the results were\u2026 mixed. It turns out, the open-source MLLMs are not nearly as creative as the proprietary models, like Gemini and GPT-4. There's a pretty significant gap in performance.", "Jamie": "So, the big guys are still ahead of the game, even when it comes to creativity. That's not entirely surprising, I guess."}, {"Alex": "Yeah, but here's a really interesting twist: they also found that visually fine-tuning an AI \u2013 that is, training it specifically to understand images \u2013 can actually *hurt* its base level creative abilities! ", "Jamie": "Wait, what? How does that even make sense?"}, {"Alex": "It's wild, right? The researchers think it might be because the AI is focusing so much on processing the visual information that it's losing some of its, umm, general creative spark.", "Jamie": "Hmm, so it's like over-specialization? Like a musician who only practices scales and forgets how to improvise?"}, {"Alex": "That\u2019s a great analogy! It seems there might be a trade-off between visual understanding and overall creative flexibility.", "Jamie": "Okay, so MLLMs have certain shortcomings in dealing with creative tasks in daily situations. But what are the tasks that can be done to solve it."}, {"Alex": "That is indeed a brilliant question. The researchers note in the paper that better evaluation of visual creative intelligence are needed to address the gap.", "Jamie": "Okay, so what are we going to do to address the lacking MLLMs now?"}, {"Alex": "That's what the next steps of MLLMs is heading towards to. More reseach and development into addressing this limitation should be conducted as suggested by the researchers.", "Jamie": "It makes sense because if AI-gen creativity does improve to the point where it becomes a tool to augment human output, well... it better not start hallucinating."}, {"Alex": "And that's why factuality matters! It's not just about being creative, it's about being *responsibly* creative.", "Jamie": "So, umm, where does this leave us? Are we doomed to a future of uninspired AI art?"}, {"Alex": "Not at all! This research isn't a doomsday prophecy, it's a roadmap. It pinpoints the areas where MLLMs need improvement and gives us a better way to measure progress.", "Jamie": "Okay, that's reassuring. So, what's the big takeaway here?"}, {"Alex": "The main takeaway is that assessing creative capabilities requires benchmarks that encompass a broader range of fundamental cognitive abilities. It will open opportunities for MLLMs in context-aware creativity and vision-based language generation.", "Jamie": "Hmm, that makes sense. "}, {"Alex": "The research shows that multimodal models will get even better at being able to help improve daily task. It will offer many opportunities for people who don't have access to art or language.", "Jamie": "And if it has better visual-understanding to better integrate with creative expression. It should be ethical as well and human aligned as well."}, {"Alex": "Ethical, human aligned and factual. These should all be taken into consideration for the future development.", "Jamie": "Awesome, that was very insightful. Thanks for unpacking that research, Alex."}, {"Alex": "No problem, Jamie! And thanks everyone for tuning in. It seems the robots still have a ways to go before they're winning art prizes, but this research is a crucial step in getting them there. Until next time!", "Jamie": "Thanks for the conversation. Goodbye!"}]
