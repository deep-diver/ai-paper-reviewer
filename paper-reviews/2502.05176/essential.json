This is a significant challenge for applications like virtual and augmented reality, where realistic scene manipulation is crucial.  These issues stem from the difficulties in accurately identifying and filling unseen regions in 3D scenes represented by multiple views.  Inconsistent depth estimation and difficulties in handling large viewpoint changes also hinder performance.\nThe paper introduces AuraFusion360, a novel reference-based method that leverages Gaussian Splatting for efficient 3D scene representation. Key innovations include depth-aware unseen mask generation for accurate occlusion identification, Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion (AGDD) for structured initial point placement, and SDEdit-based detail enhancement for multi-view coherence. The proposed method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both perceptual quality and geometric accuracy, even with dramatic viewpoint changes.  Furthermore, it introduces 360-USID, a new dataset for 360\u00b0 unbounded scene inpainting, providing a valuable benchmark for future research.", "affiliation": "National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2502.05176/podcast.wav"}
