The problem is that existing methods for creating datasets for training these models often result in low-quality data, which hinders performance. GATEAU addresses this by using two novel techniques: Homologous Models' Guidance (HMG) and Contextual Awareness Measurement (CAM). HMG uses the difference in perplexity scores between two similar models with different context window sizes to identify samples with complex long-range dependencies. CAM assesses whether the model's attention mechanism focuses on the important parts of the input text, also identifying challenging samples. By combining these two measures, GATEAU selects the most challenging samples, resulting in a higher-quality training dataset. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs trained on the dataset created using GATEAU achieve significantly better performance on various benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the method in improving both instruction-following and long-context understanding abilities."}
