Current methods often struggle because simply increasing data volume doesn't guarantee quality.  The authors propose GATEAU, a new framework that uses two key techniques: Homologous Models' Guidance (HMG) and Contextual Awareness Measurement (CAM). HMG assesses the difficulty of generating correct responses due to long-range dependencies using perplexity scores from two similar models with differing context window sizes. CAM measures how well a model focuses attention on relevant parts of the long input.  GATEAU uses these measures to select the most 'challenging' samples, which are then used to train the LLM.  Experiments show that LLMs trained with GATEAU's selected samples significantly outperform those trained on the full dataset, even when using only a small subset of the data. This suggests that careful sample selection is key to improving LLMs' ability to understand and respond to long and complex instructions."}
