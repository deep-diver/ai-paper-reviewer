This issue significantly undermines their reliability. Recent research points to knowledge inconsistency between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages as a major contributing factor.  When fine-tuning data requires knowledge not present in the pre-training data, the LLM may fabricate answers, leading to hallucinations. For instance, if an LLM is fine-tuned on a question answering task with an example about a person it hasn't encountered during pre-training, it might be incentivized to provide plausible but incorrect answers for similar questions about unknown individuals. This highlights the importance of disentangling knowledge acquisition (pre-training) and skill learning (fine-tuning) in LLM training.  Current methods intertwine these two stages, leaving the skill-learning phase vulnerable to interference from knowledge inconsistencies.  Effectively separating knowledge and skill acquisition is crucial to mitigate hallucinations and improve the overall factuality of LLM outputs.", "first_cons": "The introduction focuses heavily on the problem of hallucination in LLMs without offering immediate solutions.  It sets up the problem well, but leaves the reader wanting to know how the proposed solution will be approached.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly defines the core problem of LLM hallucination and provides a concise explanation of its root cause: knowledge inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning.

It identifies knowledge inconsistency between pre-training and fine-tuning as a primary cause.  Fine-tuning on data requiring knowledge absent from the pre-training phase can mislead the LLM into fabricating answers.

The authors differentiate their work by emphasizing the disentanglement of skills and knowledge during LLM fine-tuning, focusing on the grounding of LLM outputs, and utilizing synthetic data to achieve this. They contrast their method with prior work that focuses on improving consistency with evidence or improving decoding algorithms.  Specifically, they mention the work of Jones et al.

It achieves this through a two-stage process: 1) Prerequisite Learning, where a knowledge LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is trained to learn necessary knowledge from a prerequisite knowledge dataset (Dknow); and 2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where a skill LoRA is trained on the main task dataset (DT), with the knowledge LoRA frozen, focusing solely on skill acquisition.  The method also incorporates fictitious synthetic data to create multiple versions of knowledge LoRAs and enhances the grounding of LLM answers to their internal knowledge.  This multi-version approach forces the skill LoRA to learn to select appropriate knowledge for grounding responses, leading to better factual outputs and robustness against knowledge inconsistency.  The paper also discusses extending the method to include answer abstention by incorporating unfamiliar knowledge into the training data, allowing the model to confidently express 'I don't know' when uncertain.  This modular design using LoRAs allows for plug-and-play knowledge modules that control knowledge access and a skill module that functions with diverse knowledge sources, opening possibilities beyond hallucination reduction, such as novel RAG paradigms and privacy protection.", "first_cons": "The method relies heavily on the quality and construction of the prerequisite knowledge dataset (Dknow).
