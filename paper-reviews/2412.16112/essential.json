This significantly limits real-time applications and scalability. Existing efficient attention methods have limitations when applied to pre-trained models, hindering wider adoption.\n\nThe proposed CLEAR method uses a convolution-like local attention mechanism to linearize pre-trained diffusion transformers. This reduces computational complexity by 99.5% and boosts generation speed by 6.3 times for 8K images.  Remarkably, it achieves comparable performance to the original model while demonstrating excellent zero-shot generalization and multi-GPU parallel inference capabilities.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.16112/podcast.wav"}
