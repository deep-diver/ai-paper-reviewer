{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in large multimodal models (LMMs) and cross-cultural AI. It introduces the first large-scale Japanese benchmark, JMMMU, enabling more robust and culturally sensitive evaluations of LMMs.  The findings highlight the limitations of current English-centric evaluations and the need for culturally diverse benchmarks, opening new avenues for research in multilingual LMM development and bias mitigation.", "summary": "JMMMU, a new Japanese benchmark, provides a comprehensive culture-aware evaluation for Large Multimodal Models, revealing significant performance gaps and highlighting the need for culturally diverse AI benchmarks.", "takeaways": ["JMMMU, the first large-scale Japanese benchmark for evaluating LMMs on expert-level tasks, offers culture-agnostic and culture-specific subsets for comprehensive evaluation.", "Many LMMs show performance drops in Japanese compared to English, even on translated, culturally agnostic tasks, highlighting the need for more than just translation in multilingual AI development.", "Evaluation solely on culture-agnostic tasks misrepresents LMMs' true understanding of culture, making culture-specific datasets crucial for unbiased evaluations."], "tldr": "This research introduces JMMMU, a new benchmark for assessing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in Japanese.  It addresses the limitations of current English-centric benchmarks by including two key subsets: a culture-agnostic (CA) subset, directly comparable to existing English benchmarks, and a culture-specific (CS) subset designed to evaluate cultural understanding.  Evaluating 18 LMMs, the study reveals significant performance drops in Japanese even on the CA subset, highlighting the importance of language-specific development.  The CS subset further exposes shallow cultural understanding in many models. JMMMU allows for a direct comparison of performance between English and Japanese, revealing purely linguistic performance gaps and cultural understanding shortcomings. This comprehensive benchmark encourages more inclusive and culturally diverse LMM development and evaluation, offering a new standard for benchmarking multilingual AI capabilities."}
