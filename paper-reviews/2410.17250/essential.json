It highlights the key contributions, findings, and importance of the research for the AI community.", "summary": "JMMMU, a new benchmark, rigorously evaluates large multimodal models' Japanese language and cultural understanding, revealing significant performance gaps and highlighting the need for culturally diverse benchmarks.", "takeaways": ["JMMMU is the first large-scale Japanese benchmark designed for culture-aware evaluation of large multimodal models (LMMs).", "Evaluating LMMs using only translation-based benchmarks can lead to overestimation of their abilities, as shown by JMMMU's culture-specific subset.", "Japanese LMMs show strong performance on culture-specific tasks, but underperform in culture-agnostic tasks, suggesting a need for improvement in general reasoning capabilities."], "tldr": "The paper introduces JMMMU, a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate large multimodal models (LMMs) understanding of Japanese, including both language and cultural aspects.  It comprises two subsets: a culture-agnostic (CA) subset, directly comparable to the existing MMMU benchmark, and a culture-specific (CS) subset uniquely designed for Japanese cultural contexts.  Evaluating 18 LMMs, the study reveals significant performance drops in Japanese compared to English on the CA subset, even when the questions are identical. The CS subset further exposes inadequate cultural understanding in many models. Some models excel in the CA subset but fail in the CS subset indicating superficial understanding of Japanese. This highlights the insufficiency of relying solely on translation-based evaluation. JMMMU offers a much-needed tool for improving cultural awareness in LMMs and creating more inclusive and robust benchmarks for multilingual model development."}
