These methods struggled to achieve high accuracy and generalizability, particularly on complex Olympiad-level problems. AlphaGeometry, a neuro-symbolic system, showed promise but still had limitations in language coverage, symbolic engine efficiency, and overall solve rate. \nThis paper introduces AlphaGeometry2, a substantial upgrade that addresses these limitations.  **AlphaGeometry2 achieves a significant performance boost through several key improvements:** an expanded domain-specific language to tackle harder problems, a more efficient and robust symbolic engine (DDAR), a novel knowledge-sharing search algorithm (SKEST), and an enhanced language model built upon the Gemini architecture. These advancements enable AlphaGeometry2 to solve 84% of IMO geometry problems from 2000-2024 and surpasses the performance of human gold medalists.  The paper also demonstrates progress towards a fully automated system using natural language input.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.03544/podcast.wav"}
