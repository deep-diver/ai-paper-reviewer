The authors highlight the importance of chronological knowledge, particularly in fields where knowledge builds upon prior understanding (like science), and emphasize the need for models to accurately reflect this accumulative nature.  They introduce the concept of 'accumulated knowledge,' differentiating between knowledge that changes (e.g., scientific discoveries) and knowledge that remains static (e.g., mathematical facts).

The Sampling-based Knowledge Categorization (SliCK) framework, which is modified from Gekhman et al. (2024), categorizes LLM responses into three levels: Correct, Partial Correct, and Incorrect, based on how well the model's answers match the ground truth.  This modification incorporates a time attribute (t) to the standard subject-relation-object triplet, allowing for the evaluation of knowledge across different time stamps.  Further, to address the limitation of capturing the model's knowledge at only specific time points, which is a limitation of the previous work, this paper proposes using diverse templates, specifically triplets (Generation) and multiple-choice question answering (MCQA), to more effectively and comprehensively elicit a model's knowledge.  The rationale is that different templates might uncover different aspects of a model's understanding.", "first_cons": "The modified SliCK framework, while improved, still primarily focuses on evaluating knowledge at specific time points rather than assessing the continuous evolution of knowledge over time.
