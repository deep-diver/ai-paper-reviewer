Deformable Gaussian Splatting shows promise, but suffers from redundant Gaussians leading to slower speeds. Static areas don't need attribute updates leading to unnecessary processing overhead. The primary bottleneck in rendering speed is the number of Gaussians.\n\nThis paper introduces Efficient Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (**EDGS**) to represent dynamic scenes via **sparse time-variant attribute modeling**. It formulates dynamic scenes using a sparse anchor-grid with motion flow calculated via kernel representation. It efficiently filters out static area anchors, inputting only deformable object anchors into MLPs for time-variant attribute queries.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2502.20378/podcast.wav"}
