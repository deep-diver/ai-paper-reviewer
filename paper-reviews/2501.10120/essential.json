{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers seeking to improve academic literature searches.  **PaSa's autonomous approach to literature review**, using LLMs to refine queries, read papers, and navigate citations, is highly relevant to current research trends and offers a significant improvement over existing methods.  The study also provides valuable **datasets (AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery)** that can benefit the wider research community.  It paves the way for future work developing more sophisticated AI-powered research tools.", "summary": "PaSa: An LLM agent autonomously performs comprehensive academic paper searches, outperforming existing methods by efficiently combining search tools, paper reading, and citation analysis, optimized via reinforcement learning.", "takeaways": ["PaSa, a novel LLM-powered agent, autonomously performs comprehensive academic paper searches.", "PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines like Google Scholar, achieving substantial improvements in recall and precision.", "PaSa utilizes reinforcement learning with newly created high-quality datasets (AutoScholarQuery and RealScholarQuery) for effective training and evaluation."], "tldr": "Academic paper search is challenging due to long-tail queries and the need for comprehensive surveys. Existing tools often fall short, causing researchers to spend considerable time conducting literature reviews. This paper introduces PaSa, an AI-powered paper search agent that can autonomously manage multiple tasks such as invoking search tools, reading papers, and selecting relevant references. This is achieved by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and optimizing it with reinforcement learning. \nPaSa is trained using a new synthetic dataset, AutoScholarQuery, and then evaluated using a real-world benchmark dataset, RealScholarQuery.  The results show PaSa significantly outperforms existing baselines in terms of recall and precision, demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing complex scholarly queries.  The method includes a Crawler LLM agent that automatically invokes search tools and extracts citations, and a Selector LLM agent that carefully reads each paper to assess its relevance.  The study also provides both datasets and code for reproducibility, making it a valuable contribution to the field.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.10120/podcast.wav"}
