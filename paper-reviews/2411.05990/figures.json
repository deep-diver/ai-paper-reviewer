Part (a) shows the payoff matrix of the Prisoner's Dilemma, illustrating the strategic interaction between two players who must simultaneously choose to cooperate or defect.

This diagram breaks down the process into sequential steps: game introduction, thinking chain generation (where the model evaluates potential actions and opponent's responses), decision-making (choosing an action based on the expected payoffs), and finally checking for Nash Equilibrium. This workflow guides the LLM in strategic decision-making for simultaneous games by providing a structured approach to analyzing payoffs and predicting opponent behavior.", "section": "4.4 Workflow Design based on Classic Game Theory"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05990/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: An illustration of workflow design for sequential game.

The workflow aims to guide agents towards achieving a final allocation that is both envy-free (no agent prefers another's allocation) and Pareto-optimal (no alternative allocation improves any agent's utility without harming another).", "section": "5 Incomplete-information Game with Negotiation"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.05990/extracted/5988292/Fig/payoff_pd.jpeg", "caption": "Figure 5: Agents\u2019 performance under different payoff matrix for Prisoner\u2019s Dilemma", "description": "This figure displays the results of experiments conducted to evaluate the robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of the Prisoner's Dilemma game.  The experiments systematically varied the payoff matrix while maintaining the same Nash equilibrium, to assess whether the LLMs would consistently make rational decisions.

Each heatmap represents a specific payoff matrix variation, showing the probability distribution of the actions (Cooperate or Defect) chosen by the two agents.
