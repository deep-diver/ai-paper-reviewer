[{"heading_title": "HF Atlas: Overview", "details": {"summary": "The Hugging Face (HF) Atlas, as conceived in this research, represents a significant advancement in navigating and understanding the complex landscape of pre-trained models. **It aims to create a structured representation of the HF repository, capturing relationships between models based on their evolution, tasks, and performance.** This is crucial because the sheer volume of models (millions) makes manual discovery and analysis impractical. **The atlas uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to visualize model lineages, where nodes represent models and edges indicate transformations like fine-tuning or quantization.** The research highlights the limitations of relying solely on model documentation (Model Cards), which is often incomplete. **The atlas, therefore, acts as a knowledge graph, providing insights into model trends, accuracy prediction, and heritage recovery.** Visualizations of the atlas reveal interesting patterns, such as the differing adoption of techniques (quantization, adapters) across modalities (vision vs. language). **The atlas facilitates a deeper understanding of model relationships and dependencies.**"}}, {"heading_title": "Charting HF: Method", "details": {"summary": "Charting a model repository like Hugging Face (HF) requires a robust methodology to map the complex relationships between models. The method should address challenges like incomplete documentation, model duplication, and diverse transformation techniques (fine-tuning, quantization, merging). **Handling duplicates** and near-duplicates, which can skew distance-based approaches, is also crucial. The method also needs to take account of **temporal dependencies**, where the creation timestamp is a crucial piece of information, parent models typically have earlier upload times than their children; thus incorporating temporal dynamics becomes essential for accurately inferring model lineage. A sophisticated method will **classify patterns, such as \u201cfan\u201d or \u201csnake\u201d**, from weight distance, identifying hyper parameter sweeps (fan) and checkpoint trajectories (snake). This involves efficient distance metric calculation between model weights and handling merges, which create non-tree DAG structures. Efficient charting also needs to handle situations where model weights variance is low. A good method should classify structure to distinguish between model types."}}, {"heading_title": "ML Trend Analysis", "details": {"summary": "**Model repository atlases** offer a structured view of ML evolution, showing relationships, tasks, and performance. **Hugging Face (HF)**, the largest public model repository, shows complex model landscape with intriguing structures. Visualizations expose trends in **computer vision (CV)** and **natural language processing (NLP)**. **NLP models** exhibit greater DAG depth, suggesting iterative refinement, while **CV models** often directly link to foundation models. **Quantization** is common in **LLMs**, but emerging in vision (e.g., Flux). **Fine-tuning** dominates discriminative vision models; generative models increasingly adopt adapters. Merging is more prevalent in **NLP** than **CV**. These atlases offer valuable insights for analyzing model impact, tracing lineage, and charting undocumented areas of the model landscape. The research also suggests that the atlas structure can predict model attributes, improve model impact measurement, and helps in restoring removed models."}}, {"heading_title": "Accuracy Prediction", "details": {"summary": "The section on accuracy prediction highlights a crucial aspect of model repositories: **the often-missing or incomplete accuracy metrics**. Given that users prioritize accurate models, this is a significant limitation. The paper's approach leverages the **model DAG structure to predict accuracy**, using nearest neighbors in the atlas. This is insightful, as it suggests that models derived from similar origins or with similar transformations tend to exhibit comparable performance. The use of average nearest neighbor accuracy improves over simply relying on the majority label. This reveals a potential for **'transfer learning' of accuracy metrics**, where knowledge about one model's performance can inform expectations about related models, even when direct evaluation data is scarce. **Effectively imputing such metrics** could greatly enhance model discoverability and selection within large repositories."}}, {"heading_title": "IP Tracking Atlas", "details": {"summary": "**Intellectual Property (IP) tracking** is critical in AI. An atlas helps determine **model usage** and data dependencies, crucial for **rights management**. If a model has a specific license or uses particular data, all descendants are affected. Completing the atlas improves IP integrity and prevents unauthorized use, ensuring compliance and proper attribution. This aids in preventing copyright infringements and ensuring fairness in model deployment and usage."}}]
