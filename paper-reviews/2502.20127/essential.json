It enhances LLMs' capabilities through subtask-oriented, reinforced fine-tuning, improving generalization and opening new research avenues in automated software development.", "summary": "SoRFT enhances LLMs for issue resolving via subtask-oriented reinforced fine-tuning, outperforming other open-source models.", "takeaways": ["SoRFT enhances LLMs' issue-resolving capabilities through subtask decomposition and reinforced learning.", "The SoRFT-trained models achieve SOTA performance on SWE-Bench Verified and SWE-Bench Lite among open-source models.", "The subtask-oriented approach and rule-based reinforcement learning effectively improve model generalization and reduce reliance on costly commercial models."], "tldr": "Issue-resolving frameworks often rely on costly commercial models and struggle with generalization, failing to fully utilize open-source resources. **Existing training methods fall short of leveraging the wealth of information available in open-source development.** Addressing these challenges is crucial for creating more accessible and robust automated software development tools.\n\nThis paper introduces Subtask-oriented Reinforced Fine-Tuning (SoRFT). It decomposes issue resolving into structured subtasks: file localization, function localization, line localization, and code edit generation. **SoRFT utilizes rejection-sampled supervised fine-tuning and rule-based reinforcement learning to enhance LLMs' issue-resolving capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.**", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Software Development"}, "podcast_path": "2502.20127/podcast.wav"}
