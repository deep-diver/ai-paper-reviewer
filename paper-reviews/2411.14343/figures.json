It starts with collecting data using UnifiedCrawl, which filters and extracts relevant data from the Common Crawl corpus. Then, a pre-trained multilingual language model is fine-tuned using an efficient adapter method (QLORA) on the data generated from UnifiedCrawl.  Finally, this fine-tuned model is used for downstream tasks such as few-shot prompting.", "section": "1.2 Proposed Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14343/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Our Dataset is much Larger than all Prior Works", "description": "This figure compares the sizes of the dataset created by the authors (UnifiedCrawl) and other existing datasets for various low-resource languages. The bar chart visually represents the size of each dataset in megabytes. It highlights the significant advantage of UnifiedCrawl, which is substantially larger than datasets such as Wikipedia, CC-100, OSCAR, and mC4 for the selected languages (Pashto, Sindhi, Amharic, Hausa, Sundanese, Zulu, Yoruba). This demonstrates the substantial increase in training data available for low-resource languages, which is a crucial aspect of the paper.", "section": "2 Related Works"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14343/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 3: UnifiedCrawl: Data Extraction Framework", "description": "This figure illustrates the data extraction framework of UnifiedCrawl. It starts by filtering the Common Crawl index using DuckDB for a specific low-resource language. It then extracts relevant WARC files using HTTP Range Requests to reduce storage and download time.  The HTML contents are extracted using the WARCIO and Trafilatura libraries. Finally, a substring deduplication step removes redundancy. The resulting deduplicated text forms the UnifiedCrawl dataset.", "section": "3.1 Data Collection Framework"}]
