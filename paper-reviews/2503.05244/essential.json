Current benchmarks focus on generic tasks and miss the details needed for high-quality writing in different areas. To fix this, the paper creates a comprehensive benchmark to assess LLMs across creative, persuasive, informative, and technical writing.\n\nThe paper introduces a query-dependent evaluation, where LLMs create criteria for each instance. A tuned critic model scores based on these criteria, evaluating style, format, and length. They show this framework is valid, enabling 7B models to approach SOTA performance. Releasing the benchmark and tools helps advance LLMs in writing.", "affiliation": "Alibaba Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.05244/podcast.wav"}
