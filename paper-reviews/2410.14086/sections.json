It proposes that the next-token prediction loss used in training ICL models is fundamentally a data compression technique called prequential coding.  Minimizing this loss, the authors argue, implicitly minimizes both training error and model complexity, thus directly addressing Occam's razor. The section meticulously defines Kolmogorov complexity, a measure of a model's inherent simplicity, and shows how prequential coding links it to the next-token prediction loss, ultimately framing ICL as a meta-learning algorithm that implicitly optimizes model simplicity alongside prediction accuracy.  The section concludes by outlining a meta-learning problem to minimize the prequential code length (a proxy for joint model complexity and error) and argues that standard ICL methods provide an efficient solution to this problem.", "first_cons": "The section heavily relies on the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, which is computationally intractable.

Three types of datasets were used: linear regression, sinusoidal regression, and Mastermind (a multi-label classification problem).  The core comparison is between ICL using the standard next-token prediction objective (prequential ICL) versus an alternative train-risk ICL (which minimizes training error but not model complexity), and against a standard gradient-based learner (SGD).  The results show that prequential ICL consistently outperforms train-risk ICL in low-data regimes, achieving lower generalization error, demonstrating the importance of minimizing model complexity alongside training error.  Further experiments investigate the influence of meta-learner architectures on ICL's performance.  They also test large pretrained LLMs (GPT-4) to analyze their ICL capabilities. Finally, experiments investigate manipulating the data distribution (specifically, biasing towards shorter sequences) to potentially improve ICL\u2019s ability to minimize prequential code length.
