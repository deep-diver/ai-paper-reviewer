First, the weights are pre-quantized using a traditional method and its sensitivity metric. Second, the optimal outlier ratio for each layer is determined using Algorithm 1. Third, outliers are selected based on this ratio. Fourth, the weights are re-quantized after removing the outliers. Fifth, significant weights are recovered using Algorithm 2. Finally, the low-precision dense weights, sparse outliers and significant weights are summed to form the final quantized weight.", "section": "6. ReQuant: A Sensitivity-aware Quantization Pipeline"}]
