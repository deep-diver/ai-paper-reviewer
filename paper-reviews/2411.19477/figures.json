The algorithm first generates multiple candidate solutions (N) and then uses a knockout tournament approach to select the best one. In each round of the tournament, pairs of solutions are compared K times, and only the winners proceed. The x-axis represents the number of initial candidate solutions (N), while the y-axis represents the accuracy of the algorithm. Separate lines show the results for different comparison counts (K). The chart demonstrates how accuracy increases with both N and K, illustrating the algorithm's scalability and improved performance with increased computational resources.", "section": "Experiments"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.19477/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 2: A visualization of the proposed two-stage algorithm (with N=8\ud835\udc418N=8italic_N = 8 in this example).", "description": "This figure illustrates the two-stage process of the proposed algorithm.  The first stage shows the generation of N (in this example, 8) candidate solutions to a given problem. The second stage depicts a knockout tournament. Pairs of candidate solutions are compared K times, with the winners advancing to the next round.  This continues until a single winning solution remains, which is the algorithm's final output.  The figure visually represents the hierarchical structure of the comparison process, highlighting the iterative elimination of solutions.", "section": "A two-stage algorithm"}]
