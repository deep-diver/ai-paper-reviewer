Recent 3D models like **DUSt3R** changed things from multi-step to single-step processing. Still, multi-view datasets are scarce, leading to an open problem: **wide-baseline sparse-view SfM**. New models offer solutions. To that end, This paper uses DUSt3R for multi-view room layout, a natural solution. \n\nThis paper introduces **Plane-DUSt3R**, a new method leveraging DUSt3R for multi-view room layout. It fine-tunes DUSt3R on **Structure3D** to estimate structural planes, generating uniform results with one post-processing step and 2D detections. Unlike single-view methods, Plane-DUSt3R handles multiple views, streamlining the process and reducing errors. It improves on synthetic datasets and proves robust in-the-wild with different image styles.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Center for Construction Robotics, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Scene Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.16779/podcast.wav"}
