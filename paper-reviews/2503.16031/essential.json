Current methods struggle to differentiate harmless comedy from harmful misinformation. Addressing this challenge, this paper introduces the Deceptive Humor Dataset (DHD), a novel resource designed for studying humor derived from fabricated claims and misinformation. This new dataset is crucial for analyzing how humor intertwines with deception and for helping develop better methods to distinguish harmless comedy from harmful misinformation. \n\nDHD comprises humor-infused comments generated using the ChatGPT-4o model from false narratives and manipulated information.  Each instance is meticulously labeled with a Satire Level and classified into five distinct Humor Categories: Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, and Absurdity. Spanning multiple languages, including English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed variations, DHD serves as a valuable multilingual benchmark.  The paper establishes strong baselines for the proposed dataset, setting a strong foundation for future exploration and for advancing deceptive humor detection models.", "affiliation": "IIIT Dharwad", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16031/podcast.wav"}
