This approach can be computationally expensive and lacks flexibility.  Also, Classifier-free guidance, while enhancing quality, is difficult to integrate in these models.  These limitations hinder progress towards efficient and flexible cross-modal media generation.\nCrossFlow overcomes these challenges by directly learning a mapping between modalities using flow matching. This eliminates the need for both noise and conditioning mechanisms.  The authors introduce a method for enabling Classifier-free guidance which significantly improves the quality of generated images.  Moreover, CrossFlow demonstrates excellent scalability and allows for interesting latent arithmetic, making it a powerful new tool for cross-modal and intra-modal media generation.", "affiliation": "Meta GenAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.15213/podcast.wav"}
