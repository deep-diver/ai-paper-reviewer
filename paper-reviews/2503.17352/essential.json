This paper explores whether such reasoning capabilities can be integrated into Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to enhance their multimodal reasoning on challenging tasks. The method uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on training data and RL to generalize.\n\nThe authors introduce **OpenVLThinker**, an LVLM, that iteratively leverages SFT and RL for self-improvement. They distill reasoning from text-based models by generating reasoning steps from high-quality image captions. Iterative RL training enhances reasoning skills. This approach improves performance on benchmarks like MathVista, demonstrating its potential for robust vision-language reasoning.", "affiliation": "University of California, Los Angeles", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17352/podcast.wav"}
