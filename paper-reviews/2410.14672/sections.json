Reconstruction-based learning can produce visually appealing images but lacks strong feature representations suitable for downstream tasks like perception. This is particularly true for conditional image generation, where the added conditions guide the generation but are absent from downstream discriminative tasks, thus weakening the relationship between image features and their categories.  The authors highlight this limitation with an existing class-conditional image generation model, emphasizing the need for improvement. They introduce BiGR, a novel conditional image generation model that directly addresses this issue by using compact binary latent codes for both generative and discriminative tasks. BiGR is trained solely through a generative process, focusing on reconstructing tokens without any explicit discriminative losses. The model achieves this by compressing images into binary codes and predicting these codes during training. This unified framework aims to improve both image generation quality and visual representation capabilities. BiGR is the first conditional generative model to unify generative and discriminative tasks.

It first discusses binary latent codes, highlighting their compactness and discreteness as advantageous properties for visual representation, citing studies that have explored these codes in visual generation tasks, such as lookup-free quantization and binary autoencoders. The review then shifts to generative representation learning, noting the dominance of self-supervised methods in recent years and mentioning several prominent techniques like iGPT, MAE, and MAGE, which leverage generative modeling to learn visual representations.  However, the author points out the limitations of these existing approaches, particularly their lack of focus on representation capabilities within the context of *conditional* image generation, where discriminative tasks often lack the guidance present during the generative process.  Finally, the section summarizes existing approaches to conditional image generation, including diffusion and autoregressive models, and notes a relative scarcity of research into their representation capabilities.

The model is trained by masking a portion of the input tokens (following a cosine schedule, reaching up to 80% masked tokens) and learning to predict them using a Bernoulli diffusion process.  A key innovation is the use of a novel entropy-ordered sampling method for efficient image generation during inference. This method prioritizes unmasking tokens with the highest confidence scores, determined by the entropy magnitude of their predicted Bernoulli distribution probabilities.  For discriminative tasks, average pooling is performed on the intermediate features from the transformer blocks to obtain image representations.  A binary transcoder, using a Bernoulli diffusion process and weighted binary cross-entropy loss, transforms the model's outputs (continuous features) into predicted binary codes. The binary tokenizer, leveraging lookup-free quantization, translates the pixel-level image into a sequence of binary latent codes.  The decoder-only transformer with full bidirectional attention acts as the core of the model, processing both the binary latent codes and the conditional information.", "first_cons": "The reliance on a Bernoulli diffusion process introduces a degree of stochasticity in both the generation and discrimination processes, potentially leading to inconsistent results.
