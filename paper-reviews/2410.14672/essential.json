Unlike other models that focus on either generation or representation, BiGR does both simultaneously. It uses compact binary codes to represent images, making it efficient and versatile.  The model is trained using a masked modeling approach, where parts of the image's code are hidden and the model must predict them. This approach helps improve the image's overall representation.  Experiments showed that BiGR outperformed existing methods in both generating images and creating good representations, measured by FID-50k and linear-probe accuracy. BiGR also excels at zero-shot generalization, meaning it can be used for various tasks (like image inpainting or editing) without any additional training.  The use of binary codes also increases efficiency, generating images much faster than similar models."}
