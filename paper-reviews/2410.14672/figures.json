For simplicity, we display only 1 bit for each token, although each token actually consists of K bits in length. Left: We outline the training of BiGR. Starting with binary codes from binary tokenizers, we append a condition token and mask partial tokens. These tokens are projected into continuous embeddings and processed by the Llama backbone. The outputs undergo a Bernoulli denoising process in the binary transcoder to generate probabilities, penalized by the weighted binary cross-entropy loss (wBCE) at masked positions. Right: We illustrate the generation process (detailed in Sec. 3.3) and the representation acquisition via average pooling.", "description": "Figure 2 illustrates the training and generation processes of the BiGR model, highlighting the use of binary latent codes, masked modeling, and a Bernoulli diffusion process for both tasks.", "section": "3 METHOD"}, {"figure_path": "2410.14672/figures/figures_9_0.png", "caption": "Figure 1: BiGR generates high-quality images while improving the discriminative capabilities of the representations.
