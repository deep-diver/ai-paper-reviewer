For simplicity, we display only 1 bit for each token, although each token actually consists of K bits in length. Left: We outline the training of BiGR. Starting with binary codes from binary tokenizers, we append a condition token and mask partial tokens. These tokens are projected into continuous embeddings and processed by the Llama backbone. The outputs undergo a Bernoulli denoising process in the binary transcoder to generate probabilities, penalized by the weighted binary cross-entropy loss (wBCE) at masked positions.
