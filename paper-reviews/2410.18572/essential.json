This paper introduces Taipan, a hybrid model designed to address this challenge. Taipan combines the memory efficiency of a state-space model called Mamba-2 with a mechanism called 'selective attention'.  This selective attention focuses computational resources only on the most important parts of the input text, allowing for processing of much longer sequences than is typically possible.  The researchers tested Taipan on several tasks and found that it significantly outperformed existing models, particularly on tasks requiring the model to 'remember' information from earlier parts of a long sequence.  Taipan demonstrates that effective long-context processing is achievable with a more efficient approach than traditional methods, opening doors for developing even more powerful and efficient LLMs in the future."}
