State Space Models (SSMs) offer constant memory usage but often underperform in tasks requiring extensive context retrieval. This paper introduces Taipan, a hybrid model that combines the efficiency of Mamba-2 (an SSM) with selective attention layers (SALs).  SALs identify crucial tokens needing long-range interactions, refine their features, and augment their representations via attention. This balances Mamba's efficiency with Transformer-like performance.  Taipan achieves accurate predictions with context lengths up to 1 million tokens, while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments show Taipan outperforms other models across various scales and tasks, offering a promising solution for efficient long-context language modeling."}
