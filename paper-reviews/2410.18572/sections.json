Causal Self-Attention, the core of Transformer models, allows each token to attend to all previous tokens, resulting in quadratic computational complexity. Linear Attention addresses this by replacing softmax attention with dot-product attention, achieving linear complexity but sacrificing some accuracy in capturing intricate relationships between tokens.  Mamba-2, a variant of structured state-space models (SSMs), uses a selective data-dependent mechanism and offers constant memory usage during inference, making it efficient for long sequences. However, like Linear Attention, it relies on Markov assumptions, potentially leading to information loss for tokens requiring long-range interactions.

Less critical tokens bypass this attention step, balancing efficiency with performance. This approach enables Taipan to handle up to 1 million tokens while maintaining computational efficiency. The architecture includes a gating network to determine which tokens need attention and utilizes the Gumbel-Softmax trick to ensure differentiability during training. A sliding window attention mechanism helps maintain linear time complexity.
