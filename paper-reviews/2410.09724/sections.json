It highlights the increasing importance of reliability in LLMs, particularly as their applications expand into complex problem-solving and scientific discovery. The authors emphasize the two main methods of assessing LLM confidence: logit-based approaches (derived from output token probability distributions) and verbalized expressions (where the model explicitly states its confidence).  The introduction focuses primarily on verbalized confidence, setting the stage for the research presented in the paper.  Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is introduced as a significant method for improving LLM performance, but the authors note that previous studies have indicated that RLHF can exacerbate overconfidence in LLMs, an issue that this study aims to address.  The introduction concludes by stating that this research focuses on the verbalized confidence aspect of LLM calibration and aims to address the overconfidence phenomena introduced by RLHF.", "first_cons": "The introduction does not elaborate on the specific techniques used in previous attempts to address LLM overconfidence.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly and concisely explains the importance of LLM calibration and its relevance to the broader field of AI.", "keypoints": ["The growing importance of LLM reliability as applications expand.", "Two primary methods for assessing LLM confidence: logit-based and verbalized.", "Focus on verbalized confidence in this paper.", "RLHF's role in improving LLM performance and its potential to increase overconfidence.", "The overconfidence phenomenon in LLMs trained with RLHF is a key problem this study addresses."], "second_cons": "It lacks specific details on the types of LLMs that will be studied and the specific datasets used in the experiments.", "second_pros": "The introduction effectively sets the context for the research and clearly states the research questions.", "summary": "This paper's introduction highlights the critical need for calibrated Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the context of their expanding applications.

The authors demonstrate that RLHF-LLMs tend to express more overconfidence in their verbalized confidence scores compared to their pre-RLHF counterparts. This overconfidence is attributed to a systematic bias in reward models, which favor responses with high confidence scores regardless of their actual quality.  Experiments reveal that reward models, when presented with incorrect answers, assign higher rewards to those with high confidence scores than those with low confidence scores (e.g., the vanilla model shows a bias toward high confidence, even when the answer is wrong, assigning -7.31 for an incorrect answer with high confidence versus -7.34 for an incorrect answer with low confidence).  This bias is observed across multiple reward models and datasets. The researchers highlight that this bias doesn't stem from sharpened output distributions, as previously suggested, but rather from the reward model's preference for high-confidence scores. This finding motivates the development of novel calibration methods in the next section.  The analysis uses the CommonsenseQA dataset and evaluates two reward models: ArmoRM-Llama3-8B-v0.1 and allenai/tulu-2-dpo-7b. The experiment shows a clear preference towards responses with high confidence scores from the reward models, regardless of the accuracy of the response.", "first_cons": "The study focuses primarily on verbalized confidence, neglecting logit-based approaches to assessing model confidence.

Both methods are designed to be seamlessly integrated into the existing PPO pipeline and do not require additional golden labels. The effectiveness of these methods is demonstrated through experiments on Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B across multiple datasets, showing improved calibration without sacrificing performance or compromising model capabilities in open-ended conversation settings.

Two model families, Llama3-8B and Mistral-7B, were used, along with six diverse datasets encompassing various reasoning tasks.  Both methods aim to address the bias in reward models towards high-confidence responses, irrespective of accuracy. PPO-M calibrates the reward model by incorporating confidence scores into its training, while PPO-C adjusts reward scores during training based on the discrepancy between current rewards and a moving average. Experiments involved two prompting strategies: Direct Answers and Zero-Shot Chain-of-Thought, and two evaluation metrics: Expected Calibration Error (ECE) and Area Under the Curve (AUC).  The results consistently show that both PPO-M and PPO-C outperform vanilla PPO, achieving lower ECE and comparable or higher accuracy across multiple datasets and prompting strategies.  For instance, on the GSM8K dataset using Llama3-8B and the Direct Answer prompting strategy, PPO-M reduces ECE by 6.44 points and increases accuracy by 2.73 points compared to vanilla PPO.
