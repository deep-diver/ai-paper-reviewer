Inspired by the brain's memory mechanisms, this paper introduces a new architecture to overcome these limitations. By leveraging biological insights, the paper addresses the challenge of balancing explicit token representations and extreme compression. \n\nThe paper presents **Mixture-of-Memories (MoM)**, which employs multiple independent memory states with a routing network, directing input tokens to specific states. This enhances memory capacity and reduces interference. MoM retains linear complexity during training and constant complexity during inference. Experiments show MoM outperforms current models on downstream tasks, even matching Transformer performance.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.13685/podcast.wav"}
