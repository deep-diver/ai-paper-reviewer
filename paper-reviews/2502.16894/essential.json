Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers a parameter-efficient alternative but often falls short of full fine-tuning performance. Existing methods use static SVD subsets for initialization, leading to suboptimal use of pre-trained knowledge. Incorporating Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures improves LoRA, weight misalignment and gradient dynamics pose challenges, hindering SVD prior use. Addressing this is crucial for better efficiency and performance. \n\nThis paper introduces Great LoRA Mixture-of-Expert (GOAT), a framework that adaptively integrates relevant priors using an SVD-structured MoE, aligning optimization with full fine-tuned MoE via a theoretical scaling factor. GOAT initializes LoRA MOE experts with distinct SVD knowledge segments. The method aligns weight & gradient, ensuring the equivalent weight equals to the pre-trained weight. Experiments across 25 datasets show state-of-the-art performance, closing the gap with Full FT without modifying architecture or training algorithms.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.16894/podcast.wav"}
