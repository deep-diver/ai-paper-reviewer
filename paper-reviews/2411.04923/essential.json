This is largely due to the complex spatial and temporal dynamics inherent in videos.  They typically handle basic conversations but fail to pinpoint objects and regions in the video precisely.  This lack of fine-grained understanding restricts their practical applications in advanced video analysis tasks.\n\nTo overcome this, the authors introduce VideoGLaMM, a novel LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding. **VideoGLaMM uses a unique architecture comprising three key components:** a Large Language Model (LLM), a dual vision encoder capturing spatial and temporal details, and a spatio-temporal decoder for generating precise object masks. These components are interconnected via adapters which ensure close Vision-Language alignment. **VideoGLaMM is trained on a meticulously curated multimodal dataset** featuring detailed, visually grounded conversations. Evaluation across three challenging tasks shows **VideoGLaMM outperforming existing approaches**, demonstrating its efficacy in grounded conversation generation, visual grounding, and referring video segmentation.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}}
