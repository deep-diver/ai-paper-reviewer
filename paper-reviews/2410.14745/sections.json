It uses a bi-level approach incorporating knowledge propagation and selection. Knowledge propagation is achieved through both in-weight (adapting the model using labeled data) and in-context methods (using k-nearest neighbor retrieval in latent space). Collaborative learning, using multiple LLMs with different configurations for inference and self-justification, is used to improve the accuracy of pseudo-responses. Adaptive selection of high-quality pseudo-responses is performed using response entropy.  The process starts with initial warm-up on labeled data, followed by knowledge propagation, collaborative learning to generate pseudo-responses, and adaptive selection to filter these responses for superior quality.  Finally, the model is further fine-tuned using the refined dataset. This approach combines labeled and unlabeled data to maximize the benefits for fine-tuning LLMs, especially in situations with limited labeled data.  The methods are implemented using a combination of techniques including k-nearest neighbor search (k=3), and percentile calculation (percentile=50%) for entropy-based selection.", "first_cons": "The methodology relies on multiple LLMs, increasing computational cost and complexity.
