It addresses the common challenge of limited labeled data in real-world applications. SEMIEVOL employs a two-stage process: 1) Knowledge propagation, where it transfers knowledge from labeled to unlabeled data using both 'in-weight' (adjusting model parameters) and 'in-context' (using labeled examples as context during prediction) methods. 2) Knowledge selection, where it uses a collaborative learning mechanism to select higher-quality pseudo-responses from unlabeled data. Experiments on several datasets show that SEMIEVOL significantly improves LLM performance compared to using only labeled data (supervised fine-tuning) or only unlabeled data (self-evolution methods).  The results highlight SEMIEVOL's efficiency and effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data and abundant unlabeled data."}
