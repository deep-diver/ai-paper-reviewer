The core idea is to propagate knowledge from labeled to unlabeled data using a bi-level approach, involving both in-weight (adjusting model parameters) and in-context (using labeled data as context during inference) methods.  To improve the selection of unlabeled data samples, SEMIEVOL incorporates a collaborative learning approach, where multiple LLMs work together to generate pseudo-responses and self-justify them, leading to more confident and reliable data.  The unlabeled data are then adaptively selected using response entropy as a measure of confidence. Experiments on seven datasets, using GPT-40-mini and Llama-3.1, showed that SEMIEVOL significantly outperformed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and self-evolution methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the method in utilizing hybrid data scenarios.  The findings suggest that SEMIEVOL is a practical and valuable tool for researchers looking to adapt LLMs data-efficiently."}
