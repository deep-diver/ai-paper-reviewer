Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies heavily on labeled data, which can be expensive and limited. SEMIEVOL tackles this by effectively utilizing both limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data.  It does this through a two-stage process: knowledge propagation and selection.  Knowledge propagation uses a bi-level approach: in-weight propagation (adapting the model using labeled data) and in-context propagation (using k-nearest neighbor retrieval in a latent space to aid predictions).  Knowledge selection uses a collaborative learning framework where multiple LLMs self-justify their responses, improving accuracy. It also incorporates an adaptive selection process that filters out low-confidence pseudo-responses, further enhancing the quality of the training data.  Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SEMIEVOL significantly improves LLM performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and other semi-supervised methods, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. The method exhibits consistent improvements across general and domain-specific tasks.  The iterative application of SEMIEVOL demonstrates continuous evolution capabilities, further improving performance as more unlabeled data becomes available."}
