The evaluation metrics used are Text Alignment (TA) and Editing Consistency (EC), following the approach of Custom Diffusion [31]. Higher scores indicate better performance. The methods compared include Adobe Firefly, Anydoor, Paint-by-Example, MasaCtrl, StyleAligned, Cross-Image Attention, and the authors' proposed method. The results provide a numerical assessment of each method's ability to generate consistent and textually aligned edits.", "section": "4. Experiments"}]
