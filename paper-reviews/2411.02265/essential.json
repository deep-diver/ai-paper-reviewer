Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer an alternative, distributing computation across specialized submodels, but often lack scale and robust training methods. This research addresses these issues by introducing Hunyuan-Large.\nHunyuan-Large is a massive open-source MoE model exceeding other open-source LLMs in size and performance across various benchmarks.  Its success is attributed to several key innovations, including extensive synthetic training data, a mixed-expert routing strategy, and techniques to improve efficiency.  The paper also investigates the scaling laws of MoE models, providing valuable guidance for future model development and optimization.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
