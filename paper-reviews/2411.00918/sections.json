Results reveal that despite unique characteristics, algorithms exhibit **similar average performance** across various tasks.  The study highlights the importance of **early stopping mechanisms** for improved results and identifies promising research directions by exploring expert assignment, selection, and the impact of various vision encoders. **LibMoE\u2019s modular design** allows researchers to easily customize algorithms and facilitates deeper investigation into various factors beyond final performance metrics."}}, {"heading_title": "Expert Selection", "details": {"summary": "The research explores expert selection within Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, examining its dynamics across various algorithms and datasets.  **Early training stages show significant fluctuations in expert allocation**, gradually stabilizing as more data is processed.  **The Perturbed Cosine Router demonstrates faster convergence**, achieving stable expert assignments earlier than others. Interestingly, the final training checkpoints don't always yield the best performance, suggesting the potential benefits of early stopping. Analyzing expert selection across different subtasks reveals **varied specialization patterns**: simpler tasks show higher confidence in expert selection (lower entropy), while complex tasks exhibit broader distributions (higher entropy).  **The Cosine Router and Perturbed Cosine Router maintain consistent, low entropy values across subtasks**, indicating strong specialization.  Conversely, the SMOE and Hyper Routers display more variability, potentially impacting overall performance due to over-reliance on specific experts.  The study underscores the importance of understanding expert selection mechanisms to enhance MoE model effectiveness.  Furthermore, **architecture choices, specifically the vision encoder, also influence expert selection patterns**, highlighting the need to consider diverse factors for optimal performance."}}, {"heading_title": "Future Directions", "details": {"summary": "The provided text does not contain a section or heading specifically titled 'Future Directions'.
