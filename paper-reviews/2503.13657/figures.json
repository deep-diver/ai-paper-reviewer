The taxonomy categorizes failures into three main areas: specification and system design, inter-agent misalignment, and task verification and termination.  Within each area, several specific failure modes are identified, along with the percentage of times they appeared in the analysis of 151 MAS traces.

The process begins with collecting data from various Multi-Agent Systems (MAS). Then, failure modes are identified within these MAS datasets.  Next, an iterative refinement process is conducted through inter-annotator agreement studies to enhance the consistency and precision of the taxonomy.  This iterative process aims at achieving a high level of agreement among multiple annotators, as measured by Cohen's Kappa score (0.88 in this case). Finally, a refined taxonomy of MAS failure modes is produced.", "section": "3.

The Phone Agent does not correctly convey the API requirements for login, specifically regarding the proper username format (phone number instead of email address). Simultaneously, the Supervisor Agent neglects to clarify any ambiguities or seek further clarification from the Phone Agent. This lack of collaborative effort results in repeated, unproductive attempts to log in and eventually leads to the task's failure, marked by the Supervisor Agent.
