Traditional methods for text segmentation (rule-based or semantic similarity) often overlook the crucial aspect of logical connections between sentences. Meta-Chunking addresses this by identifying groups of sentences within paragraphs that exhibit strong logical relationships, a granularity between sentences and paragraphs. The researchers propose two main strategies: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking, which both use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform binary classification or analyze perplexity distributions to identify chunk boundaries. To adapt to different text complexities, a dynamic merging strategy is proposed to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained chunking. Experiments across eleven datasets show that Meta-Chunking significantly improves the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering within RAG. For instance, on one benchmark, it outperformed similarity-based chunking by a significant margin while requiring only 45.8% of the processing time."}
