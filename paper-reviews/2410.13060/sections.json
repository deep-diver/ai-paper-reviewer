The widespread use of proprietary LLMs like ChatGPT has heightened privacy concerns, leading to a demand for PI where inference is performed directly on encrypted inputs without revealing sensitive data. Current PI methods, however, suffer from extremely high communication and latency overheads, primarily due to the presence of non-linear operations within the LLM architecture.  These overheads are substantial; for example, processing a single token with a 125M parameter GPT-2 model can take 8.2 minutes and require 25.3 GB of communication, increasing to 30.7 minutes and 145.2 GB for a 512-token context.  Existing PI solutions often either ignore the computational cost of LayerNorm or resort to approximations of non-linear activation functions like GELU, which are known to be highly sensitive to initial guesses and limited in accuracy and input range.  The introduction highlights the need for a new approach that systematically addresses the role of non-linearities in LLMs to enable practical and efficient PI.", "first_cons": "Current PI methods are impractical due to their high latency and communication overheads, making them unsuitable for real-world applications.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly defines the problem of inefficient private inference for LLMs and highlights the significant performance limitations of current approaches.", "keypoints": ["High communication and latency overheads in current PI methods (e.g., 8.2 minutes and 25.3 GB for a single token with GPT-2).", "The prohibitive cost stems largely from non-linear operations (GELU, LayerNorm).", "Existing solutions often neglect LayerNorm costs or use inaccurate polynomial approximations of non-linear functions.", "The need for a new architectural approach to efficiently remove or mitigate non-linearities for improved PI."], "second_cons": "The introduction mentions the limitations of polynomial approximation methods but doesn't delve into the specific details of why these methods are insufficient.", "second_pros": "The introduction effectively motivates the need for research into efficient PI by highlighting the privacy concerns related to proprietary LLMs and the practical limitations of current methods.", "summary": "This paper addresses the critical need for efficient private inference (PI) in large language models (LLMs) due to privacy concerns surrounding proprietary models.  Current PI methods face significant challenges due to high latency and communication overheads caused by non-linear operations, prompting the authors to explore a novel architecture that systematically addresses the role of non-linearities in LLMs for improved PI efficiency.  The significant performance limitations of existing solutions, which often neglect LayerNorm costs or rely on inaccurate polynomial approximations, further emphasize the need for a new approach."}}, {"page_end_idx": 3, "page_start_idx": 3, "section_number": 3, "section_title": "REMOVING NONLINEARITY IN TRANSFORMER-BASED LLMS", "details": {"details": "This section investigates the role of non-linearities (GELU and LayerNorm) in transformer-based decoder-only LLMs.  A controlled experimental framework systematically removes these non-linear components, training models from scratch to observe the effects.  Key findings include: LayerNorm-free models perform better with ReLU than GELU in the feed-forward network (FFN); training instability in Softmax-only models (only softmax as nonlinearity) can be mitigated by normalizing FFN weights; and a new phenomenon, 'entropic overload', where a disproportionate number of attention heads exhibit high entropy values, is observed and analyzed.  Shannon's entropy is used to analyze attention score distribution, showing that GELU causes significant entropic overload in LayerNorm-free models.  The analysis suggests that ReLU preserves more information in LayerNorm-free architectures.  The study concludes by providing practical guidelines for designing LLM architectures optimized for private inference (PI).", "first_cons": "The study primarily focuses on pre-training performance using perplexity as the main metric.

The first two stages focus on removing non-linearities (GELU and LayerNorm) from the LLM architecture, leading to a Softmax-only model. This is followed by a FLOPs reduction strategy, which involves merging linear layers within the feed-forward network (FFN) and pruning deeper FFNs. Finally, entropy regularization is introduced to improve the performance of the Softmax-only model by mitigating entropic overload. The results demonstrate that AERO achieves up to 4.23x communication reduction and 1.94x latency reduction compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while maintaining competitive performance in terms of perplexity.  The framework is validated on GPT-2 and Pythia models across various sizes and depths.  Different techniques for preventing training collapse in softmax-only models, like weight normalization, spectral normalization, and output scaling are investigated and compared, showing the effectiveness of learnable scaling factors.  The entropy regularization technique is carefully designed with key principles such as balanced entropy distribution, head-specific adaptation of thresholds, and tolerance margins, to prevent over-regularization and ensure consistent performance.
