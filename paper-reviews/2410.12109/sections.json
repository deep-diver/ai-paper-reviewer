Recent progress extends to multimodal LLMs incorporating visual and audio inputs. However, these models struggle with fine-grained cross-modal temporal understanding, especially when correlating events across audio and video streams.  The introduction highlights this limitation with the example of a video sequence where a person performs different actions over time, accompanied by sound events.  The goal is to address these challenges with a new dataset, OCTAV, and a new model, OMCAT.  OCTAV is designed to capture event transitions across audio and video streams by including timed question-answer pairs which focus on the transitions between events triggered by sounds. The provided example in Figure 1 illustrates a video clip showcasing different actions of a man and the correlated sound events that correspond with each action.  The goal is to achieve fine-grained cross-modal temporal understanding by using both audio and video to answer questions about those transitions.

It highlights the limitations of current models and datasets in handling such nuanced tasks, which involve precise synchronization and alignment between audio and visual inputs.  The limitations stem from several factors, including the lack of temporally aligned cross-modal datasets and a lack of clear understanding of how to effectively combine audio and visual modalities within unified models.\n\nThe discussion specifically addresses the shortcomings of existing LLMs in providing answers to questions requiring fine-grained timestamps anchored to specific events.  It points out that prior advancements have been largely concentrated on domain-specific models, i.e., either Video LLMs or Audio LLMs, each trained in isolation without considering precise cross-modal temporal relationships.  Existing audio-visual datasets are also criticized for their focus on open-ended question-answering tasks, lacking the temporal grounding necessary to accurately assess events relative to each other and within a larger context.\n\nThe authors emphasize the need for addressing the limitations of existing approaches. This includes the development of datasets with temporally aligned cross-modal information, more sophisticated unified models capable of handling fine-grained temporal dynamics, and a better understanding of how to combine audio and visual inputs effectively to generate accurate responses to complex queries involving both modalities.

It tackles this by creating a synthetic dataset with question-answer pairs centered around events in videos transitioned by sound events.  This is done in a two-step process: first identifying transitions between video events where the gap between end time and start time is less than 10 seconds and the total length is at most 30 seconds.  A sound event is then injected between these transitions, creating a video with an audio event between video segments. This design encourages models to learn the relationship between sounds and the events occurring in the videos, both before and after the sound.  The dataset is split into OCTAV-ST (single-turn) and OCTAV-MT (multi-turn) versions, depending on whether a single or multiple sound events are incorporated between video event transitions.  The OCTAV-ST dataset consists of 127,507 unique videos, with 2414 videos for testing, while the OCTAV-MT dataset contains 25,457 unique videos with 4818 for testing.  The data comes from existing datasets such as Youcook2, ActivityNet, COIN, UnAV-100, and HiREST, using the existing timestamps and captions for the video events. The audio events are randomly inserted.  The question-answer pairs are then generated using GPT-assisted generation, focusing on questions that capture the transition between events based on the sound event.  This synthetic approach allows for fine-grained temporal control and ensures the presence of temporally-aligned audio and video events, addressing a key limitation in existing multimodal datasets.

The architecture uses a visual encoder and an audio encoder, both pre-trained, to extract features. These features are then passed through adaptor layers to align them with the text embedding space of a large language model (LLM), specifically Vicuna 7B-v1.5.  The crucial innovation is the integration of temporal information through two methods: Interleaving Time Tokens (ITT) and Rotary Time Embeddings (ROTE). ITT interleaves learnable time tokens with audio and video features, while ROTE modifies the RoPE mechanism to use absolute timestamps for rotation angles.  The model training is a three-stage process: feature alignment, instruction tuning, and OCTAV-specific training. The first stage aligns the features from both modalities with textual data, the second improves cross-modal understanding via instruction tuning, and the final stage uses the custom OCTAV dataset to further enhance temporal understanding.
