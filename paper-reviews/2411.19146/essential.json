Existing optimization techniques often compromise accuracy or require extensive resources. This paper introduces Puzzle, a novel framework to efficiently optimize LLMs for specific hardware.  Puzzle employs neural architecture search (NAS) and a blockwise local knowledge distillation strategy to explore and refine model architectures that meet strict hardware constraints, while simultaneously maintaining high accuracy. \nPuzzle's effectiveness is demonstrated through Llama-3.1-Nemotron-51B, a model optimized for inference on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU.  Nemotron-51B achieves a 2.17x speedup and maintains 98.4% of its parent model's accuracy, showcasing Puzzle's ability to achieve substantial performance gains without sacrificing accuracy. The low computational cost of Puzzle, requiring just 45 billion tokens compared to over 15 trillion for the original model, makes it a practical tool for LLM optimization.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.19146/podcast.wav"}
