However, extending 3DGS to accurately model dynamic scenes, especially those containing specular surfaces, remains a significant challenge. Existing methods struggle with either dynamic scene reconstruction or specular object rendering, but not both simultaneously.  This limitation hinders the application of 3DGS to real-world scenarios with both motion and specular reflections.  The introduction highlights the lack of existing methods capable of accurately representing both dynamic aspects and specular surfaces within 3DGS frameworks.  This gap is the primary motivation for the work presented in the paper.", "first_cons": "The introduction section only points out the limitations of existing methods without offering detailed comparisons or analysis.  It does not provide a quantitative assessment of existing approaches' shortcomings, relying more on qualitative observations.", "first_pros": "The introduction effectively highlights a significant gap in current 3D scene reconstruction technology, specifically addressing the limitations of applying 3D Gaussian Splatting to dynamic specular scenes.  This clearly establishes the research problem and its practical significance.", "keypoints": ["3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers fast training and real-time rendering.", "Extending 3DGS to dynamic scenes with specular surfaces is challenging.", "Existing methods struggle to combine accurate representation of both dynamic scenes and specular surfaces.", "This limitation hinders real-world application of 3DGS."], "second_cons": "The introduction section lacks specific examples of real-world applications where this limitation poses a significant problem.

Current methods fail to adequately address both dynamic scene reconstruction and specular object rendering simultaneously, thus motivating the need for the proposed novel approach."}}, {"page_end_idx": 5, "page_start_idx": 3, "section_number": 3, "section_title": "METHOD", "details": {"details": "The SpectroMotion method uses a three-stage coarse-to-fine training strategy to reconstruct dynamic specular scenes.  Stage 1 (static) stabilizes the static scene geometry using vanilla 3D Gaussian Splatting, minimizing photometric loss between rendered and ground truth images. Stage 2 (dynamic) introduces a deformable Gaussian MLP to model dynamic scenes, minimizing normal loss between rendered and ground truth normal maps. Stage 3 (specular) incorporates a deformable reflection MLP and a deformable environment map to handle time-varying lighting conditions for accurate specular color prediction.  This process involves physical normal estimation for deformed 3D Gaussians, which uses both the shortest and longest axes to compute the rotation matrix and scales normal residuals based on the ratio of oblateness between canonical and deformed 3D Gaussians for accuracy.  The final color is a combination of diffuse and specular components.  The loss function includes photometric loss, normal loss, and a regularization term for the normal residual.

Qualitative results in Figures 4 and 5 further illustrate the enhanced visual quality of SpectroMotion's reconstruction, especially regarding the rendering of dynamic specular scenes.
