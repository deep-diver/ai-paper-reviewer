Our method stabilizes the scene geometry through three stages. In the static stage, we stabilize the geometry of the static scene by minimizing photometric loss Lcolor between vanilla 3DGS renders and ground truth images. The dynamic stage combines canonical 3D Gaussians G with a deformable Gaussian MLP to model dynamic scenes while simultaneously minimizing normal loss Lnormal between rendered normal map N\u00b9 and gradient normal map from depth map D\u00b9, thus further enhancing the overall scene geometry. Finally, the specular stage introduces a deformable reflection MLP to handle changing environment lighting, deforming reflection directions w to query a canonical environment map for specular color c. It is then combined with diffuse color ca (using zero-order spherical harmonics) and learnable specular tint Stint per 3D Gaussian to obtain the final color canal. This approach enables the modeling of dynamic specular scenes and high-quality novel view rendering.", "description": "The figure illustrates the three-stage training process of SpectroMotion for reconstructing dynamic specular scenes, including static scene stabilization, dynamic scene modeling, and specular reflection handling.", "section": "3 METHOD"}, {"figure_path": "2410.17249/figures/figures_6_0.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Normal estimation. (a) shows that flatter 3D Gaussians align better with scene surfaces, their shortest axis closely matching the surface normal. In contrast, less flat 3D Gaussians fit less accurately, with their shortest axis diverging from the surface normal. (b) shows that when the deformed 3D Gaussian becomes flatter (t = t1), normal residual \u0394n is rotated by R1 and scaled down by \u03b2t1/\u03b2, as flatter Gaussians require smaller normal residuals. Conversely, when the deformation results in a less flat shape (t = t2), \u0394n is rotated by R2 and amplified by \u03b2t2/\u03b2, requiring a larger correction to align the shortest axis with the surface normal. (c) shows how \u03b3k changes with \u03c9 (where \u03c9 = v\u22a5/v) for k = 1, k = 5, and k = 50. Larger \u03c9 indicates less flat Gaussians, while smaller \u03c9 represents flatter Gaussians. As k increases, \u03b3k decreases more steeply as \u03c9 rises. For k = 5, we observe a balanced behavior: \u03b3k approaches 1 for low \u03c9 and 0 for high \u03c9, providing a nuanced penalty adjustment across different Gaussian shapes.", "description": "Figure 3 illustrates the method for physical normal estimation for deformed 3D Gaussians, showing how flatter Gaussians align better with scene surfaces and how normal residuals are adjusted based on Gaussian flatness.", "section": "3.3 PHYSICAL NORMAL ESTIMATION"}, {"figure_path": "2410.17249/figures/figures_7_0.png", "caption": "Figure 1: Our method, SpectroMotion, recovers and renders dynamic scenes with higher-quality reflections compared to prior work.
