Existing methods struggled to accurately represent shiny surfaces in motion. SpectroMotion addresses this by employing 3D Gaussian Splatting, a method for efficient 3D modeling and rendering. It adds a few clever improvements: a correction method for accurate surface normal calculations (important for rendering shiny surfaces), an adaptable environment map to handle changes in lighting as the scene moves, and a training process that improves both the shapes of objects and the colors of the shiny parts.  Tests showed that SpectroMotion is better than other methods at creating these types of 3D models, even with complicated scenes and moving specular objects.  It is currently the only method capable of producing photorealistic results."}
