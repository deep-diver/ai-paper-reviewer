Existing methods struggled to handle both the dynamic movement and realistic reflections. SpectroMotion overcomes this by using three main techniques:  It improves how it estimates the direction of surface normals (which are important for calculating reflections), uses a flexible environment map that adjusts to changing light conditions, and trains the model in multiple stages to get better results.  Testing showed SpectroMotion produces higher quality results compared to other approaches, especially for complex scenes.  It's the first 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can render realistic dynamic specular scenes."}
