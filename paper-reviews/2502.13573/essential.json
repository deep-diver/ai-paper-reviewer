This paper investigates this issue, revealing that characteristics of source data like category and feature information don't greatly affect target domain performance. Surprisingly, **even noise can be useful source!** The study employs two supervised learning methods and seven SHDA techniques on approximately 330 SHDA tasks, challenging traditional assumptions about informative source data. These counter-intuitive findings are very novel. \n\nThe key to unlocking knowledge transfer in SHDA lies in the transferability and discriminability of the source domain itself. To illustrate the discovery, the paper introduces a unified **Knowledge Transfer Framework (KTF)** and designs experiments with various noise domains. The study finds that ensuring these properties in source samples boosts knowledge transfer, regardless of their origin (image, text, noise). Datasets and codes are publicly available, encouraging further research.", "affiliation": "Beijing Teleinfo Technology Company Ltd., China Academy of Information and Communications Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Transfer Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.13573/podcast.wav"}
