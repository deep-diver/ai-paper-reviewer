Current LLM quantization methods struggle with outliers in weights and activations, leading to significant accuracy loss. FLATQUANT addresses this by identifying optimal affine transformations for each layer to flatten the distributions of weights and activations before quantization.  This approach is combined with Kronecker decomposition to reduce the computational cost of the transformations and kernel fusion to minimize runtime overhead. Extensive experiments show FLATQUANT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving less than 1% accuracy drop with W4A4 quantization on LLaMA-3-70B and significant speedups (up to 2.3x for prefill and 1.7x for decoding)."}
