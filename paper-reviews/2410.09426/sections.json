It introduces the concept of quantization error as a key performance metric and explains how sharp distributions and outliers lead to increased error and error propagation across transformer layers.

The authors discuss the limitations of existing pre-quantization methods such as per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation, arguing that they are suboptimal in achieving the desired flatness of weights and activations.  They point out that LLMs tend to have extreme outliers in activations, which negatively impacts quantization performance. Pre-quantization methods, while attempting to suppress these outliers, can still result in distributions that are too steep, causing substantial quantization errors. This motivates the introduction of FLATQUANT, a post-training quantization method specifically designed to address this flatness issue, which is a core contribution of their work.  The section provides a solid foundation for understanding the significance of FLATQUANT by contrasting it with existing techniques and emphasizing the crucial role of a flat weight/activation distribution in reducing quantization errors.", "first_cons": "The analysis of existing methods (per-channel scaling and Hadamard transformation) is somewhat brief and lacks detailed quantitative comparisons.

Instead of relying on pre-quantization transformations that often fall short of achieving optimal flatness, FLATQUANT identifies optimal affine transformations for each linear layer after training using a lightweight, block-wise training strategy. To reduce the inference overhead, Kronecker decomposition is applied to the transformation matrices, effectively reducing both computational and memory demands.  Further optimization is achieved by fusing all operations (affine transformation and quantization) into a single kernel, minimizing global memory access and kernel launch overhead.  The training objective is minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) during quantization. This is accomplished via a sequential, layer-wise training process across Transformer blocks.  Learnable clipping thresholds are also introduced to handle outliers after the affine transformation.
