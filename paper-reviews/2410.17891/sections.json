These capabilities stem primarily from the scaling up of autoregressive (AR) models, which utilize a left-to-right sequential process for both training and inference.  While AR models have demonstrated remarkable intelligence in various tasks, they face limitations such as difficulties in future planning and self-correction.  These constraints have motivated research into alternative architectures, leading to the exploration of text diffusion models (DLMs) as a potential solution for next-generation LLMs.  DLMs offer advantages like controllable, any-order, and parallel text generation, potentially overcoming limitations inherent in the AR approach.  However, current DLMs are relatively small compared to their AR counterparts, hindering fair comparison and necessitating further research and scaling efforts.", "first_cons": "Current diffusion language models (DLMs) are significantly smaller than their autoregressive (AR) counterparts, limiting their competitiveness and preventing a fair comparison on various benchmarks.", "first_pros": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) present a promising new paradigm for text generation, potentially addressing limitations of autoregressive (AR) models.", "keypoints": ["Autoregressive (AR) models are the foundation of current LLMs, but face limitations in future planning and self-correction.", "Text diffusion models (DLMs) offer potential advantages such as controllable, any-order, and parallel text generation.", "Current DLMs are relatively small compared to AR models (127M-1B parameters vs billions for AR), thus requiring scaling efforts to be truly competitive.", "The limitations of AR models, particularly in future planning and self-correction, highlight the need for exploration of alternative model architectures such as DLMs"], "second_cons": "Training diffusion models from scratch at scale is challenging, requiring significant computational resources.", "second_pros": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) exhibit promising capabilities in intermediate token correction and global planning, which address key limitations of AR models.", "summary": "This introduction highlights the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily driven by autoregressive (AR) models, while acknowledging their limitations in areas like future planning and self-correction.

It begins by describing diffusion models as latent variable generative models characterized by forward and reverse Markov processes. The forward process adds noise to the data gradually, while the reverse process denoises it to reconstruct the original data.  The section introduces the forward process, represented by q(x1:T|x0), which gradually corrupts the initial data x0 into a sequence of increasingly noisy variables x1:T. It then describes the backward Markov process, denoted by p\u03b8(x0:T), which models the joint probability of the sequence x0:T. The parameters \u03b8 are learned by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of x0, which can be optimized through the variational lower bound (ELBO). The ELBO is then mathematically defined, incorporating the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the forward and reverse processes.  For continuous text diffusion, the forward process is defined using a Gaussian distribution, where the variance increases over time. For discrete diffusion, the forward process is defined using a categorical distribution, and it employs an absorbing state representing a masked token. The section explains the continuous-time version of the discrete diffusion process, which avoids bias associated with discrete time intervals and allows for sampling from any noise level. This continuous-time formulation forms the basis for the subsequent model adaptation discussed in the paper.

It begins by formulating the continuous-time discrete diffusion process, showing the forward transition distribution between arbitrary points.  The core idea is to bridge the gap between AR and DLM objectives.  The authors achieve this by introducing an adaptation approach that unifies the language modeling objectives of both AR and DLM and addresses architectural differences through attention mask annealing and inheritance of the shift operation from AR models. A sampling algorithm is then presented to generate text using the adapted model. The approach uses a continuous-time framework, avoiding the explicit use of time embeddings which are commonly found in diffusion models but are not present in AR models.", "first_cons": "The adaptation approach, while innovative, might be overly simplistic and could neglect crucial aspects of diffusion modeling, potentially affecting the quality of the resulting DLM.", "first_pros": "The proposed adaptation method offers a straightforward way to leverage the extensive pre-trained AR models, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch for DLMs. This significantly saves resources and time.", "keypoints": ["Unifies AR and DLM objectives to facilitate adaptation.", "Employs attention mask annealing to transition from causal masking in AR models to bi-directional attention in DLMs.", "Inherits the shift operation from AR models for improved loss calculation.", "Utilizes a continuous-time discrete diffusion process, avoiding the need for explicit time embeddings."], "second_cons": "The evaluation of the adapted models is limited to a specific set of benchmarks, which may not fully represent the range of capabilities of both AR and DLM.

The adaptation process involves techniques like attention mask annealing,  a shift operation, and a time-embedding-free architecture. The models are evaluated on a range of tasks including language modeling, reasoning, and commonsense benchmarks. DiffuGPT outperforms GPT-2 in most tasks, and the 7B parameter DiffuLLaMA achieves state-of-the-art results among DLMs and shows competitive performance with its AR counterpart, LLaMA-2, on various tasks, particularly excelling in tasks requiring less sequential token generation such as infilling, despite a significant gap in training tokens (200B for DLMs vs. much larger datasets for AR LMs).  The study highlights the efficacy of adapting pre-trained AR LMs to create competitive DLMs, addressing challenges associated with training DLMs from scratch at scale.  Evaluation metrics include accuracy for reasoning and commonsense tasks, ROUGE scores for infilling, and perplexity. The results reveal that scaling up the size of the DLMs leads to better performance, and that DLMs are particularly strong at infilling tasks and global planning tasks.", "first_cons": "The primary limitation is the significant gap in training data between the adapted DLMs and their AR counterparts.
