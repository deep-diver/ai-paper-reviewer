However, these AR models have limitations, including difficulties with future planning and self-correction.  This has motivated research into alternative architectures, such as diffusion language models (DLMs). DLMs offer potential advantages in controllable, any-order, and parallel text generation, as well as in intermediate token correction and global planning.  Despite this potential, current DLMs are relatively small compared to AR models and lack comprehensive evaluation on standard language modeling benchmarks.  The significant resource requirements for training DLMs from scratch at scale present a major challenge.

It begins by formulating the continuous-time discrete diffusion process, showing the forward transition distribution between arbitrary points.  The core idea is to bridge the gap between the discrete diffusion and autoregressive objectives by demonstrating a connection between them. This connection enables an adaptation approach which includes attention mask annealing, shift operations, and a time-embedding-free architecture.  The approach is designed to address the architectural differences and biases between AR and diffusion modeling, aiming for a streamlined adaptation process to build competitive DLMs from pre-trained AR models.  Finally, it explains the sampling algorithm used, showing how it leverages the shift operation and the time-embedding-free architecture for generating text.
