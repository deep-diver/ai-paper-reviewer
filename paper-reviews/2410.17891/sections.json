These capabilities stem primarily from scaling up autoregressive (AR) models, which utilize a left-to-right sequential process for generation and learning. However, AR models have limitations, notably in areas like future planning and self-correction.  These shortcomings have driven research toward alternative architectures for next-generation LLMs, with text diffusion models (DLMs) emerging as a promising area of exploration.\n\nDLMs offer potential advantages over AR models, including the ability to perform any-order and parallel text generation, as well as allowing for intermediate token correction and more effective global planning. These capabilities could address key limitations inherent in the AR approach. Despite the potential benefits, DLMs have been studied at a considerably smaller scale than their AR counterparts, hindering fair comparisons.  Training DLMs from scratch at scale also presents significant challenges. The relatively small model sizes and under-training have limited their competitiveness with AR models on language modeling benchmarks.", "first_cons": "Current DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale compared to their AR counterparts, hindering fair comparisons on language modeling benchmarks.", "first_pros": "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer potential advantages over autoregressive (AR) models, including the ability to perform any-order and parallel text generation, intermediate token correction, and more effective global planning.", "keypoints": ["Autoregressive (AR) Language Models are the current standard but have limitations in future planning and self-correction", "Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are a promising alternative, showing promise in any-order generation, parallel generation, intermediate token correction and global planning", "DLMs have been studied at a smaller scale (127M-1B parameters) than AR models, lacking fair comparisons and hindering their competitiveness", "Training DLMs from scratch at scale remains challenging"], "second_cons": "Training DLMs from scratch at scale remains challenging.", "second_pros": "These capabilities of DLMs could address key limitations inherent in the AR approach.", "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) based on autoregressive (AR) architectures have achieved impressive results, but limitations in future planning and self-correction exist.

It begins by formulating the continuous-time discrete diffusion process, establishing a connection between the discrete diffusion and autoregressive objectives, and proposes an adaptation approach and sampling algorithm.  The key element is bridging the gap between the objectives and architectures of AR and diffusion models. This is done through three main strategies: 1) **Attention Mask Annealing**: Gradually removing the causal masking bias from the AR models, creating a shift from unidirectional to bidirectional attention. This is crucial as diffusion models operate on noisy inputs and require a bi-directional perspective.  2) **Shift Operation**: Inheriting the shift operation from AR models where the output layer predicts the next token. This operation, maintained during adaptation, aligns the training objectives. 3) **Time-embedding-Free Architecture**:  Instead of using separate time-embedding layers, the model leverages the implicit time information contained in the noise structure. This removes the need for explicit time embedding layers common in diffusion models and simplifies the adaptation process.  The section culminates in Algorithm 1 (Adaptation Training) and Algorithm 2 (Sampling), providing a practical implementation of the adaptation and generation processes.  The algorithms detail how the AR model is modified to incorporate diffusion principles, showing the gradual transition from causal masking to full attention during training.", "first_cons": "The adaptation approach, while simple, might not be optimal.  The annealing of the attention mask and other adaptations may not fully address all the fundamental differences between AR and diffusion processes, potentially leading to suboptimal performance in the resulting diffusion models.", "first_pros": "The proposed model successfully unifies the seemingly disparate objectives of autoregressive and diffusion language modeling, offering a simple and effective pathway for adapting existing AR models to the diffusion framework. This significantly reduces the computational cost and effort involved in training diffusion models from scratch.", "keypoints": ["The adaptation involves three key strategies: Attention Mask Annealing, Shift Operation, and a Time-embedding-Free Architecture.", "The adaptation process unifies AR and diffusion modeling objectives.", "Algorithms 1 and 2 provide a practical implementation of the adaptation and sampling processes.", "The model uses a continuous-time discrete diffusion process instead of a discrete-time one, allowing for more flexibility in sampling from any noisy representation during generation.", "The approach addresses the key differences between AR and diffusion models by breaking the causal masking bias and inheriting the shift operation from AR models.", "The time-embedding-free architecture simplifies model training and reduces the number of parameters, making it more efficient than traditional diffusion models with time-embedding layers."], "second_cons": "The effectiveness of the proposed adaptation approach is mainly evaluated through empirical results, with limited theoretical analysis to guarantee optimal adaptation.", "second_pros": "The model offers a significant improvement in terms of computational efficiency, particularly by avoiding the resource-intensive process of training diffusion models from scratch. Leveraging readily available, pre-trained AR models as a foundation drastically reduces the training time and resource requirements.", "summary": "This section presents a novel method to adapt existing autoregressive language models into diffusion language models, bridging the architectural and objective differences between the two approaches.  The key strategies are attention mask annealing, shift operation inheritance, and a time-embedding-free architecture, resulting in computationally efficient algorithms for both training and sampling.  This method allows for leveraging pre-trained autoregressive models to build competitive diffusion models."}}, {"page_end_idx": 6, "page_start_idx": 6, "section_number": 4, "section_title": "EXPERIMENT", "details": {"details": "This section details the experimental setup and evaluation of the adapted diffusion language models (DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA).
