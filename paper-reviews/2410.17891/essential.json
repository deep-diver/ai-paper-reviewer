Unlike traditional autoregressive models, DLMs offer potential advantages such as controllable and parallel text generation. However, training DLMs from scratch at large scales is computationally expensive.  To overcome this, the researchers developed a method to adapt readily available and well-trained autoregressive language models into DLMs.  They demonstrate that this adaptation process is efficient, requiring significantly less training data than training a DLM from scratch.  Their approach involves unifying the training objectives of both autoregressive and diffusion models, and carefully managing the differences in their attention mechanisms.  The resultant adapted DLMs, named DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, exhibit strong performance, outperforming earlier DLMs and even being competitive with their autoregressive counterparts on several language modeling benchmarks.  They released the models, code, and datasets, enabling further research and development in the field. The work expands upon previous research by significantly increasing the scale of DLMs, facilitating more comprehensive comparisons with traditional autoregressive models and paving the way for future improvements and advancements in DLM technology."}
