Instead of training DLMs from scratch, which is computationally expensive, the researchers propose adapting existing large autoregressive language models (AR LMs) into DLMs.  They demonstrate a simple continual pre-training approach that bridges the differences between AR and diffusion modeling objectives.  Their method involves a technique called 'attention mask annealing' to gradually transition from the unidirectional attention of AR LMs to the bidirectional attention of DLMs.  They also adapt the 'shift operation' from AR models. This approach allows them to train DLMs with significantly less computational resources. Experiments show that their approach can successfully convert AR models of various sizes (127M to 7B parameters) into competitive DLMs, outperforming previous DLMs and achieving comparable results to their AR counterparts. The models show good performance in various tasks like text generation, in-context learning, and filling in the middle of sentences.  Furthermore, the researchers release their models and code, encouraging further research and development in this area."}
