The researchers propose a novel approach to adapt readily available, large, pre-trained autoregressive language models (AR LMs) into DLMs.  They demonstrate the feasibility of their method by converting several open-source AR LMs (ranging from 127M to 7B parameters) into DLMs.  The key innovation lies in bridging the differences in the objectives and architectures of AR LMs and DLMs.  They achieve this by introducing a simple continual pre-training approach that addresses the architectural discrepancies and utilizes techniques such as attention mask annealing and shift operations. Through systematic evaluation on several benchmarks, they show that the adapted DLMs (named DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA) achieve state-of-the-art performance for DLMs and are competitive with their AR counterparts. Notably, the 7B parameter model (DiffuLLaMA) outperforms previous DLMs and demonstrates several advanced capabilities like in-context learning and code generation. The research also addresses the limitations of prior DLM evaluations by employing more comprehensive benchmark tasks. Overall, the paper presents a significant contribution to the field by providing an efficient and effective way to build high-performing DLMs, paving the way for broader adoption and further advancements in text generation research."}
