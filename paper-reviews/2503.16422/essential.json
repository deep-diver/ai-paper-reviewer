Current 4DGS methods require substantial storage and suffer from slow rendering speed. This paper identifies two key sources of temporal redundancy. First, many Gaussians have short lifespans, leading to excessive numbers. Second, only a subset of Gaussians contributes to each frame, yet all are processed during rendering. The goal is to compress 4DGS by reducing the number of Gaussians while preserving rendering quality. \n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces **4DGS-1K**, running at over 1000 FPS. The proposed method introduces the Spatial-Temporal Variation Score, a new pruning criterion that removes short-lifespan Gaussians while encouraging longer temporal spans. The paper also stores a mask for active Gaussians across consecutive frames, reducing redundant computations. Compared to vanilla 4DGS, 4DGS-1K achieves a **41\u00d7 reduction in storage** and **9\u00d7 faster rasterization speed**, maintaining visual quality.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16422/podcast.wav"}
