It begins by briefly explaining reinforcement learning and the DPO algorithm.  Then, the core of the methodology, LongReward, is introduced.  LongReward uses an off-the-shelf LLM to evaluate model responses across four human-valued dimensions: **helpfulness, logicality, faithfulness, and completeness**. Each dimension has a carefully designed assessment pipeline using the judge LLM and the chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting technique to improve reliability.
