This is a significant issue because it prevents users from easily generating videos with custom camera perspectives from their own video footage.  Existing methods either require synchronized multi-view videos or accurate camera pose and depth estimation, which is not always practical or feasible for real-world applications.\n\nTo tackle these issues, the paper introduces ReCapture, a novel method that effectively reangles videos by first creating a noisy anchor video from user-provided footage and a new camera trajectory using either multiview diffusion models or depth-based point cloud rendering.  This noisy video is then refined into a temporally consistent video using a masked video fine-tuning technique with spatial and temporal LoRAs. This approach avoids the need for paired video data or accurate depth estimation, enabling realistic re-angling of user-provided videos with complex scene motion and dynamic content.  The results demonstrate that ReCapture outperforms other methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.", "affiliation": "Google", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}}
