While impressive advancements exist, understanding how visual perception tasks (depth and saliency) correlate with detection accuracy is crucial for system optimization.  This study explores this relationship using state-of-the-art models, on standard datasets. \nThis research reveals that **visual saliency correlates more strongly with object detection accuracy compared to depth prediction.**  The effect varies across object categories; correlations are significantly higher for larger objects. This suggests that incorporating visual saliency features into object detection models could be highly beneficial, particularly for specific categories.  The findings are important for improving both model architecture and dataset design.", "affiliation": "Dept. of Artificial Intelligence\nUniversity of Malta", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}}
