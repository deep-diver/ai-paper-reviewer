(1) Calculate ZIP-FIT Alignment of each source example with the target dataset using gzip compression. (2) Rank all source examples based on these alignment scores. (3) Select the top-K most aligned examples for fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tune a large language model using the selected top-K examples to improve performance on the target task.", "description": "The figure illustrates the ZIP-FIT algorithm, detailing how it uses gzip compression to measure alignment between source and target datasets for efficient data selection and fine-tuning of large language models.", "section": "ZIP-FIT: AN EMBEDDING-FREE DATA SELECTION ALGORITHM VIA COMPRESSION-BASED ALIGNMENT FOR LM FINE-TUNING"}]
