(1) Calculate ZIP-FIT Alignment of each source example with the target dataset using gzip compression. (2) Rank all source examples based on these alignment scores. (3) Select the top-K most aligned examples for fine-tuning. (4) Fine-tune a large language model using the selected top-K examples to improve performance on the target task.", "description": "This figure illustrates the ZIP-FIT algorithm's process for selecting task-specific data by ranking source data examples based on their compression-based alignment with the target dataset and then using the top-k aligned examples to fine-tune a large language model.", "section": "2 ZIP-FIT: AN EMBEDDING-FREE DATA SELECTION ALGORITHM VIA COMPRESSION-BASED ALIGNMENT FOR LM FINE-TUNING"}]
