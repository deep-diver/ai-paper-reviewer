For each sample, it shows the beginning portion of the text snippet and the corresponding ZIP-FIT alignment score. The alignment score, ranging from 0.4853 to 0.5000, reflects the similarity between the selected sample and the target task distribution as measured by ZIP-FIT's compression-based alignment method. The snippets illustrate the types of code examples ZIP-FIT tends to select, which are relevant to the target code generation task.", "section": "E QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18194/tables/table_19_0.md", "caption": "Table 1: Beginning characters of the top 20 samples selected by ZIP-FIT when the target task is code generation.", "description": "This table presents a qualitative analysis of the top 20 code samples selected by the ZIP-FIT algorithm for a code generation task.
