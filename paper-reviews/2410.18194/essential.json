Instead of relying on embeddings or n-grams, ZIP-FIT directly measures alignment through compression efficiency: data compressing well with the target task is considered highly relevant.  Experiments on Autoformalization and code generation demonstrate that ZIP-FIT outperforms existing methods like DSIR and D4, achieving faster convergence and lower cross-entropy loss.  It shows that smaller, well-aligned datasets often outperform larger, less-targeted ones, highlighting the importance of data quality over quantity.  ZIP-FIT is also computationally efficient, significantly faster than existing techniques. This work offers a new approach to data selection, providing insights into the relationship between data quality, task alignment, and model training efficiency.  It suggests that compression-based similarity effectively captures both syntactic and structural patterns crucial for effective model training."}
