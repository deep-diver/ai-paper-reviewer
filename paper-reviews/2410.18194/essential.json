Instead of using complex methods, ZIP-FIT uses a simple compression algorithm (gzip) to measure how well potential training data matches the specific task.  The results show that using data selected by ZIP-FIT leads to faster training and better performance on two tasks: turning natural language mathematical statements into formal code (Autoformalization) and generating computer code from natural language descriptions. ZIP-FIT is also faster than other existing data selection techniques.  The study demonstrates that focusing on a smaller, well-aligned dataset is much more effective than using a larger, less relevant one.  This is important because it shows the benefits of careful data selection and highlights the usefulness of compression as a way to gauge data quality for machine learning tasks."}
