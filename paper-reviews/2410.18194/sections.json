Unlike existing methods that rely on embeddings or simplistic representations, ZIP-FIT leverages gzip compression to directly measure the alignment between potential training data and the target task distribution. The core idea is that compression-based similarity captures both syntactic and structural patterns relevant to the target task, enabling more precise selection of task-relevant data.  The algorithm involves computing the normalized compression distance (NCD) between each potential data point and the target task examples.  Data points with higher average NCD scores (indicating better alignment) are selected for fine-tuning the LM. Experiments on Autoformalization and Python code generation demonstrate that ZIP-FIT significantly outperforms leading baselines like DSIR and D4, achieving up to 85.1% faster convergence and lower cross-entropy loss.
