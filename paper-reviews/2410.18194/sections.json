The authors point out that existing data selection methods often ignore task-specific requirements or rely on simplistic approximations, failing to capture the nuanced patterns necessary for complex tasks like Autoformalization or code generation.  These methods either ignore task-specific requirements entirely or utilize noisy representations like hashed n-gram features, which suffer from collisions and introduce noise.

The core idea is that gzip compression implicitly captures both syntactic and structural patterns relevant to the target task, allowing for a more precise selection of truly task-relevant data.  The algorithm works by calculating a normalized compression distance (NCD) between each data point in a large source dataset and the target dataset.  Data points with the lowest average NCD (highest alignment) are selected for fine-tuning.  This approach contrasts with existing methods that rely on noisy representations (like hashed n-grams) or computationally expensive neural embeddings.  Experiments on Autoformalization and Python code generation show that ZIP-FIT outperforms leading baselines (DSIR and D4) in terms of both speed and model performance, with models trained on ZIP-FIT selected data achieving their lowest cross-entropy loss up to 85.1% faster and ZIP-FIT selection up to 65.8% faster than DSIR, and two orders of magnitude faster than D4.
