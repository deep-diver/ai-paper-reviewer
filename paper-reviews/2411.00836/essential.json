This paper introduces DynaMath, a new dynamic visual math benchmark to address this issue. DynaMath comprises 501 seed questions, each represented as a Python program, which generates numerous variants, allowing for a thorough assessment of the models' ability to generalize and handle variations.  The study shows that the worst-case accuracy of these VLMs is significantly lower than their average-case accuracy, highlighting a critical weakness that requires further investigation. \nThe DynaMath benchmark is designed to encourage the development of more robust VLMs by focusing on their ability to generalize and handle various input conditions, as opposed to simply memorizing answers. The results emphasize the need for more research on the robustness of VLM reasoning capabilities and provide valuable insights for developing more reliable mathematical reasoning models. This benchmark is a significant step forward in evaluating and advancing the field of vision-language models by providing a more rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of the generalization ability of these models.", "affiliation": "University of California, Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Visual Question Answering"}}
