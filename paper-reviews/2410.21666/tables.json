The algorithms compared are: Independent Joint (where the joint distribution is generated independently from the marginals), Successive Linearization Algorithm (SLA), Max-Seeking Greedy, and Zero-Seeking Greedy. For each algorithm, the average achieved joint entropy across the 100 simulation runs is reported along with its standard deviation.", "section": "Related Work"}]
