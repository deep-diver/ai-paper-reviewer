{"importance": "This paper is important because it **introduces a novel lossy compression framework** that is particularly relevant for applications with distributional shifts, such as joint compression and retrieval.  It **offers theoretical insights and a practical algorithm**, advancing the field of minimum entropy coupling and opening avenues for research in Markov decision processes and rate-limited communication scenarios.", "summary": "A new lossy compression framework handles reconstruction distribution divergence by integrating a bottleneck, extending minimum entropy coupling and offering guaranteed performance.", "takeaways": ["A novel lossy compression framework, Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck (MEC-B), is proposed to address scenarios where the reconstruction distribution diverges from the source distribution.", "MEC-B is decomposed into two subproblems: Entropy-Bounded Information Maximization (EBIM) for the encoder and Minimum Entropy Coupling (MEC) for the decoder, facilitating separate optimization and analysis.", "Experiments in Markov Coding Games (MCGs) demonstrate the practical application of MEC-B, highlighting trade-offs between MDP rewards and receiver accuracy under various compression rates."], "tldr": "Lossy compression usually assumes the reconstruction distribution matches the source.  This paper tackles the challenge when this assumption fails, a common issue in scenarios like joint compression and retrieval where processing might alter the distribution.  Existing methods struggle in these situations, and simply constraining the code length isn't enough to prevent decoder collapse.\nThe proposed Minimum Entropy Coupling with Bottleneck (MEC-B) integrates a bottleneck to control stochasticity and ensures the output follows a specific distribution.  It's broken down into two solvable problems: Entropy-Bounded Information Maximization (EBIM) for the encoder and MEC for the decoder.  Experiments on Markov Coding Games showcase its effectiveness compared to standard compression, demonstrating a flexible balance between reward and reconstruction accuracy under various compression rates.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}}
