This is known as source bias, which hurts the information access ecosystem.  However, the reasons for this bias were not clear. This paper explains information retrieval with a causal graph, showing that PLM retrievers use perplexity features for relevance, resulting in source bias by favoring documents with low perplexity.  Theoretical analysis showed the positive correlation between gradients in language modeling and retrieval tasks.\n\nBased on the analysis, the authors suggest a causal inference-time debiasing method, called Causal Diagnosis and Correction (CDC).  CDC identifies the bias effect of perplexity and separates it from the overall relevance score. Experiments across three domains showed that CDC is effective at debiasing, **highlighting the validity of the explanatory framework**. The results showed that PLM-based retrievers assign higher relevance scores to documents with lower perplexity because these models have gradients of MLM and IR loss functions, leading to bias.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Information Extraction"}, "podcast_path": "2503.08684/podcast.wav"}
