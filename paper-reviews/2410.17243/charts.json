Furthermore, the iteration time of Inf-CL scales linearly with batch size, leading to a stable training duration of approximately 59 hours per epoch.", "description": "The chart compares the training speed (iteration time and total time) of three different methods (CLIP, OpenCLIP, and Inf-CL) for training a ViT-L/14 CLIP model on 8xA800 GPUs across various batch sizes.", "section": "4 EXPERIMENTS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.17243/charts/charts_15_0.png", "caption": "Figure 5: Performance of ViT-B/32 across Varying Batch Sizes.
