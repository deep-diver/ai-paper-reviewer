This paper presents Inf-CL, a novel method tackling this limitation. Inf-CL cleverly partitions the similarity matrix into smaller, manageable tiles, preventing its full instantiation.  This tile-based strategy is further enhanced with a multi-level approach, leveraging both cross-GPU and in-GPU parallelization to optimize communication and computation. This results in a memory footprint that scales linearly instead of quadratically with batch size.  The results show Inf-CL can handle vastly larger batch sizes (up to 12M) than previous methods, training a CLIP-ViT-L/14 model without sacrificing accuracy. The achieved memory reduction is substantial \u2013 two orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art.  Inf-CL achieves this impressive result with comparable training speed."}
