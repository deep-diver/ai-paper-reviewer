The core problem is that the memory needed for contrastive loss scales quadratically with batch size, limiting training.  Inf-CL solves this by using a 'tile-based' approach. Instead of calculating similarity between all data points at once (creating a large matrix), Inf-CL breaks this calculation down into smaller, manageable 'tiles'. This drastically cuts memory usage.  Furthermore, Inf-CL uses a multi-level strategy to leverage the hierarchical structure of modern computer systems, improving efficiency across multiple GPUs and CPU cores.  Experiments show Inf-CL training a large vision-language model (CLIP) with batch sizes up to 12 million, achieving near-linear memory scaling and comparable training speed to the state-of-the-art, despite a two-order-of-magnitude memory reduction.  The code is publicly available. This work significantly advances contrastive learning techniques, enabling the training of substantially larger and more complex models."}
