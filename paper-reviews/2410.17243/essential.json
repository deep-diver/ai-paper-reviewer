This paper presents Inf-CL, a novel technique that addresses this constraint. Inf-CL utilizes a tile-based computation approach, breaking down the loss calculation into smaller, manageable blocks, avoiding the need to store the entire similarity matrix. This is combined with a multi-level tiling strategy to improve efficiency across multiple GPUs. Experiments show that Inf-CL achieves remarkable results: it enables training with batch sizes reaching millions while maintaining accuracy comparable to previous methods.  This significantly reduces memory demands, allowing contrastive training of large models previously deemed infeasible. The improved efficiency, scalability, and accuracy offered by Inf-CL are major contributions to the field of contrastive learning and open up possibilities for more advanced model training and applications."}
