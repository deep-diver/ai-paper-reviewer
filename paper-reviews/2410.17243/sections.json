To resolve this, a tile-wise contrastive learning method is introduced. This method avoids the full materialization of X through iterative accumulation between tiles, thereby significantly reducing memory usage.  The process is broken down into a forward and backward pass, both utilizing the tile-wise approach.  The forward pass focuses on efficient calculation of the log-sum-exp (LSE) values through serial merging of smaller LSE values from individual tiles.  This uses a numerically stable approach (Equation 4) to prevent overflow issues and ensures accurate calculation of the final LSE vector.  The backward pass, similarly based on a tile-wise approach, is optimized for computing gradients efficiently, and it also employs iterative accumulation to avoid storing the entire gradient matrix in memory, again, utilizing a numerically stable method for stability (Equation 7). Furthermore, a multi-level tiling strategy is presented which combines both cross-GPU tiling (coarse-grained) and in-GPU tiling (fine-grained) for enhanced efficiency.  Cross-GPU tiling distributes computation across multiple GPUs with asynchronous communication for reduced overhead.  In-GPU tiling leverages the hierarchical structure of GPUs to distribute the computation across CUDA cores, reducing I/O overhead by fusing multiple operations into a single kernel.  The method achieves near-linear memory scaling, enabling substantially increased batch sizes compared to previous methods without sacrificing accuracy. The section concludes by describing how this tiling strategy is applied to both forward and backward passes.", "first_cons": "The multi-level tiling strategy, while effective, introduces complexity to the implementation, potentially increasing development time and making debugging more challenging.", "first_pros": "The tile-wise approach drastically reduces memory consumption, allowing for significantly larger batch sizes (e.g., from 128k to millions).", "keypoints": ["Tile-wise approach avoids full similarity matrix materialization, reducing memory complexity from O(b\u00b2) to O(b/n\u00b2)", "Numerically stable formulations (Equations 4 and 5) are used to prevent overflow during LSE calculation", "Multi-level tiling strategy combines cross-GPU and in-GPU tiling for optimal performance, leveraging asynchronous communication and fused kernels", "Achieves near linear memory scaling, enabling significantly larger batch sizes compared to previous methods (e.g., millions vs. 128k)"], "second_cons": "While theoretically supporting near-infinite batch sizes, the practical limit depends on tile size and available GPU resources.

The experiments used the Laion400M dataset (with 280M samples used for training), ViT-L/14 and ViT-B/16 model architectures, and the AdamW optimizer.  Data parallelism with automatic mixed precision was employed for distributed training.  The study compared Inf-CL against two baseline methods: vanilla CLIP loss and local OpenCLIP loss. Key performance metrics included peak memory usage, maximum achievable batch size, and training speed.  The results demonstrated that Inf-CL significantly reduces memory consumption compared to baselines, enabling the training of ViT-L/14 with a batch size of 4M on 8 A800 GPUs (80 GB each) and 12M on 32 A800 GPUs without sacrificing accuracy.
