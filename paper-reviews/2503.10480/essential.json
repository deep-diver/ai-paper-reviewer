Current methods often overlook learning to model the world to enhance planning. They either optimize action selection or leverage world models during inference. This limits their ability to perform in complex situations and they struggle with issues such as dependency constraints. \n\nThe paper introduces Dual Preference Optimization (D2PO), which jointly optimizes state prediction and action selection through preference learning. D2PO allows LVLMs to understand environment dynamics for better planning. It uses a tree search mechanism for exploration via trial-and-error to collect trajectories automatically. Experiments on VoTa-Bench show D2PO outperforms existing methods, achieving superior task success with efficient paths.
