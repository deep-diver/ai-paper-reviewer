Existing MIM approaches suffer from issues such as instability during training and poor representation quality when compared to other self-supervised methods. These limitations hinder the development of robust foundation models capable of excelling in various computer vision tasks.  \nThis paper introduces CAPI, a novel MIM framework that addresses these challenges. CAPI uses a clustering-based loss function that is more stable during training and leads to improved representation quality.  The method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets (ImageNet and ADE20K), significantly outperforming previous MIM methods while approaching the performance of the current top performer, DINOv2. The proposed approach offers a promising direction for future research in self-supervised learning and the development of powerful foundation models for computer vision.", "affiliation": "Meta FAIR", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.08769/podcast.wav"}
