Unlike typical knowledge distillation that happens post-training, PD applies knowledge transfer during the model's initial training.  Researchers systematically explored the design space of PD focusing on four aspects: logits processing (techniques to reduce memory usage during training), loss selection (the choice of function that measures how well the student model is learning), scaling law (how model size impacts the effect of PD), and the way logits (probability scores for words) from the teacher model are provided to the student model(offline or online). Experiments using GLM models show that PD effectively improves the student LLM's performance.  Interestingly, the study found that larger student models benefit more from PD, while the teacher model's size doesn't always guarantee better results. This highlights the importance of efficient use of computational resources in model development. They also found using logits from a teacher LLM trained simultaneously during pre-training (online) yields improvement but not as significant as offline, suggesting this approach saves on inference costs.  The study offers valuable insights into the design space of pre-training distillation for future LLM development, providing guidance on optimal configurations and helping researchers make informed decisions about resource allocation during the development process."}
