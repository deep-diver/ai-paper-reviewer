Unlike typical knowledge distillation applied after training, PD directly incorporates knowledge transfer during the initial training.  The researchers systematically explore the design space of PD by considering four key factors: logits processing, loss function selection, the scaling law between model sizes, and whether logits are generated offline (from a pre-trained teacher model) or online (simultaneously during teacher training). Experiments using the GLM language model showed that PD consistently improved student model performance compared to traditional pre-training methods.  They found that larger student models benefit more from PD and that efficient logit truncation methods are essential for handling the massive data involved.  They also found that a careful balance between distillation loss and standard language modeling loss is necessary for optimal results. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of PD and provides valuable insights into its design space, potentially informing future research in large language model training and optimization."}
