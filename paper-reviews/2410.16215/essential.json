Unlike traditional knowledge distillation focused on post-training, PD integrates the knowledge transfer directly into the initial model training.  The study systematically explores four key design aspects to optimize PD:  how to process the teacher's outputs (logits), which loss function to use, the relative sizes of the teacher and student LLMs, and whether to obtain the teacher's logits offline (from a pre-trained model) or online (during teacher training). Experiments show that PD improves performance, with larger student models generally benefiting more.  Offline logits tend to be more effective than online ones.  Specific optimal configurations of the design factors are identified, providing valuable practical guidance for researchers in the field.  The results suggest that PD is a promising method to enhance LLM training, and the paper's systematic exploration of its design space contributes significantly to future advancements in LLM optimization."}
