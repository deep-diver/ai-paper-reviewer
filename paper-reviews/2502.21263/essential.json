{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it **introduces RuCCoD, a novel dataset for ICD coding in Russian**, addressing a gap in resources for low-resource languages. It also offers insights into the **performance of various models, including LLMs, for automated clinical coding**, and demonstrates the potential for improved accuracy in diagnosis prediction using AI-guided coding.", "summary": "New dataset for automated ICD coding in Russian enhances clinical data accuracy.", "takeaways": ["Introduces RuCCoD, a new Russian dataset for ICD coding.", "Benchmarks state-of-the-art models, including BERT and LLaMA.", "Demonstrates improved diagnosis accuracy with automated ICD coding."], "tldr": "This study explores automating clinical coding in Russian, a language with limited biomedical resources. Existing research focuses on English datasets, leaving a gap in resources for other languages. Assigning ICD codes is crucial for medical documentation but poses challenges due to medical terminology, subjective interpretations, and changing classification standards. Errors in manual coding can lead to misdiagnosis and financial repercussions, highlighting the need for accurate and efficient coding methods.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper presents **RuCCoD, a new dataset for ICD coding in Russian**, labeled by medical professionals. It benchmarks models like BERT and LLaMA and examines transfer learning across domains. Experiments show that training with automatically predicted codes improves accuracy compared to manually annotated data. These findings highlight the potential for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages and enhancing clinical efficiency and data accuracy.", "affiliation": "AIRI, Moscow, Russia", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "2502.21263/podcast.wav"}
