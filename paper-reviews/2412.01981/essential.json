Existing methods for automatic annotation, such as Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), incur excessive computational overhead and produce noisy annotations, thereby limiting the scalability of PRMs.\nThis paper introduces a novel approach to efficiently train PRMs by utilizing readily available response-level labels. The core idea lies in parameterizing the reward function as a log-likelihood ratio of policy and reference models. The method is shown to implicitly learn a strong PRM using only this cheaper outcome data, eliminating the need for additional step-level annotations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines on a challenging mathematical reasoning task, with substantial improvements in data efficiency and training cost.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01981/podcast.wav"}
