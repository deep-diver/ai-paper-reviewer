{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on AI safety and multilingual NLP.  It **highlights significant safety inconsistencies across languages in state-of-the-art LLMs**, providing a strong impetus for the development of more robust multilingual safety benchmarks and fairer AI systems. The research also opens avenues for **exploring the intricate relationship between LLM size, instruction tuning, and cross-lingual safety performance.**", "summary": "M-ALERT, a new multilingual benchmark, reveals significant safety inconsistencies across languages in top LLMs.", "takeaways": ["State-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit significant safety inconsistencies across languages and categories.", "M-ALERT, a multilingual benchmark with 75,000 high-quality prompts in five languages, provides a comprehensive evaluation of LLM safety.", "Instruction tuning improves safety, but the correlation with model size is less pronounced than expected."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly being adopted globally, but ensuring their safety across various languages is crucial for equitable access and mitigating biases.  Current multilingual safety benchmarks are limited by their scope and lack of comprehensive cross-lingual coverage. This necessitates the development of robust multilingual safety evaluations. \nThis paper introduces M-ALERT, a new multilingual safety benchmark, to address these shortcomings.  M-ALERT evaluates LLMs in five languages (English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish) using 75,000 prompts.  The study's findings reveal substantial safety inconsistencies across languages and categories, highlighting the importance of language-specific safety analysis.  The researchers also evaluate instruction-tuned models, finding that instruction tuning improves safety but its correlation with model size isn't as strong as expected. **The results underscore the need for enhanced multilingual safety practices to ensure equitable and safe LLM usage across diverse communities.**", "affiliation": "TU Darmstadt", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.15035/podcast.wav"}
