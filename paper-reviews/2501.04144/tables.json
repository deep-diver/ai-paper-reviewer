The metrics used are DINO and CLIP similarity scores, and FID and FID-CLIP scores. Higher DINO and CLIP scores indicate better subject fidelity, while lower FID and FID-CLIP scores indicate better image quality and lower divergence from real images. The models compared are Textual Inversion, PartCraft, and Chirpy3D (the authors' model).", "section": "4. Experiment"}]
