The discussion is structured around the application of token reduction techniques for inference acceleration and KV cache compression.  Several methods are mentioned, such as Stream-LLM which reduces KV cache size by retaining only attention sinks and recent tokens; FastGen which employs an adaptive KV cache management;  H2O (Heavy-Hitter Oracle) which selectively prunes key-value pairs based on attention weights; and ScissorHands which identifies and retains tokens showing consistent attention patterns. These approaches primarily target text tokens in LLMs. In contrast,  FastV, the most relevant prior work for LVLMs, is discussed; this method reduces visual tokens in LVLMs by dropping them at the second layer during inference. However, the authors emphasize that these previous methods are not comprehensive and often suffer from limitations such as performance degradation due to information loss.

The authors' empirical study reveals that while image tokens are crucial in the shallow layers of the model, redundancy progressively increases in deeper layers. This observation forms the basis for their proposed strategy.\n\nPyramidDrop partitions the LVLM into several stages.  At the end of each stage, a portion of image tokens is dropped based on a pre-defined ratio (\u03bb).  This ratio determines how many tokens are removed at each stage, progressively reducing the number of tokens in deeper layers. The selection of which tokens to drop is guided by a lightweight attention mechanism, ranking tokens based on their similarity to the last instruction token. This ranking method is computationally inexpensive and allows the model to retain important image information.\n\nThe method's efficiency is further analyzed.  They demonstrate that the extra computational overhead from the ranking is minimal, especially when using FlashAttention.  The computational savings, due to reduced sequence length, are significantly larger, especially with a larger number of stages (S) and a smaller drop ratio (\u03bb).\n\nThe authors discuss experiments testing PyramidDrop with LLaVA-1.5 and LLaVA-NeXT, using several benchmarks including TextVQA.  The results showcase improvements in training speed (up to 40% faster), inference speed (up to 55% reduction in FLOPs), and high-resolution performance.  They also highlight that PyramidDrop can serve as a plug-and-play approach for inference acceleration without any retraining. They demonstrate that their attention-based token dropping selectively removes redundant tokens without losing crucial image information.

It begins by specifying the models used: LLaVA-1.5-Vicuna-7B and LLaVA-NeXT-Vicuna-7B, highlighting LLaVA-NeXT as a high-resolution extension supporting up to 2880 image tokens.  The experiments cover 14 benchmarks designed to assess different aspects of LVLM capabilities, including perception, reasoning, and high-resolution visual understanding.  Efficiency is evaluated in two ways: training time (reported in GPU hours) and inference FLOPs (floating point operations). The implementation details describe how the 32-layer LLM is divided into four stages, with image tokens dropped at the end of each stage according to a ratio (\u03bb).  The experiments analyze training time reduction, showing that LLaVA-NeXT achieves a 40% reduction (366 GPU hours to 218 GPU hours) with PyramidDrop, while LLaVA-1.5 shows a smaller improvement.  Inference acceleration is also explored, showing that PyramidDrop outperforms a comparable method (FastV) across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving a 3.5% improvement on DocVQA and a 1% improvement on TextVQA in the high-resolution benchmarks.
