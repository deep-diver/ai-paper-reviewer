This paper introduces PyramidDrop, a technique to improve efficiency. PyramidDrop identifies and removes redundant image tokens, specifically in the deeper layers of the model, where the redundancy is higher.  The method partitions the model into stages, progressively dropping tokens at the end of each stage based on a lightweight similarity calculation. Experiments show a 40% reduction in training time and a 55% reduction in inference FLOPs for LLaVA-NeXT, with comparable performance.  The method's simplicity allows it to be easily integrated into existing models for plug-and-play inference acceleration."}
