Combining different LLMs can improve performance, but methods like ensembling are costly. Explicit model fusion is adaptable, but can struggle with vocabulary alignment. This paper tackles the challenge of improving LLMs by implicitly combining strengths of different open-source LLMs into smaller models. \n\nThe study introduces FuseChat-3.0, a framework that leverages supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization to train target models. It leverages diverse datasets to improve instruction following, math, and coding. Evaluations show FuseChat-3.0 enhances performance, improving results across established benchmarks and creating state-of-the-art performance.
