It evaluates performance on two datasets, DAVIS-7 and UCF101-7, across seven generated frames using a range of metrics: PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio), SSIM (Structural Similarity Index), LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity), FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), and FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance).  The metrics assess both reconstruction quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and perceptual similarity (FID, FVD) of generated frames compared to ground truth.  Results are shown for Framer both with and without Co-Tracker (a point-tracking method) highlighting the performance improvement with the addition of this functionality.  Comparisons are made to methods categorized as both traditional (e.g., AMT, RIFE, FLAVR, FILM) and generative (e.g., LDMVFI, DynamicCrafter, SVDKFI) video interpolation approaches.", "section": "4.2 Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18978/tables/table_11_0.md", "caption": "Quantitative comparison with existing video interpolation methods on reconstruction and generative metrics, evaluated on all 7 generated frames.", "description": "The table presents a quantitative comparison of Framer with several existing video interpolation methods across various metrics, including PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, FID, and FVD.  The comparison is conducted on two datasets, DAVIS-7 and UCF101-7, evaluating the performance on all 7 generated frames.  The metrics assess both reconstruction quality (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and generative quality (FID, FVD). Framer is compared against both traditional flow-based and kernel-based methods, and also against more recent generative methods.  The results show that Framer outperforms the other methods across many of the metrics. A separate row is dedicated to Framer's performance when using the Co-Tracker for point trajectory estimation, further demonstrating performance improvements.", "section": "4.2 Comparison"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18978/tables/table_14_0.md", "caption": "Table 1: Quantitative comparison with existing video interpolation methods on reconstruction and generative metrics, evaluated on all 7 generated frames.", "description": "Table 1 presents a quantitative comparison of Framer with other video interpolation methods.
