It begins by highlighting the fundamental need for seamless and visually appealing transitions between frames in various applications like image morphing, slow-motion video generation, and cartoon interpolation.  The authors point out a critical limitation of traditional methods: their deterministic nature struggles with large motions or significant appearance changes, failing to align with user creativity or intent.  This deterministic behavior results from relying on optical flow or motion estimation, which can be inaccurate in complex scenarios.  Existing methods often lack the interactive capabilities to fine-tune the interpolation process according to user preferences.  The introduction emphasizes the core novelty of Framer: its interactive nature, achieved by allowing users to customize the transition process by manipulating the trajectories of selected keypoints. This design offers two primary advantages: fine-grained control over local motions and improved handling of challenging cases (where objects change significantly in shape or style between frames).  The section concludes by stating the introduction of an \"autopilot\" mode, which provides automatic keypoint estimation and trajectory refinement, thus simplifying the user experience.", "first_cons": "Traditional video frame interpolation methods often rely on estimating optical flow or motion to predict intermediate frames deterministically.

In VFI, the authors categorize existing methods into flow-based and kernel-based approaches, highlighting limitations such as inaccurate flow estimation and kernel size constraints.  They discuss the emergence of generative approaches using large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models, noting advantages in perceptual quality but also the lack of controllability and difficulties in handling significant differences between frames.  The section then delves into the characteristics of Video Diffusion Models.  These models, it states, have demonstrated high visual quality and diversity, although early explorations often lacked precision and interactiveness in controlling the video generation process.  The authors mention that some efforts incorporate additional controls, such as structural controls (sketches and depth maps), but these are often difficult to obtain and limit practical use.  In contrast, newer studies focus on more intuitive control signals, like motion and camera pose, which can be easily obtained via user interaction.  The section concludes by positioning the proposed Framer method in the context of these previous works, emphasizing the need for both visual quality and user-controllable frame interpolation.", "first_cons": "Existing flow-based and kernel-based VFI methods struggle with large motions or significant changes in object appearance, leading to inaccurate results.

The core of the method involves fine-tuning this pre-trained model to perform video frame interpolation, specifically focusing on adding frame conditions and a trajectory controlling branch.  The frame conditioning process involves incorporating start and end frame conditions into both the latent and semantic spaces of the model. The trajectory control branch is added separately, allowing for interactive control through customized point trajectories.  This branch uses a point trajectory-based control mechanism similar to ControlNet. For an 'autopilot' mode, a novel bidirectional point-tracking method automatically estimates keypoint trajectories.  This method uses feature matching and nearest-neighbor searching to estimate trajectories, ensuring temporal coherence.
