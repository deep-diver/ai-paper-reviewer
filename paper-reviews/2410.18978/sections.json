Framer allows users to customize transitions by adjusting trajectories of selected keypoints, offering fine-grained control over local motions and addressing challenges posed by objects changing shape or style between frames.

While significant progress has been made, these approaches struggle in scenarios involving large motion or substantial changes in object appearance, due to inaccurate flow estimation. \n- Recently, inspired by the generative capacity of large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models, some methods attempt to tackle VFI from a generation perspective. Though progress has been made, these methods still have difficulties in tackling large differences between the starting and ending frames. Moreover, they focus on generating a single deterministic solution for video frame interpolation, without controllability.  \n- Large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models have shown unprecedented generation results in visual quality, diversity, and realism. These methods leverage text or starting image controls, which are often insufficient in precision and interactiveness. Some works attempt to add additional controls to video diffusion models, utilizing structural controls or motion controls. However, these control signals are often difficult to obtain, limiting their practical applications.

Recent generative approaches using video diffusion models offer improved visual quality but still face challenges in handling large frame differences and lack user control. While some works incorporate additional control signals like motion trajectories, these are often difficult to obtain.  The review highlights the need for more flexible and controllable methods that allow for interactive user guidance during video frame interpolation.  Overall, the field is moving toward generative approaches that allow for more controllability and interactive manipulation of video frames but still has some challenges in achieving the highest level of user controllability and flexibility for varied video content scenarios.
