Unlike traditional methods that deterministically generate frames based on input images, Framer lets users influence the transition by manipulating keypoints. This is achieved using a pre-trained video diffusion model which is fine-tuned using both the input images and user defined keypoint trajectories to produce the final interpolation.  The system offers both an interactive mode where users directly manipulate keypoints and an \"autopilot\" mode where the system automatically estimates keypoints and trajectories.  Extensive experiments show Framer surpasses existing techniques across applications like image morphing, time-lapse video generation, and cartoon interpolation, producing smoother and more realistic transitions."}
