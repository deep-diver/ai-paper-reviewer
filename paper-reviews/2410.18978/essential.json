Unlike traditional methods that deterministically generate frames, FRAMER allows users to customize the interpolation process by manually adjusting the trajectories of selected keypoints. This interactive approach enables finer control over local motions and addresses the ambiguity inherent in image-to-image transformations.  Furthermore, FRAMER incorporates an \"autopilot\" mode that automatically estimates and refines keypoint trajectories, simplifying the usage for those who prefer a less hands-on approach. The model is trained on a large-scale video dataset and is shown to produce high-quality results across diverse applications such as image morphing, time-lapse video generation, and cartoon interpolation, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in many challenging cases. The authors provide the code, model, and interface for further research."}
