The x-axis represents the 3D-UNet decoder feature index used for point tracking, indicating different levels of feature abstraction. The y-axis displays two metrics: FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance) and FVD (Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance), both assessing the quality of the generated videos. Two lines are presented, one red for FID and one blue for FVD, each showing how the metric values change across different feature indices. The graph allows to assess the impact of the choice of feature index on the overall performance of the model, indicating which feature level yields the best results in terms of FID and FVD scores.", "section": "B MORE DETAILED ABLATION RESULTS"}, {"figure_path": "2410.18978/charts/charts_15_1.png", "caption": "Figure S1: Ablations on diffusion feature for point tracking at test time, experiments conducted on DAVIS-7 (left) and UCF101-7 (right).", "description": "The chart displays the impact of using different 3D-UNet decoder feature indices for point tracking on FID and FVD metrics for video interpolation using two datasets, DAVIS-7 and UCF101-7.
