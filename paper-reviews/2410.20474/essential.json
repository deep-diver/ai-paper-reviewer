They typically rely on noisy image updates via backpropagation from custom loss functions, resulting in imprecise control.  This limits the flexibility and precision of user-guided image generation.\n\nThis paper introduces GROUNDIT, a novel training-free technique that utilizes the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers. GROUNDIT employs a two-stage approach: global update for initial refinement and local update for fine-grained control. The core innovation is a **noisy patch transplantation mechanism** which cultivates and transplants denoised patches into designated bounding box regions. This approach enables robust spatial grounding, achieving **state-of-the-art performance** on benchmark datasets, particularly when handling complex scenarios with multiple or small bounding boxes."}
