To overcome the challenge of limited high-quality multilingual multimodal data, three main strategies were employed: 1) high-quality English instructions were translated into multiple languages, carefully filtering for culturally relevant images; 2) culturally relevant instructions were generated; and 3) existing open-source multimodal datasets were repurposed.  The dataset includes various instruction types such as general instructions, document and chart question answering, captioning, and domain-specific instructions, and spans 39 languages. A detailed pipeline is described to address Western-centric biases in visual representations.  This involved sourcing images from LAION-Multi, which was subsequently filtered using an LLM to ensure cultural relevance, generating detailed descriptions and complex instructions, and employing machine translation with the Gemini 1.5 Pro model to produce the multilingual datasets. A post-processing pipeline was developed to address inconsistencies and errors in the translations. The resulting PANGEAINS dataset offers significant linguistic and cultural diversity and aims to bridge the linguistic and cultural gaps in visual understanding tasks.", "first_cons": "The reliance on machine translation, even with a high-quality model like Gemini 1.5 Pro, introduces limitations.  The authors acknowledge that machine translation struggles with complex instruction-following scenarios, and that inconsistencies arose despite post-processing. This may result in a dataset that does not perfectly reflect nuanced linguistic and cultural expressions, potentially biasing the resulting model.", "first_pros": "The innovative approach of combining machine translation with meticulous curation and post-processing resulted in a high-quality, large-scale dataset (6 million samples) for instruction tuning.

While the authors mention employing an LLM to filter images based on cultural informativeness and generating culturally-aware instructions, the extent to which these steps successfully mitigated Western-centric biases remains unclear.  More rigorous evaluation of the cultural appropriateness of the instructions is needed.", "second_pros": "The multi-pronged approach to data generation ensures a richer and more balanced dataset, combining machine-translated instructions with original culturally relevant instructions.
