While MLLMs have shown impressive capabilities in various tasks, their development has predominantly focused on English and Western-centric datasets and benchmarks. This results in underrepresentation of the world's languages and cultural contexts, leading to diminished performance in multilingual settings, outputs misaligned with the socio-cultural norms of underrepresented languages, and difficulties in recognizing objects from geographically diverse regions. The authors emphasize the urgent need for multilingual MLLMs that can serve a diverse set of users equitably.  The paper introduces four key challenges: 1) data scarcity; 2) cultural nuances; 3) catastrophic forgetting; 4) evaluation complexity.  These are addressed by the introduction of PANGEA, a fully open multilingual multimodal LLM trained on PANGEAINS, a diverse instruction dataset, and evaluated on PANGEABENCH, a holistic evaluation suite.

Addressing the scarcity of high-quality multilingual data, it employs three main strategies: 1) high-quality English instructions are translated into multiple languages, ensuring cultural relevance through image filtering; 2) culturally aware instructions are generated, 3) existing open-source multimodal datasets are repurposed.  The dataset incorporates various instruction types, including general instructions, document and chart question answering, captioning, domain-specific tasks, and culturally relevant questions, to promote cross-cultural coverage. To mitigate Western-centric biases, images are sourced from LAION-Multi, followed by a filtering pipeline that leverages an LLM to score and filter images for cultural informativeness.   The dataset's distribution shows a 40/60 split between English and multilingual instructions, indicating the important role of English data in cross-lingual transfer.  Three key strategies are implemented to address multilingual multimodal learning hurdles: machine translation of high-quality English instructions, filtering images and generating instructions for multicultural understanding, and curating existing multilingual instructions from open-source datasets. A pipeline uses an LLM to generate detailed descriptions, create complex instructions, and filter images, improving cultural understanding while maintaining multilingual performance.

The benchmark is structured into five multimodal tasks (Multimodal Chat, Captioning, Cultural Understanding, Multilingual Visual Question Answering, and Multi-Subject Reasoning) and three text-only tasks (QA, Translation, and Reasoning).  The multimodal tasks leverage both existing and newly curated datasets like xChatBench and xMMMU, which were specifically designed to evaluate open-ended, information-seeking multimodal conversations and college-level multimodal reasoning across several languages. The results reveal significant performance differences across models, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to MLLM development, and emphasizing the importance of addressing cross-lingual and cross-cultural challenges in model training and evaluation.

Qualitative examples from the multimodal chat benchmark (xChatBench) are provided, along with an exploration of the challenges in multilingual OCR.  The scaling effect of instruction quantity reveals a consistent positive correlation between the number of multilingual instructions and model performance in both English and multilingual settings. In terms of the role of English data, the study shows that a balance (40% English and 60% multilingual data) is crucial to achieving optimal performance.  Over-reliance on English data harms multilingual performance.  Qualitative examples highlight the model's ability to interpret and respond to varied instructions but also reveal limitations in handling complex scenarios.

Ablation studies further demonstrate the effectiveness of the chosen training methodology. Preliminary findings on multilingual OCR are also discussed, highlighting the need for increased training data and further development in this area for non-Latin scripts. The overall conclusion suggests that inclusive and robust multilingual multi-modal large language models can be successfully trained, given the right dataset design and training methodology but further investigation into the model's limitations is needed.  The results reveal nuanced relationships between data size, English data proportion, and multilingual capabilities, along with both the promise and challenges in improving multilingual OCR performance.  High-quality multilingual multimodal instruction data is needed to address issues of data scarcity, cultural bias, and evaluation complexity inherent to training these types of large language models (LLMs). This can help to promote equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.  More comprehensive evaluation methods are also needed to measure cultural understanding effectively and reduce bias in LLM training and evaluation.  Further research into these topics is recommended.  This discussion section provides crucial insights into the methodology used and potential areas of future research.  More robust techniques for multilingual OCR are also critical for enhancing the capabilities of multilingual LLMs, especially for low-resource languages.  It also emphasizes the importance of careful data selection and a balanced approach to data generation in order to avoid biases in training data and to enhance model performance and cultural inclusivity.  More detailed studies and rigorous analysis are needed to enhance multilingual OCR performance further and to address the challenges associated with developing truly inclusive and robust multilingual LLMs.  This is crucial for ensuring that the benefits of this technology are equitably shared across the global community and to avoiding biases and inaccuracies that could have detrimental impacts on different groups of users around the world.  Addressing these issues would create more inclusive and equitable technologies. Future work needs to focus on creating more diverse and comprehensive data sets with broader cultural and linguistic coverage. More efficient and accurate evaluation methods are also needed to measure cultural understanding effectively in these models.  These are crucial for ensuring that the technology is accessible and beneficial to individuals from all language groups and to reduce cultural biases in multilingual LLMs.   These improvements are needed to enhance equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum.  Future research should investigate more sophisticated multilingual evaluation techniques for MLLMs to obtain better metrics and avoid bias in evaluations.  Moreover, research into improved techniques for multilingual OCR is crucial for enhancing the capabilities of multimodal LLMs across many different languages. More research and experimentation are needed to better understand the effects of English data proportions on multilingual performance, and improved training methods should be developed to better handle low-resource languages.  It is essential to promote equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum through improved evaluation metrics and methodologies, and further research into these topics is strongly recommended.  These findings will impact the development of future multilingual LLMs, making them more capable and culturally inclusive. This will result in more equitable and accessible technology across language groups. Future studies are needed to fully address the nuances of creating culturally inclusive multilingual LLMs and improve evaluation methods.  This paper concludes by recommending further research into improving multilingual OCR techniques and training data sets, and further developing more sophisticated evaluation strategies for multimodal LLMs.   Addressing these challenges is essential for creating truly inclusive and equitable LLMs that effectively serve users worldwide.  Open-sourcing data, code and models in this study will allow for the development of more robust and inclusive multilingual LLMs in the future, enhancing equity and accessibility across a broader linguistic and cultural spectrum."}}]
