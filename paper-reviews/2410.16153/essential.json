Unlike previous models primarily focused on English and Western data, PANGEA leverages a 6-million instruction dataset (PANGEAINS) to achieve significantly better performance across a wide range of languages and tasks, proving superior capabilities in multilingual settings.  Its creators also introduced PANGEABENCH, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering 14 datasets and 47 languages to benchmark these models\u2019 capabilities, showing PANGEA to be significantly better than comparable open-source models.  Finally, to promote wider adoption and further research, the researchers fully open-sourced all their data, code, and trained model checkpoints.  This work pushes forward the boundaries of LLM development towards a more inclusive and globally representative model."}
