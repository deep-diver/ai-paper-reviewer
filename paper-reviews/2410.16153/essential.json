Unlike previous models primarily focused on English and Western contexts, PANGEA excels in handling 39 diverse languages and their associated cultural nuances.  Its training utilized PANGEAINS, a massive 6-million-instruction dataset, ensuring high-quality English instructions and careful machine translations.  Performance was rigorously evaluated on PANGEABENCH, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering 14 datasets across 47 languages.  PANGEA's results demonstrated significantly better performance than current open-source models in multilingual settings, especially when considering cross-cultural contexts. The researchers highlight the significance of balanced English data representation and the number of multimodal training samples, impacting performance.  Crucially, the entire project\u2014data, code, and model\u2014is open-sourced to promote equity and accessibility in multilingual AI development."}
