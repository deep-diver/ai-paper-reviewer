It contains over 7 million training examples covering 133 different tasks, making it the largest and most comprehensive biomedical instruction dataset available. The researchers also created a benchmark dataset, called MEDINST32, which uses a subset of MedINST's data to test how well LLMs can generalize from one task to another. They found that fine-tuning LLMs on MedINST significantly improved their performance on MEDINST32, demonstrating the benefits of using this large, diverse dataset. This research is crucial for developing more effective LLMs for biomedical applications, as it addresses the limitations of smaller, task-specific datasets. The availability of MedINST and MEDINST32 will undoubtedly help advance research in biomedical natural language processing."}
