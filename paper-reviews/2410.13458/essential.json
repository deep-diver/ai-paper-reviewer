This makes it the largest biomedical instruction dataset available. The researchers used this dataset to create a challenging benchmark, MedINST32, which they used to test the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new, unseen tasks. They found that fine-tuning LLMs on MedINST significantly improved their performance and ability to generalize across different tasks within the biomedical domain.  The findings highlight the importance of large, well-annotated datasets for training robust and adaptable LLMs in the complex field of medical analysis. The study also emphasizes that instruction fine-tuning is a more effective strategy than pre-training alone for adapting LLMs to the biomedical field.  The MedINST dataset and the MedINST32 benchmark are publicly available, allowing other researchers to further explore these findings and contribute to the advancement of biomedical NLP."}
