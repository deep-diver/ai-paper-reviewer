{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it **systematically analyzes API-based and GUI-based LLM agents**, offering clear decision criteria for selecting the right approach. It **bridges the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application**, guiding future research and development in LLM-driven automation and human-computer interaction, and addressing the evolving needs in software ecosystems.", "summary": "API vs. GUI Agents: Understanding the divergence and convergence in LLM-based automation.", "takeaways": ["API-based agents offer efficiency, security, and reliability due to well-defined endpoints.", "GUI-based agents provide broad applicability and user-like workflows, enhancing user experience.", "Hybrid approaches combine the strengths of both paradigms, enabling more comprehensive and adaptive automation solutions."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are used in software agents, and this leads to two distinct paradigms: API-based and GUI-based agents. API-based agents use direct connections and GUI-based agents interact like humans. While both help with automation, their designs, development, and user interactions vary significantly. This paper shows the key differences and looks at how they might come together in the future.\n\nThis paper offers the first complete study comparing these two types of LLM agents. It looks at their differences and convergence, focusing on important aspects and hybrid solutions. It provides guidelines and real-world examples to help researchers and developers choose, combine, or switch between these designs. The goal is to help create more flexible and adaptable solutions in real-world situations.", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2503.11069/podcast.wav"}
