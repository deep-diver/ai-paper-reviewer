The metrics used are FID (Frechet Inception Distance), FVD (Frechet Video Distance), and ObjMC (Object Motion Control). Lower scores are better for all three metrics.  The results show that the proposed zero-shot method (SG-I2V) achieves competitive motion fidelity to the supervised methods, which required extensive fine-tuning, while maintaining comparable or better visual quality (FID and FVD).  In addition, the zero-shot method significantly outperforms other zero-shot baselines.", "section": "4 Experiments"}]
