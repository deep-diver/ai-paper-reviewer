Current methods either struggle with accuracy, especially when dealing with multiple objects, or are too slow and complex.  Many approaches rely on reconstructing scenes from existing 3D models which hinders creativity and limits the ability to generate novel scenes. This makes producing natural-looking, composite 3D scenes from a single input picture very hard.\n\nThe researchers present MIDI, a new method that tackles this problem.  **MIDI uses multi-instance diffusion models, which means it can generate many 3D objects simultaneously**. This is done by leveraging pre-trained object generation models and adding a new attention mechanism that helps the model understand how different objects relate to each other in space.  **Experiments show that MIDI outperforms existing methods, creating high-quality 3D scenes efficiently and exhibiting strong generalization across different types of input images.** This opens up exciting possibilities in 3D scene generation and computer vision.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.03558/podcast.wav"}
