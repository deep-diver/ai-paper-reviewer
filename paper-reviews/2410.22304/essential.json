Existing methods often rely on expensive human annotations or lack the granularity to capture the nuances of mathematical problem-solving. \n\nFlow-DPO offers a solution by employing an incremental output production flow with two collaborative LLMs: an Answer LLM generating solution chunks and a Stop LLM determining completion. This flow is trained using online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with rollouts, creating high-quality reasoning traces for fine-tuning. **This approach significantly improves LLM performance, is cost-effective, and provides better flexibility than previous methods.**"}
