Existing methods often rely on expensive human annotations or produce insufficiently informative traces. \n\nFlow-DPO tackles this by using an innovative online multi-agent learning system.  Multiple LLMs collaborate to iteratively build solutions, trained in real-time using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with rollouts. This method produces superior reasoning traces compared to traditional approaches, enhancing LLM performance and opening new avenues for LLM self-improvement and fine-tuning."}
