Human-generated traces are expensive and often insufficient, while simply using model-generated traces leads to subpar performance.  This paper tackles this problem by focusing on generating better reasoning traces. \nThe proposed solution, Flow-DPO, uses an online multi-agent learning approach.  Multiple LLMs work together iteratively to build a solution, with their performance constantly improved through online DPO learning and rollouts.  This method outperforms existing single-model approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of collaborative learning for generating high-quality reasoning traces and consequently improving LLMs' mathematical reasoning abilities.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
