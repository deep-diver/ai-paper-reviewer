However, existing methods face challenges due to the conciseness or disorganization of human-generated reasoning steps and the high cost of human annotation. The need for generating high-quality reasoning traces for LLM self-improvement is highlighted, especially for advancing frontier models and reducing the costs associated with large, closed-source models. Previous work has primarily focused on collecting accurate traces through inference and filtering, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or direct preference optimization (DPO).  Rejection sampling fine-tuning (RFT) is mentioned as a common approach that uses outcome rewards based on the final answer. There's also discussion of process reward, which focuses on generating superior traces by treating reasoning steps leading to correct answers as preferred.  The need for efficient and effective methods to generate high-quality traces for LLM fine-tuning is emphasized.", "first_cons": "Challenges in generating detailed and accurate reasoning traces remain a significant hurdle for improving LLM mathematical reasoning capabilities.
