Current approaches often rely on filtering model-generated traces or using human annotations, both of which are expensive and/or produce suboptimal results. The abundance of datasets with mathematical questions and answers makes this a particularly important area to improve.  Current efforts either focus on outcome reward (final answer correctness), which provides limited feedback, or try to approximate process reward by assuming that traces leading to correct answers are good. The ideal solution involves directly training the model to generate high-quality reasoning traces through online learning.
