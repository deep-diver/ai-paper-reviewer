{"importance": "This survey is important for researchers to **navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM agents**. It provides a **structured taxonomy for understanding agent architectures**, identifies **key challenges**, and **suggests directions for future research**. The survey could inspire researchers to **develop more robust, reliable, and ethically aligned agent systems**.", "summary": "This survey presents a methodology-centered taxonomy of LLM agent systems, linking design principles to emergent behaviors and identifying future research directions.", "takeaways": ["LLM agents represent a critical pathway toward artificial general intelligence, exhibiting goal-driven behaviors and dynamic adaptation.", "The survey systematically deconstructs LLM agent systems through three interconnected dimensions: construction, collaboration, and evolution.", "The research identifies emerging patterns and offers a structured taxonomy for understanding LLM agents, facilitating future research."], "tldr": "**LLM agents**, powered by large language models, are intelligent entities that can perceive environments, reason about goals, and execute actions. Unlike traditional AI, they actively engage through continuous learning & adaptation, marking a technological leap & reimagining human-machine relationships. However, challenges remain to construct high-quality multi-agent system. Therefore, existing research can be fragmented and lack of organized taxonomy, while others examine components separately. \nTo address these challenges, this survey systematically deconstructs **LLM agent systems** through construction, collaboration, and evolution. It offers a comprehensive perspective on how agents are built, interact, and evolve, while addressing evaluation, tools, real-world challenges, and applications. The study highlights fundamental connections between agent design principles and emergent behaviors, providing a unified architectural view and identifying promising research directions. The collection is available in github.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21460/podcast.wav"}
