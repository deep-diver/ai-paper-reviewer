This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel evaluation metric, 'manipulation centricity', which quantifies how well a representation focuses on task-relevant aspects.  Low manipulation centricity correlates with poor performance in downstream tasks.\n\nTo overcome these limitations, the authors propose Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR), a pre-training method that leverages a large-scale robot dataset (DROID) and incorporates dynamic information like robot states and actions.  **MCR significantly improves manipulation centricity and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in various simulations and real-world robotic manipulation tasks.**  The results highlight the importance of using robot-specific data and dynamics for improving robotic representations."}
