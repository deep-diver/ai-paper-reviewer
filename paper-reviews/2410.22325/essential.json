This leads to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. **The paper addresses this by introducing a new evaluation metric, \"manipulation centricity,\" to better assess robotic representation quality.**\n\nTo improve performance, the authors propose a novel pre-training method, Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR).  **MCR uses a large-scale robotic dataset (DROID) and incorporates robot dynamics information into its training process, specifically via new \"dynamics alignment\" and \"action prediction\" loss functions, along with a time contrastive loss.**  This results in a significant performance boost across various simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach and the importance of leveraging robot-specific data."}
