This paper addresses this limitation by introducing a new evaluation metric, \"manipulation centricity,\" which quantifies how well a representation focuses on manipulation-relevant parts of a scene (e.g., robot end-effectors, objects).  Experiments show a strong positive correlation between this metric and downstream robotic task performance. \nTo improve manipulation centricity, the authors propose a novel pre-training method called Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR). MCR utilizes a large-scale robot dataset and incorporates three training objectives: dynamics alignment, action prediction, and temporal contrast.  Results across various simulation and real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that MCR significantly outperforms existing methods, highlighting the benefits of using large-scale robot data and incorporating dynamics into the representation learning process.  MCR's superior performance suggests a more effective approach for pre-training robotic visual representations.", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}}
