We introduce a robotic representation evaluation metric termed manipulation centricity, which exhibits a strong correlation with downstream policy performance. Accordingly, we design a new pre-training method, MCR, to learn manipulation-centric representation from large-scale robotic datasets. Comprehensive experiments on both simulations and real robot validate the superiority of our proposed representation.", "description": "The figure illustrates the overall framework of the proposed Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR) method, showing the pre-training process using large-scale robotic datasets and its evaluation on both simulation and real robot tasks.", "section": "1 INTRODUCTION"}]
