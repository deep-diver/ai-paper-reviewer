Prior works leverage human videos, but this introduces **distribution shifts** and lacks crucial **dynamic information** vital for robotic tasks. The paper highlights the critical need for evaluation metrics that directly correlate with downstream task performance. This leads to the introduction of a new evaluation metric: **manipulation centricity**, which measures the correlation between the representation's focus and manipulation-relevant image regions (e.g., robot end-effectors and task objects).  A strong positive correlation between manipulation centricity and downstream performance is observed.
