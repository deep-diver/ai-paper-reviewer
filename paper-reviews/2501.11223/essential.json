This creates a divide between institutions with access to advanced AI and those without. Current RLMs uniquely combine Reinforcement Learning (RL), search heuristics, and Large Language Models (LLMs), making them difficult to understand and reproduce.\nTo address these issues, this paper proposes a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework.  This framework includes various reasoning structures, strategies, RL concepts, and supervision schemes.  The authors provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation, demonstrating the blueprint's versatility by showing how existing RLMs fit as special cases.  They also introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation, and use it to provide key insights, like multi-phase training strategies.  The goal is to democratize RLM construction and lower barriers to entry, fostering innovation and mitigating the gap between \"rich AI\" and \"poor AI\".", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.11223/podcast.wav"}
