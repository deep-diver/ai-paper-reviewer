This paper introduces MMed-RAG, a new system designed to enhance Med-LVM factuality.  MMed-RAG uses three key innovations: 1) A domain-aware retrieval mechanism that adapts to different medical domains (e.g., radiology, ophthalmology); 2) An adaptive method to select only the most relevant retrieved information; and 3) A preference-based fine-tuning strategy to improve the alignment between the model's output and ground truth.  Experiments across five diverse medical datasets show that MMed-RAG significantly improves the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs (a 43.8% average improvement), outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. The system is versatile, works well across various medical domains, and addresses key misalignment issues. The code and data are publicly available."}
