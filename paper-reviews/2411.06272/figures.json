FinLLMs receive structured instructions and various input data (e.g., financial news articles, stock data, etc.) as input. They process this input to generate precise outputs, such as sentiment analysis results, summaries, stock price predictions, or answers to financial analyst-level questions. The diagram visually represents the input-processing-output pipeline of a FinLLM, highlighting its ability to handle complex financial information and produce tailored results.", "section": "1.

We organized the collected high-quality datasets along these axes.", "description": "Figure 2 presents a comprehensive overview of the Golden Touchstone benchmark's organization.  It visually depicts how the benchmark's 22 datasets are categorized across eight core financial NLP tasks. The categorization uses two dimensions: the type of NLP task (Natural Language Understanding or Natural Language Generation) and the language (English or Chinese). This clear visual representation allows for easy comprehension of the benchmark's structure and the diversity of tasks and languages covered.", "section": "3.

It uses radar charts to visualize the average performance of each model across eight different financial NLP tasks, broken down by English and Chinese language datasets. The chart allows for a direct comparison of model strengths and weaknesses in specific tasks and across different languages, highlighting the relative performance of general-purpose LLMs versus those specifically trained for financial applications.", "section": "4.2 Evaluation Results"}]
