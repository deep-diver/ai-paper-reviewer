This paper addresses this limitation. Current methods generate images token by token, a process that is inherently slow.  Also, prior attempts at parallel generation often sacrifice image quality or require complex model modifications. \nThis work introduces a novel approach that **parallelizes the image generation process by identifying and generating weakly dependent tokens in parallel**, while maintaining sequential generation for strongly dependent tokens. The method is simple to implement, requiring no changes to model architecture or tokenizer.  Experimental results demonstrate impressive speedups (3.6x-9.5x) with minimal quality loss on ImageNet and UCF-101 datasets, showcasing the practicality of the proposed method.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.15119/podcast.wav"}
