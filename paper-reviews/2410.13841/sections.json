This categorization forms the core framework for analyzing different techniques later. The section then introduces a unified view of delta parameter editing using the Riemann sum approximation of the loss function.  This framework allows for a mathematical analysis of how different editing operations affect the model's loss, providing a theoretical basis for understanding their performance.  Equation (1) provides the core formula for this analysis, expressing the loss difference (\u0394C) as a Riemann sum that relates loss changes to the editing operation (\u0394W).

It uses DARE (and its successor DELLA-Merging) as a prime example, showing how these methods achieve this competitive performance.  The core idea is to mathematically analyze the impact of these methods on model performance using the Riemann sum approximation of the loss function.  DARE achieves near-zero loss difference by using a random drop and rescale process, effectively eliminating a significant portion of delta parameters (90% or even 99%) without hurting performance. The analysis reveals that maintaining the Riemann sum approximation term at zero is key, and that achieving this does not require the random drop itself, rather the randomness of the element-wise product of delta parameters and approximation term is a sufficient and necessary condition. The section expands on this by introducing a broader and more general formula (extension of DARE) that includes a factor k for handling dropped parameters and the rescaling, showing flexibility in DARE implementation.\n\nThe section also includes experimental validation results, showing that the revised DARE maintains competitive performance across multiple tasks. The results on the GSM8K dataset demonstrate a close approximation to zero loss, corroborating the theoretical analysis.  Figure 1 visually shows the performance of LLaMA3-8B-Instruct on several tasks (GSM8K, TruthfulQA, HumanEval) and Figure 2 shows similar results using ViT-B-32 on different visual tasks. The performance curves demonstrate that, with the extension of DARE,  the model performance is nearly identical to the original post-trained model across a wide range of drop rates (p) and k values.  This validates the theoretical analysis and the extension of DARE. The analysis further challenges the assumption that the exact sign of the delta parameters matters greatly for model performance.\n\nThe paper also touches on the idea of whether random selection of delta parameters for deletion in DARE is actually a necessary or sufficient requirement.  By using a biased approach (instead of the random selection) of applying the k factor to negative and positive delta parameters, they confirm that random selection is sufficient but not necessary, while the randomness of the product of delta parameters and the gradient terms in the loss function approximation seems to be more important.

It uses the Riemann sum approximation of the loss function to theoretically analyze the effectiveness of DARE (and its extension) by showing that maintaining near-zero loss difference is critical.  DARE achieves this by randomly dropping and rescaling a large percentage (90%-99%) of delta parameters.  The analysis is experimentally validated by showing that the proposed extension of DARE consistently maintains high performance, even when using a biased selection of parameters to remove, instead of completely random selection. This suggests that the randomness of the element-wise product of delta parameters and gradient is more important than random dropping for maintaining the model performance.
