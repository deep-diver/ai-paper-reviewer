Leveraging PCA, we compute the eigenvalues, which serve as weights to prioritize columns in the weight matrix for error approximation. By adopting EoRA, users can achieve significantly better compensated compressed LLMs in just a few minutes, requiring only a small amount of calibration data.", "description": "The figure illustrates the EORA method's workflow, showing how compression errors are projected into the eigenspace of input activations, eigenvalues are used as weights to prioritize error components, and SVD is applied to derive low-rank residual paths to compensate for compression errors.", "section": "1.
