Existing methods either compromise accuracy or lack flexibility in handling diverse compression formats. This paper introduces the training-free Eigenspace Low-Rank Approximation (EoRA) method to address these issues. \n\nEoRA projects compression errors into the eigenspace of input activations, prioritizing high-importance error components for reconstruction.  It effectively minimizes compression errors without gradient-based training. Experiments demonstrate EoRA's superior performance compared to existing methods on various tasks (language generation, commonsense reasoning, and math reasoning) and its robustness to quantization and different sparsity levels. **EoRA provides a scalable, training-free solution to compensate for compression errors, significantly enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of LLM deployment.**"}
