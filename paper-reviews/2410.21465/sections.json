The low-rank pre-RoPE keys allow for significant memory savings by storing only their low-rank projections on the GPU. The value cache is offloaded to the CPU, minimizing GPU memory consumption.  During decoding, SHADOWKV employs an accurate KV selection strategy using landmarks and outliers to minimize decoding latency.  Pre-filling involves SVD on pre-RoPE keys, offloading values, and identifying outliers which are cached alongside landmarks for efficient key recovery.  Decoding involves a fast KV selection process via landmarks and outliers. Multi-streaming overlaps key recovery and value fetching to improve throughput.  The system's high-throughput is achieved by offloading the value cache and using a low-rank representation of the key cache on the GPU, complemented by a fast, accurate KV selection during decoding.
