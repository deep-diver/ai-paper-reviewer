The **low-rank key cache**, **landmarks**, and **outliers** are stored on the GPU while the value cache is offloaded to the CPU, thus minimizing the memory footprint. In the **decoding phase**, it uses landmarks to select important KV pairs, fetches the corresponding value cache from the CPU, reconstructs the low-rank key cache, and performs sparse attention, minimizing latency and maintaining accuracy.
