However, the key-value (KV) cache, storing previous key-value activations to avoid re-computation, scales with sequence length, causing growing memory footprint and access time for each token generation, which leads to low throughput. Existing solutions like KV cache eviction or sparse attention methods have limitations: accuracy degradation, insufficient memory reduction, and significant decoding latency.

This low-rank property allows for significant compression of the key cache without sacrificing accuracy.  The second observation is that **post-ROPE keys exhibit high cosine similarity with adjacent tokens**, except for a few outliers.
