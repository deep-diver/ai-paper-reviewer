Autoregressive models, while offering a theoretically unified framework for vision and language, often lag behind diffusion models in both speed and visual quality.  Existing scale-wise models, while promising, exhibit convergence issues and suboptimal performance.  \nThis paper introduces SWITTI, a novel scale-wise transformer designed to overcome these limitations.  The researchers improved model stability and convergence through architectural modifications.  By analyzing self-attention maps, they discovered a weak dependence on preceding scales in the pretrained model, leading to a non-autoregressive version (SWITTI) that improves speed and image quality. Further optimizations involved disabling classifier-free guidance at high-resolution scales.  Extensive evaluation, including human preference studies, demonstrated SWITTI's superior performance and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models.", "affiliation": "Yandex Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01819/podcast.wav"}
