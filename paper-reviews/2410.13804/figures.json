[{"figure_path": "2410.13804/figures/figures_1_0.png", "caption": "Figure 1: LEFT: In-context Transferability (ICT) reveals the clusters of benchmark tasks. We apply spectral clustering to ICT (arcs\u00b9) between MMLU tasks (nodes), whose color denotes the cluster it belongs to. The discovered clusters are associated with explainable themes. The theme and tasks of each cluster are listed around the chord graph. Only the top-7% arcs with the highest ICT values are shown in the graph, among which intra-cluster arcs are much more than inter-cluster arcs, implying a \"sparse\" topology captured by ICT. RIGHT: Evaluation accuracy of task reduction methods. Each method selects 3 out of the 57 tasks in MMLU to evaluate 9 LLMs (axes). The plot reports 1 \u2013 \u0399\u03c3-\u03c3*|/\u03c3* in log-scale where \u03c3 and \u03c3* are the evaluation metrics on the reduced-benchmark and full-benchmark, respectively. Our method (BENTO-le) achieves 97% evaluation accuracy on average. The grey band reports the random selection baseline's mean\u00b1standard variation. All baselines are defined in Section 5. Table 2 reports the result when selecting different number of tasks.", "description": "The figure shows a chord graph illustrating the clusters of benchmark tasks based on in-context transferability and a bar chart comparing the evaluation accuracy of different task reduction methods.", "section": "1 INTRODUCTION"}]
