These models leverage autoencoders (VQGAN or VAE) to work in a compressed latent space, rather than directly on image pixels.  However, the authors point out a surprising discrepancy: while autoregressive models have dominated natural language processing (NLP) with models like GPT, their performance in image generation lags significantly behind LDMs and MIMs, despite potentially sharing the same latent space. This observation motivates the core research question: Is the traditional latent space approach truly optimal for image autoregressive modeling?

The goal is to offer a unified perspective on the relationship between latent space and generative models, and demonstrate a novel approach to improve the effectiveness of image autoregressive modeling.", "first_cons": "The introduction does not explicitly define what constitutes an \"optimal\" latent space for image generation, making the reader's understanding of the core problem somewhat ambiguous.

This leads to the proposal of a unified perspective emphasizing the stability of the latent space. The authors highlight the discrepancy between autoregressive models and LDMs/MIMs, where the former lags significantly behind the latter despite using the same latent space.  They analyze this discrepancy by examining the stability of latent space in relation to error propagation in iterative and autoregressive models, proposing a simple but effective metric to quantify the stability of different latent spaces induced by autoencoders and self-supervised learning models.
