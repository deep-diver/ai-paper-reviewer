The table shows quantitative results across various metrics (Background Consistency, Aesthetic Quality, Imaging Quality, Object Class, Multiple Objects, Color Consistency, Spatial Relationship, and Temporal Style) for several model variants.  The variants progressively include key components of the Mimir architecture: a decoder-only model, normalization, a semantic stabilizer, and a zero-convolution layer. Comparing the results across these variants highlights the contribution of each component to the overall performance improvements achieved by the complete Mimir model. The best and second-best results in each metric are highlighted for easy comparison.", "section": "3.2. Ablation Studies"}]
