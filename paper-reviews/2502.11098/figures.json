The left side shows traditional LLM-MA approaches which suffer from disorganized, lengthy text-based communication and simple, sequential refinement methods that struggle to manage multiple perspectives.  This often leads to inconsistent or suboptimal outcomes. In contrast, the right side presents TalkHier, highlighting its key improvements: a well-structured communication protocol and a hierarchical refinement strategy. The structured protocol promotes clearer, more efficient information exchange, and hierarchical refinement enables a more controlled and effective synthesis of diverse opinions leading to superior decision-making.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.11098/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Our TalkHier built on GPT4o surpasses inference scaling models (OpenAI-o1), open-source multi-agent models (AgentVerse and etc.), and models with majority voting strategies (ReAct, GPT4o) on five subtasks of MMLU.", "description": "Figure 2 presents a bar chart comparing the performance of different multi-agent systems on five subtasks of the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark.  The chart shows that the TalkHier model, built upon GPT-40, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SoTA) models. These SoTA models include inference scaling models (like OpenAI-01), open-source multi-agent systems (such as AgentVerse), and models that utilize majority voting strategies (like ReAct and GPT-40 with multiple runs).

The `Supervisor Prompt Template` guides the supervisor agent in assigning tasks to other agents, providing necessary background information, intermediate outputs, and instructions for the next agent's action.  It ensures a well-structured flow of information. The `Member Prompt Template` guides the member agents in understanding their assigned subtasks, using the provided background and conversation history to generate accurate and relevant responses. Both prompts emphasize structured communication to maintain clarity and efficiency throughout the collaborative process.", "section": "3.2 Context-Rich Communication Between Agents"}]
