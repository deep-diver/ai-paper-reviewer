However, existing MBRL methods often struggle to generalize across different tasks and environments, limiting their practical applicability. This paper tackles these challenges by focusing on improving Transformer World Models (TWMs), a type of world model that leverages the power of transformers to process and understand complex information.\nThe researchers propose three key improvements to the standard MBRL framework using TWMs: a more efficient training scheme called \"Dyna with warmup\", a novel image tokenization method using nearest neighbor search that simplifies the representation of visual inputs, and a modified training process called \"block teacher forcing\" that improves the quality of imagined trajectories. These innovations are combined with improvements to a model-free baseline, resulting in an MBRL algorithm that outperforms existing methods by a significant margin on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, even surpassing the performance of human players.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.01591/podcast.wav"}
