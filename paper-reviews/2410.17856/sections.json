End-to-end methods, while effective, are resource-intensive and difficult to scale due to the requirement of collecting and annotating large amounts of trajectory data. Hierarchical approaches, on the other hand, rely on language or future image generation as a communication protocol between high-level reasoners (VLMs) and low-level policies.  However, language often fails to convey spatial information effectively, and generating sufficiently accurate future images remains challenging. These limitations motivate the introduction of a novel visual-temporal context prompting approach, which the paper introduces as a solution.", "first_cons": "Existing end-to-end methods are resource-intensive and difficult to scale due to the need for large, precisely annotated datasets.

Observations and segmentations are concatenated and passed through a visual backbone for deep fusion. The interaction types and segmentations are randomly dropped with a set probability during training.  This architecture uses a 4-channel image (RGB + segmentation mask) as input to a TransformerXL model which takes into account the temporal dependencies in a sequence of observations, which enables the prediction of actions based on this visual-temporal context.  The method also includes a backward trajectory relabeling pipeline which uses SAM-2 to efficiently generate segmentations for training data.\n\n## Backward Trajectory Relabeling\n\nThis method aims to efficiently build a dataset for training ROCKET-1.  Instead of manually labeling, the method traverses the trajectory backward in time, segmenting interacting objects using a pre-trained vision-language model and SAM-2.  This allows for automated generation of training data with object segmentation masks and interaction types.  The window length for the backward trajectory is *k*, which is a hyperparameter. The authors use SAM-2, which is capable of temporal tracking, to effectively create these segmentations. \n\n## Offline Reinforcement Learning\n\nThe authors model the open-world interaction as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), focusing on learning a policy that maximizes cumulative reward.  The binary reward function R: O \u00d7 A \u00d7 C \u00d7 M \u2192 {0,1} is used to evaluate whether a specific interaction has been completed successfully. The objective of the reinforcement learning is to maximize the expected cumulative reward.   The training process involves randomly dropping segmentations with probability *p* (a hyperparameter) to prevent the model from overly relying on segmentation information and encourage learning from visual temporal context, ultimately improving generalization.\n\n## Interaction-Type Information Fusion\n\nThe authors explore two methods for fusing interaction-type information: within the visual backbone and within the TransformerXL.  Experimentation shows that fusing within the visual backbone achieves higher performance.  The method involves using a 4-channel image containing RGB and the segmentation mask, effectively combining visual and interaction information for the causal transformer.", "first_cons": "The method relies heavily on the availability and accuracy of the object segmentation provided by SAM-2.

The evaluation uses a newly introduced Minecraft Interaction Benchmark containing 12 tasks categorized into six interaction types (Hunt, Mine, Interact, Navigate, Tool, Place).  These tasks are designed to be more challenging than previous benchmarks by emphasizing precise spatial interactions; for example, hunting a sheep in a specific location, rather than just hunting any sheep.  The results showcase ROCKET-1's superior performance, particularly in zero-shot generalization where it achieves a 91% success rate on a task unseen during training.  This significant success underscores the system's ability to generalize and execute complex instructions beyond its training data. \n\nThe comparison with baselines (VPT, STEVE-1, GROOT-1) highlights ROCKET-1's significant improvement.  For short-horizon tasks, ROCKET-1, using either human-provided or Molmo-generated prompts, achieves success rates far exceeding the baselines; for example, nearing 100% success in several categories compared to baselines often below 10%, emphasizing its effectiveness at integrating visual-temporal information for action prediction.  The results are backed up by detailed quantitative data in Table 2, providing success rates for each task.  For long-horizon tasks (requiring complex planning and execution), ROCKET-1 consistently outperforms other hierarchical architectures (DEPS, MineDreamer, OmniJarvis) by a substantial margin, demonstrating its superior communication and interaction capabilities within the complex Minecraft environment. The visualizations in Figure 7 further illustrate the agent's successful completion of these difficult, multi-step tasks.\n\nAblation studies investigate the impact of different model components and hyperparameters. The analysis explores the effects of varying SAM-2 model sizes on both success rate and inference speed, the impact of interaction-type information fusion at different layers of the model, and the benefits of the randomized segmentation masking during training. These experiments are rigorously conducted and provide valuable insights into the design choices of ROCKET-1, highlighting the importance of integrating interaction cues appropriately to enhance the model's spatial understanding and temporal reasoning.  The ablation results clearly demonstrate that the visual backbone combined with interaction-type information in the transformer layer provides the best performance compared to other integration strategies.", "first_cons": "The reliance on a high-level reasoner (such as Molmo or a human) to provide spatial information might limit the fully autonomous operation of the system.
