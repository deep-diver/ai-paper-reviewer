Existing methods often rely on additional information like CAD models or multiple views, limiting their generalizability.  This necessitates a novel approach that leverages the abundance of 3D object models and the power of rendering. \n\nThe proposed method, Orient Anything, tackles these issues by creating a large-scale dataset of rendered images with precise orientation annotations from 3D models. It models orientation as probability distributions of angles rather than directly regressing the angle values, significantly improving robustness and accuracy.  Furthermore, it incorporates real-world prior knowledge and employs data augmentation strategies to address the domain gap between synthetic and real images, thus improving performance on real-world scenarios. This work makes considerable contributions to accurate object orientation estimation in images by introducing a novel, data-driven approach that outperforms existing techniques.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.18605/podcast.wav"}
