Applying these approaches to 3D is challenging due to the complexity and computational cost of processing 3D data. Existing methods either generate low-quality 3D models or are computationally expensive, lacking detailed understanding capabilities. \nSAR3D solves this by using a multi-scale 3D vector-quantized variational autoencoder (VQVAE) to create tokens of 3D objects. **This multi-scale approach drastically speeds up generation**, achieving sub-second times.  Furthermore, by enriching the tokens with 3D-aware information, **SAR3D allows for finetuning of LLMs, enabling detailed 3D understanding**. This combined approach surpasses current methods in both speed and quality, paving the way for faster and more detailed 3D AI applications.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2411.16856/podcast.wav"}
