We evaluate the quality of both 2D rendering and 3D shapes. As shown below, the proposed method demonstrates strong performance across all metrics.\nAlthough LGM, a multi-view images-to-3D approach, achieves slightly better performance on FID, it falls short on more advanced image quality assessment metrics such as MUSIQ and has significantly worse 3D shape quality.\nFor multi-view to 3D methods, we also include the number of input views (V=##\\##). The latency time is all profiled on Tesla V100 architecture.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of different image-conditioned 3D generation methods, evaluating both the 2D rendering quality and the 3D shape quality.  The metrics used include FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance), KID (Kernel Inception Distance), MUSIQ (Multi-scale Image Quality), COV (Coverage Score), MMD (Minimum Matching Distance), and generation time. The table shows that the proposed SAR3D method outperforms other methods in most metrics, demonstrating strong performance across all assessment criteria. While one competing method (LGM) shows slightly better FID scores,  its performance is significantly worse on higher-level image quality metrics like MUSIQ and 3D shape quality.  The number of input views used by multi-view methods is also specified.  All latency times reported were measured using a Tesla V100 GPU.", "section": "5.1 Single Image to 3D"}]
