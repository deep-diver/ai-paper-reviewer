Existing process supervision methods, while showing promise, often require extensive human-annotated data and suffer from unreliable evaluation, limiting their effectiveness.  Furthermore, these models often fail to self-correct or self-validate, highlighting a need for improved techniques. \nThis paper introduces Outcome-Refining Process Supervision (ORPS), a novel paradigm that leverages concrete execution signals to supervise reasoning steps. ORPS uses a tree-structured exploration space to maintain multiple solution trajectories and incorporates execution feedback for verification.  Experimental results demonstrate that ORPS enables even smaller LLMs to achieve high accuracy and performance on competitive programming tasks.  It surpasses the performance of existing methods across various models and datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of integrating execution feedback into process supervision for code generation.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.15118/podcast.wav"}
