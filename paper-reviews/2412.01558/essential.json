Existing methods also underutilize the power of large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal feature integration. \nVideoLights addresses these issues through a novel framework incorporating (1) a Convolutional Projection and Feature Refinement module to improve video-text alignment; (2) a Bi-Directional Cross-Modal Fusion network for strongly coupled clip representations; and (3) a Uni-directional Joint-Task Feedback mechanism.  Further enhancing performance, VideoLights introduces hard positive/negative losses and leverages LVLMs like BLIP-2 for intelligent pre-training.  Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, North South University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01558/podcast.wav"}
