It begins by acknowledging WAVES as the only comprehensive benchmark currently available for evaluating deep learning-based watermarking methods against large-scale generative models, but points out its limitations, namely only considering image regeneration and a limited number of watermarking methods (3). In contrast, the authors highlight their proposed benchmark, W-Bench, which includes image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation, covering seven widely used editing models, expanding the scope significantly.  The section then discusses prior work on robust watermarking, noting that while deep learning-based methods have shown robustness against classical transformations, they are vulnerable to generative model-based editing.  It mentions three recent studies that address this issue (EditGuard, Robust-Wide, and JigMark), pointing out limitations and the lack of open-source code for two of them.

It focuses on two key components: noise layers and the watermark encoder.  For noise layers, instead of directly integrating computationally expensive image editing processes, the authors leverage surrogate attacks. They analyze the frequency characteristics of image editing, identifying that high-frequency patterns are predominantly removed, while low-frequency patterns remain relatively unaffected. This observation mirrors the behavior of blurring distortions such as pixelation and defocus blur. Incorporating these blurring distortions into the noise layers enhances robustness against image editing during training. For the watermark encoder, the authors leverage a large-scale pretrained generative model, SDXL-Turbo, adapting it specifically for the watermarking task. The watermark encoder functions as a conditional generative model, taking original images and watermarks as input and generating watermarked images with a distinct distribution recognizable by the decoder.  This approach enhances both perceptual image quality and robustness.  A condition adaptor is used to fuse information from the input image and watermark before passing it to the VAE encoder of SDXL-Turbo. Skip connections and zero-convolution layers are added to enhance perceptual similarity between watermarked and original images.  The decoder utilizes ConvNeXt-B with an additional fully connected layer to output the 100-bit watermark. The training process balances image quality and watermark extraction effectiveness under image manipulations, using a combined loss function including image quality loss terms (MSE, LPIPS, GAN) and a binary cross-entropy loss for watermark extraction. A two-stage training strategy is employed: the first stage prioritizes watermark extraction with frozen SDXL-Turbo parameters, while the second stage unfreezes all parameters and refines performance.
