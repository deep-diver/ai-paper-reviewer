Historically, deep learning-based watermarking methods have proven effective against classical image manipulations such as compression, noise addition, scaling, and cropping. However, the advent of large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models has dramatically altered the landscape of image editing, creating highly realistic modifications that render existing watermarking techniques ineffective. These T2I models offer user-friendly tools, enabling malicious users to easily alter images and evade copyright protection.  The introduction highlights the critical need for robust watermarking methods that can withstand these advanced image editing techniques.  The paper introduces a comprehensive benchmark (W-Bench) to evaluate the robustness of current watermarking techniques against four main categories of image editing: image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation.  Eleven representative watermarking methods are mentioned as evaluated on this benchmark.  The limitations of current methods are highlighted, setting the stage for the introduction of a novel, more robust watermarking approach.", "first_cons": "The introduction focuses heavily on the problem statement without providing specifics on the limitations of existing watermarking techniques beyond general statements.

It introduces two key innovations: analyzing the frequency characteristics of image editing to identify that blurring distortions exhibit similar frequency properties, and leveraging a pretrained diffusion model (SDXL-Turbo) for watermark embedding.  The first innovation uses blurring distortions as surrogate attacks during training to improve watermark robustness against the actual image editing operations.  The second uses SDXL-Turbo's generative capabilities to embed watermarks more imperceptibly and robustly.  This involves adapting SDXL-Turbo for the watermarking task, treating the watermark encoder as a conditional generative model.  The loss function balances image quality (using PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and GAN loss) and watermark extraction effectiveness (using cross-entropy loss). A two-stage training strategy is used: the first focuses on watermark extraction, freezing parts of SDXL-Turbo, and the second unfreezes all parameters to refine the model, resulting in VINE-B.
