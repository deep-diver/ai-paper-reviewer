Historically, watermarking techniques have been effective against classical transformations like compression, noise addition, scaling, and cropping. However, recent advancements in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models significantly enhance image editing capabilities, allowing for highly realistic modifications that render existing watermarks nearly undetectable.  This poses a serious challenge to copyright and intellectual property protection as malicious users can easily alter images, even with watermarks present, to create new content without proper attribution.  This section introduces the problem of current image watermarking methods being vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques enabled by large-scale T2I models and sets the stage for the need for more robust methods. The vulnerability of existing methods is a significant threat to copyright protection, as they fail to detect watermarks after editing, emphasizing the urgency to address this issue.", "first_cons": "Existing watermarking techniques are vulnerable to advanced image editing, failing to detect watermarks after edits.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly highlights the problem of current watermarking methods being ineffective against modern image editing techniques.", "keypoints": ["Existing deep learning-based watermarking methods are vulnerable to advanced image editing techniques.", "Large-scale text-to-image (T2I) models enable highly realistic image modifications, making existing watermarks undetectable.", "This vulnerability poses a significant challenge to copyright and intellectual property protection."], "second_cons": "The introduction focuses primarily on the problem and doesn't offer any solutions or suggest directions for improvement.", "second_pros": "It effectively sets the context for the paper by clearly defining the limitations of existing watermarking techniques and the challenges posed by modern image editing technology.", "summary": "This introduction highlights the critical vulnerability of current image watermarking techniques to advanced image editing enabled by large-scale text-to-image models.

This robustness is achieved through two key innovations: 1) using blurring distortions as surrogate attacks during training to enhance watermark robustness against the frequency-based patterns removed by image editing; and 2) leveraging the SDXL-Turbo pretrained diffusion model as a powerful generative prior, adapting it for watermark encoding to ensure imperceptibility and robustness simultaneously. The method details include the process of analyzing the frequency characteristics of various image editing methods to understand how they affect the watermark's frequency components. The authors identify that image editing tends to remove watermark patterns in higher frequency bands while leaving the low-frequency bands less affected, a property also exhibited by blurring distortions. Therefore, they incorporate various blurring distortions into the noise layers of their model during training to bolster watermark robustness against image editing. For the watermark encoder, they adapt SDXL-Turbo, utilizing it as a conditional generative model. The encoder takes the original image and watermark as input and generates watermarked images with a distinct distribution. To integrate the input image and the watermark, a condition adaptor fuses the information before feeding it into the VAE encoder. Skip connections and zero-convolution layers are also added to improve the perceptual similarity between the watermarked and original images. The objective function balances the quality of the watermarked image with the effectiveness of watermark extraction under image manipulations. In addition, the method description touches upon resolution scaling, a strategy to adapt the model to handle images of arbitrary resolutions without sacrificing image quality or robustness.", "first_cons": "The training process involves a multi-stage approach, which increases complexity and potentially requires significant computational resources.", "first_pros": "The proposed VINE model demonstrates significant improvements in watermarking robustness against a wide range of image editing techniques, outperforming existing methods.", "keypoints": ["Leveraging blurring distortions as surrogate attacks during training (mimicking the frequency-based impact of image editing).", "Adapting SDXL-Turbo, a pretrained diffusion model, for watermark encoding as a conditional generative model.", "Utilizing a condition adaptor to effectively fuse the original image and watermark information.", "Employing skip connections and zero-convolution layers to enhance image perceptual quality.", "A two-stage training strategy: initially focusing on watermark extraction, and then balancing image quality and robustness."], "second_cons": "The reliance on a large pretrained diffusion model (SDXL-Turbo) might limit the method's accessibility or deployment to environments with limited computational resources.", "second_pros": "The method introduces a novel approach to watermarking by analyzing the frequency characteristics of image editing and leveraging the power of a large-scale pretrained generative model for encoding.", "summary": "This method section introduces VINE, a novel invisible watermarking method robust against image editing.
