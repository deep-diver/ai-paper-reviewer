Existing watermarking methods struggle against such advanced edits, where watermarks are often distorted or removed.  The researchers created a benchmark, W-Bench, to test different methods against these edits (image regeneration, global and local editing, and image-to-video generation).  VINE uses two key innovations: First, it analyzes how different edits affect an image's frequency components and uses blurring as a kind of \"stand-in\" for the more complex edits during training to improve robustness.  Second, it uses a pre-trained image generation model (SDXL-Turbo) to more effectively and invisibly embed the watermark.  Experiments show that VINE significantly outperforms existing methods in both maintaining image quality and resisting edits."}
