Current methods struggle to survive advanced edits that alter images without readily apparent changes.  The authors introduce W-Bench, a new benchmark to test these methods' resilience against various editing techniques (like regeneration, global and local changes, and even conversion to video).  Testing eleven existing methods, most failed to preserve the watermark under these advanced edits.  To address this, the authors developed a new method called VINE. VINE cleverly incorporates blurring distortions (which mimic the effects of some AI editing processes) into its training.  This helps the watermarking process become more resistant to such edits.  Additionally, VINE uses a powerful AI model (SDXL-Turbo) to more effectively and imperceptibly embed the watermark, enhancing image quality.  Experiments showed that VINE significantly outperformed existing methods in terms of both the watermarks' survival rate after edits and the quality of the watermarked images.  This is a valuable contribution because it tackles a critical challenge in copyright protection in the face of powerful image manipulation tools."}
