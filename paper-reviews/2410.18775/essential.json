The authors introduce W-Bench, a new benchmark evaluating watermarking techniques' resilience to image regeneration, global and local editing, and image-to-video generation.  Most existing methods struggle against these advanced edits.  To address this, the paper presents VINE, a novel watermarking technique. VINE analyzes how image editing affects image frequency characteristics, leveraging this knowledge to incorporate blurring distortions during training. VINE also uses a pre-trained diffusion model for watermark embedding, resulting in improved invisibility and resilience. Experiments show that VINE significantly outperforms existing methods in both image quality and robustness against various editing techniques."}
