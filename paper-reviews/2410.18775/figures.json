We utilize the pretrained one-step text-to-image model SDXL-Turbo as the watermark encoder. A condition adaptor is incorporated to fuse the watermark with the image before passing the information to the VAE encoder. Zero-convolution layers (Zhang et al., 2023) and skip connections are added for better perceptual similarity. For decoding the watermark, we employ ConvNeXt-B (Liu et al., 2022b) as the decoder, with an additional fully connected layer to output a 100-bit watermark. Throughout the entire training process, the SDXL-Turbo text prompt is set to null prompt.
