The experiment tested the ability to generate input images that would produce different classification labels depending on the GPU used for inference.  The success of this process is indicated by an 'X' in the table. The experiment was conducted using a batch size of 1, meaning that only one image was processed at a time for each inference.", "section": "5.2 White-box Attacks"}]
