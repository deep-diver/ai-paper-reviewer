Hand-designed controllers often lack the adaptability needed for complex tasks, while imitation learning methods struggle to generalize well.  \n\nThe paper introduces HIL-SERL, a human-in-the-loop vision-based RL system to overcome these issues.  By integrating human demonstrations and corrections with efficient RL algorithms and thoughtful system design, HIL-SERL achieves near-perfect success rates on complex tasks, outperforming existing methods by a significant margin.  The framework demonstrates the practicality of vision-based RL for real-world manipulation and offers valuable insights into effective RL strategies for complex tasks.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}}
