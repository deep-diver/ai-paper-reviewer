Existing methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and real-world performance.  Current approaches either rely heavily on simulation, require extensive training time, or struggle with the complexities of real-world physics and perception.  Many existing techniques also lack generalizability across diverse robotic manipulation tasks. \n\nThis paper introduces HIL-SERL, a novel human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning system that efficiently addresses these issues. **HIL-SERL integrates human demonstrations and corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and several system-level design choices to learn high-performing policies.** The approach significantly outperforms imitation learning and prior RL methods, achieving near-perfect success rates within 1-2.5 hours of real-world training across a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks.  **HIL-SERL demonstrates that RL can effectively learn complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world, advancing the field towards the goal of truly autonomous robotic manipulation.**"}
