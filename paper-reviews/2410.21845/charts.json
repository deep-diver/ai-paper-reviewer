This figure presents the success rate, cycle time, and intervention rates for both HIL-SERL and DAgger across few representative tasks, displayed as a running average over 20 episodes. For HIL-SERL, the success rate increased rapidly throughout training, eventually reaching 100%, while the intervention rate and cycle time progressively decreased, with the intervention rate ultimately reaching 0%. For HG-DAgger, the success rate fluctuates throughout training episodes and does not necessarily increase as training progresses. Since interventions occur frequently, leading to successful outcomes, the true policy success rate is likely lower than the curve suggests. Additionally, the intervention rate does not consistently decrease over time, indicating that the policy is not steadily improving. This is reflected in the cycle time as well, which shows no improvement, as DAgger lacks a mechanism to enhance performance beyond the provided training data.
