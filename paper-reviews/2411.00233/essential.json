Current methods often struggle with the complexity and variability of real-world battery data.  This paper introduces SambaMixer, a state-of-the-art model designed to tackle these challenges.  Traditional models are often complex or computationally expensive.  \nSambaMixer uses a novel approach based on Mamba state space models, known for their efficiency in processing long sequences of data.  It includes innovative resampling techniques to standardize the length of time series data and positional encoding to leverage additional time-related information (jitter, length differences). The results demonstrate that SambaMixer outperforms existing methods on the NASA battery dataset, showcasing its improved accuracy and robustness for SOH prediction. The open-sourced code makes it accessible to other researchers.", "affiliation": "UNED - Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia, Madrid, Spain", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}}
