{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers due to its **in-depth analysis of LT problems in LVLMs** and the introduction of **ADR**, a novel framework, easily integrated into open-source LVLMs. ADR's dual approach of rebalancing and synthesizing data addresses unique challenges. The **significant performance gains** without increasing data volume make it highly relevant for advancing more robust and balanced multimodal AI systems.", "summary": "ADR balances visual-language models by adaptively calibrating long-tail data, boosting LLaVA 1.5 by 4.36% without increasing training data volume.", "takeaways": ["LVLMs suffer from significant long-tail problems due to imbalanced training data, causing over-representation of head concepts and under-representation of tail concepts.", "The Adaptive Data Refinement Framework (ADR) effectively mitigates long-tail issues by adaptively rebalancing data and synthesizing scarce examples.", "ADR enhances model performance across various benchmarks and improves tail concept performance without increasing the training data volume."], "tldr": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often struggle with **long-tail (LT) problems**, where some data categories are over-represented while others are scarce. Current methods focus on traditional VLM architectures and specific tasks, leaving the broader exploration of LVLMs and general tasks under-explored. A key issue identified here is that head concepts are overly represented while tail concepts are under-represented, leading to imbalanced model performance.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces an **Adaptive Data Refinement Framework (ADR)**, consisting of Data Rebalancing (DR) and Data Synthesis (DS) stages. DR adaptively rebalances redundant data based on entity distributions, while DS uses Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models to supplement under-represented portions. The results show that ADR effectively improves the performance of LLaVA 1.5 across eleven benchmarks by 4.36% without increasing the data volume.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.12821/podcast.wav"}
