This paper finds that a common positional encoding technique, Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), causes this issue due to its long-term decay, making distant visual cues less influential.  To address this, they propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA).  CCA reorganizes the order of visual tokens in the input, bringing those related to the instruction closer together.  This simple yet effective positional alignment strategy significantly reduces object hallucination by improving the interaction between visual and instruction tokens in LVLMs. Experiments show CCA outperforms other strategies on several benchmarks."}
