This paper finds that this is partly due to a positional encoding method (RoPE) which makes the model less sensitive to visual information further away from the text. To fix this, the researchers developed 'Concentric Causal Attention' (CCA). CCA improves the model's understanding of where visual information is relative to the text prompts, and substantially improves accuracy in various tests."}
