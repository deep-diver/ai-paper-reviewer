(a) a schematic view of inference in LVLMs, typically involving a pre-trained vision encoder, a large language model and a projector to map visual tokens to textual space. For each of V visual tokens Svision, we aggregate its information flow to instruction tokens Sinstruct and reshape the aggregation results to 2-D (\u221aV by \u221aV). Applying RoPE on visual tokens introduces long-term decay as illustrated in (c), referring to the phenomenon where information flowing from visual tokens to instruction tokens gradually decays from lower-right region (rightmost visual tokens in the 1-D sequence) to upper-left region (leftmost visual tokens). For instruction tokens, they have much less direct interaction with leftmost visual tokens as compared with rightmost visual tokens, leading to inferior multimodal alignment in the trained LVLMs. (b) and (c) are derived from the adversarial subset of the 3k POPE [41] image-instruction pairs.

Left: Visual Token Re-organization. In comparison to raster-scan positional alignment in (a), we design concentric position alignment in (b) which shortens visual-instruction distance and retains spatial locality for 2-D data like images. Right: Concentric Causal Masking. By default as in (c), a visual token attends to all preceding visual tokens in a 1-D sequence. In contrast, our concentric causal attention in (d) models 2-D continuous positional dependencies among visual tokens, where center visual tokens attend to peripheral ones. Causal masks are V by V where in this case V is 36 for demonstration purpose.
