The authors introduce the architecture of LVLMs, focusing on how RoPE encodes positional information. They then highlight the phenomenon of *long-term decay* in RoPE, where the influence of visual tokens on instruction tokens diminishes with increasing distance. A pilot experiment is conducted by training two LVLMs with different positional alignment strategies: one following the standard raster-scan order and the other reversing this order. The results show a strong correlation between RoPE's long-term decay and object hallucination, with the reversed order model exhibiting less hallucination when the object is located in the upper part of the image, and the standard model performing better when the object is in the lower part.  This suggests that the long-term decay in RoPE negatively impacts multimodal alignment in LVLMs, leading to object hallucination.", "first_cons": "The pilot experiment only uses two specific positional alignment strategies (raster-scan and reversed raster-scan).

This concentric organization, starting from the periphery and moving towards the center of the 2D image, naturally reduces the relative distance between visual and instruction tokens.  To further enhance this effect, CCA also rectifies the causal attention mask to reflect the 2D spatial locality of images. The results from multiple object hallucination benchmarks show significant improvements in accuracy (+4.24%) and F1 score (+2.73%) over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of CCA in alleviating object hallucination caused by the inherent limitations of RoPE.
