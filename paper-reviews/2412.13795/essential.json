This inefficiency wastes computational resources and limits potential model performance.  While **Post-LN** maintains strong deep layer gradients, it suffers from vanishing gradients in early layers. Existing research often frames this inefficiency as a compression opportunity, overlooking the potential of unlocking these layers' full capacity.\nThis paper introduces **Mix-LN**, a novel normalization technique that combines Pre-LN and Post-LN. Mix-LN applies Post-LN in initial layers and Pre-LN in later layers. This creates **more uniform gradient norms**, allowing both shallow and deep layers to contribute effectively. Experiments across various LLM sizes show that **Mix-LN consistently outperforms** Pre-LN and Post-LN. It achieves better pre-training results, more effective supervised fine-tuning, and enhanced reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The findings underscore the importance of high-quality deep layers for powerful LLMs, offering a promising way to improve performance without increasing model size.", "affiliation": "University of Surrey", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.13795/podcast.wav"}
