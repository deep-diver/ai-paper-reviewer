It's benchmarked against other methods on Chinese datasets, demonstrating competitive performance.  The researchers then integrate KeyNMF into a pipeline for analyzing information dynamics, specifically focusing on novelty and resonance (how new and persistent information is within a system). This pipeline is applied to five Chinese news sites in the lead-up to the 2024 European parliamentary elections. The results reveal clear correlations between information dynamics and significant political events, such as the Xi Jinping's European tour and the EU parliamentary elections. The study highlights the effectiveness of KeyNMF for understanding information flows in complex media systems and lays groundwork for further research into media manipulation and political influence. The researchers released their implementation of KeyNMF as part of the Turftopic Python package, making their work reproducible and accessible to other researchers.  The findings contribute to understanding political communication in Chinese diaspora media and the impact of global events."}
