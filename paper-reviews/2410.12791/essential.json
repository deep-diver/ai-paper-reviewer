Unlike traditional methods like LDA, KeyNMF is robust to preprocessing issues and performs well even with limited data.  The researchers apply KeyNMF to five news sites targeting the Chinese diaspora in Europe in the run-up to the 2024 European Parliamentary elections.  By integrating KeyNMF with established methods for measuring novelty and resonance of information, they uncover patterns demonstrating how information dynamics in Chinese media respond to significant political events.  Key findings reveal clear correlations between the novelty and resonance of information and real-world events like Xi Jinping\u2019s European tour, Putin\u2019s visit to China, and the EU elections. The results demonstrate KeyNMF's effectiveness in studying information dynamics and lay the foundation for further research on how Chinese media attempts to influence political discourse.  The paper contributes a novel methodological pipeline for quantitative media analysis and valuable empirical insights into the information dynamics shaping political perceptions within diaspora communities."}
