It begins by introducing the concept of information dynamics and its significance in analyzing cultural shifts and debates.  The study of information dynamics, particularly in the context of the French Revolution, is described with the aid of information-theoretic measures of *novelty* and *resonance*. Novelty measures how much a new time slice diverges from preceding time slices, while resonance shows information persistence.  These metrics are typically calculated using probability distributions from topic models, particularly Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, the section points out several shortcomings of LDA, such as its sensitivity to pre-processing, its inability to utilize contextual and syntactic information, its reliance on the bag-of-words assumption, its sensitivity to hyperparameters, and its limited generalizability to languages like Chinese.  These limitations are further explained by comparing LDA to its alternative dynamic topic models which attempt to handle temporal aspects of topic evolution, but suffer from the weakness of being parameter-rich. The section sets the stage for the introduction of the authors' proposed method, KeyNMF, which will address these shortcomings.", "first_cons": "The section primarily critiques existing methods without fully exploring their potential strengths or alternative applications.

It addresses shortcomings of traditional methods like LDA by using contextual embeddings to compute keyword importances from documents.  These importances are then decomposed using NMF. The process involves using an encoder model to produce document and word embeddings, selecting the N keywords with the highest cosine similarity to the document embedding, arranging these similarities into a non-negative keyword matrix, and finally decomposing this matrix using NMF to obtain document-topic and topic-term matrices.  A dynamic extension, Dynamic KeyNMF, is also presented to model topic evolution over time by calculating time-specific topic-term importances in predefined time slices and using NMF to decompose them. The effectiveness of KeyNMF is demonstrated through benchmark evaluations on Chinese datasets, showing competitive performance compared to existing methods.  The method utilizes a novel approach to topic modeling that incorporates contextual word embeddings for creating context-sensitive topics.  The evaluation metrics include the diversity, internal word embedding coherence, and external word embedding coherence of topic descriptions generated by the model.", "first_cons": "The performance of KeyNMF might be sensitive to the choice of the number of keywords (N).
