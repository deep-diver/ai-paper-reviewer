Unlike existing benchmarks that focus solely on accuracy, UCFE incorporates human feedback and dynamic, multi-round interactions, mimicking real-world financial scenarios.  Researchers surveyed users to understand their needs and built a dataset reflecting diverse tasks and user types (analysts, financial professionals, regulators, general public). They tested 12 LLMs using the LLM-as-Judge methodology, finding significant alignment between human preferences and benchmark scores (Pearson correlation of 0.78).  This highlights UCFE's effectiveness and reveals that mid-sized models often outperform larger ones due to better balance between efficiency and performance. The study also highlights the importance of user-centric design for LLM evaluation in finance and provides the benchmark's data and code for public use. This addresses several limitations of prior benchmarks, which often focus only on accuracy and ignore broader contextual factors. UCFE is a robust framework to assess LLM capabilities in this complex, ever-changing domain."}
