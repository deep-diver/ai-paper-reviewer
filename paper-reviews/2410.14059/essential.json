Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on static datasets and single-turn questions, UCFE incorporates user feedback and dynamic, multi-turn interactions to create more realistic evaluation scenarios. This approach aims to bridge the gap between technical capabilities and real-world applicability.  The research involved creating a dataset based on 804 participants' feedback on various financial tasks.  They then evaluated 12 LLM services using the data, employing a novel 'LLM-as-Judge' methodology, in which another LLM compares responses. Their findings show a significant correlation (0.78) between the benchmark scores and human preferences, thus validating their evaluation.  UCFE successfully reveals that while LLMs show promise, there are significant performance gaps in handling the complexities and dynamic nature of real-world financial challenges.  The dataset and evaluation code are publicly available."}
