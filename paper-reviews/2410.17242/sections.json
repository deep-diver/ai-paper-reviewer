These biases, incorporating 3D priors and handcrafted structures, simplify the task and aim to improve synthesis quality. Recent advancements like NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and their variants have significantly progressed the field. These methods introduce inductive biases through carefully designed 3D representations (e.g., continuous volumetric fields and Gaussian primitives) and rendering equations (e.g., ray marching and splatting).  However, these 3D inductive biases inherently limit model flexibility, constraining their adaptability to diverse and complex scenarios. Large reconstruction models (LRMs) have made progress in mitigating architecture-level biases using large transformers, but they still rely on representation-level biases like NeRFs, meshes, or 3DGS, hindering their generalization and scalability.

IBR methods, such as light field methods, reconstruct a scene from numerous views and blend them together, but struggle with sparse inputs and limited view extrapolation. Optimizing 3D representations focuses on methods that optimize 3D structures, such as neural radiance fields (NeRFs), to enhance rendering quality.  These methods, though impressive, often rely on specific 3D priors, such as the use of continuous volumetric fields or Gaussian primitives, limiting their adaptability.  Finally, generalizable feed-forward methods aim to directly generate novel views from input views using neural networks trained across multiple scenes.  These methods, while more efficient, often incorporate additional 3D inductive biases like plane sweeps or epipolar lines, again limiting their generalizability.

Both models utilize a transformer-based approach to synthesize novel views from sparse input images without relying on explicit 3D scene representations or pre-defined rendering equations. The encoder-decoder LVSM first encodes input images into 1D latent tokens representing a learned scene representation.  The decoder then uses these latent tokens along with target view Pl\u00fccker ray embeddings to generate the output images. In contrast, the decoder-only LVSM directly maps input images to novel view outputs, completely eliminating the intermediate latent scene representation. The input images and Pl\u00fccker rays are patchified (using a patch size of 8), linearly projected into tokens, and then processed by the transformer.  The loss function combines mean squared error (MSE) and perceptual loss, balancing fidelity and perceptual quality.  The training procedure includes techniques such as QK-Norm to improve stability, FlashAttention-v2 for efficiency, and gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training for faster training times.
