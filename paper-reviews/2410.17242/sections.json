Recent advancements, such as NeRF, 3DGS, and their variants, have made significant progress by introducing new inductive biases through carefully designed 3D representations and rendering equations.  However, these 3D inductive biases inherently limit model flexibility and adaptability to diverse and complex scenarios.

IBR methods, such as those using weighted blending of input images or light field approaches, are limited by their reliance on dense view inputs and the restricted renderable regions.  Methods optimizing 3D representations, primarily based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) and their variants (e.g., 3DGS), have significantly advanced NVS quality through the use of carefully designed 3D representations and rendering equations. However, these methods often involve computationally expensive per-scene optimization processes and are limited by the inherent constraints imposed by their specific 3D inductive biases. Generalizable feed-forward methods use pre-trained networks to directly generate novel views, avoiding per-scene optimization, but prior works often relied on additional 3D inductive biases such as projective epipolar lines or plane-sweep volumes or lacked scalability and high-frequency detail.  The section highlights recent advances in using large reconstruction models (LRMs) based on transformers, which have made progress in removing architecture-level biases, but still often utilize representation-level biases (NeRFs, meshes, or 3DGS) which limit their generalization and scalability.

Two variants are presented: an encoder-decoder model and a decoder-only model. Both eliminate traditional 3D inductive biases, relying instead on a fully data-driven transformer-based approach. The encoder-decoder model processes input image tokens through an encoder transformer, generating a fixed-length 1D latent token representation of the scene. A decoder transformer then utilizes target-view Pl\u00fccker rays as positional embeddings to generate novel view images. In contrast, the decoder-only model directly maps input image tokens and target-view Pl\u00fccker rays to novel-view image tokens, forgoing any intermediate scene representation.  A linear layer and sigmoid function regress the final pixel colors.  Both models are trained using a photometric novel view rendering loss, combining MSE and perceptual losses.  Implementation details include patchification of images and Pl\u00fccker ray embeddings,  the use of a full transformer model (specified as *M*) for token processing, and the inverse operation of flattening to recover the spatial structure of the output tokens. The encoder-decoder model leverages learnable latent tokens and multiple transformer layers for encoding and decoding.
