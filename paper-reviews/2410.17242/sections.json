Recent advancements, such as NeRF, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and their variants, have made significant progress by introducing new inductive biases through carefully designed 3D representations and rendering equations. These methods frame view synthesis as optimizing representations using rendering losses on a per-scene basis. Other approaches build generalizable networks to estimate representations or directly generate novel views, often incorporating additional 3D inductive biases like projective epipolar lines or plane-sweep volumes. While effective, these 3D inductive biases limit model flexibility and adaptability to diverse and complex scenarios.  Large reconstruction models (LRMs) have shown progress in mitigating architecture-level biases by using large transformers without relying on epipolar projections or plane sweeps, but they still often depend on representation-level biases like NeRFs, meshes, or 3DGS, restricting generalization and scalability.", "first_cons": "The heavy reliance on 3D inductive biases in existing methods limits their flexibility and generalizability to diverse and complex scenarios, hindering their ability to handle real-world complexities effectively.", "first_pros": "The introduction provides a clear overview of the history and current state of novel view synthesis, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the potential benefits of the proposed approach.", "keypoints": ["Existing methods heavily rely on 3D inductive biases (3D priors and handcrafted structures).", "Recent advancements like NeRF and 3DGS have significantly improved quality but still rely on inductive biases.", "Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) are making progress in removing architecture-level biases but still rely on representation-level biases.", "The limitations of existing methods are hindering the progress of novel view synthesis."], "second_cons": "While acknowledging the progress of LRMs, the introduction doesn't deeply analyze their specific limitations or how the proposed method surpasses them beyond a general statement of improved scalability and generalization.", "second_pros": "The historical overview clearly sets the stage for the proposed approach, highlighting the need for a solution that addresses the limitations of existing techniques and aims for greater scalability and generalizability.", "summary": "The introduction to the paper establishes the context of novel view synthesis, highlighting the prevalent use of 3D inductive biases in existing methods.  These biases, while effective in simplifying the task, limit the flexibility and generalizability of these techniques.  Recent progress from methods like NeRF and 3DGS, and even Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs), are noted but ultimately found to be limited in their scalability and generalizability due to their continued reliance on various forms of 3D inductive biases.

IBR methods, such as light field methods, utilize weighted blending of input images or depth maps, but are limited by the proximity of renderable regions to input viewpoints. Optimizing 3D representations, pioneered by NeRF (Neural Radiance Fields), involve defining differentiable 3D scene representations (e.g., volumetric fields, point clouds, or Gaussian splatting) and rendering equations to synthesize novel views through optimization. These methods often incorporate 3D inductive biases, simplifying the task but potentially limiting flexibility and generalization.  Generalizable feed-forward methods aim to directly generate novel views from input images using learned networks. While avoiding explicit 3D representation optimization, these methods often incorporate 3D inductive biases into their architectures (e.g., projective lines, plane sweeps), hindering their scalability and generalization capabilities to diverse scenarios. The review also notes that recent Large Reconstruction Models (LRMs) utilize large transformers to learn generic 3D priors without explicit rendering equations or scene representations. Although improving quality, LRMs still rely on representation-level biases (NeRFs, meshes, or 3DGS), which limit their full potential.
