Unlike many previous methods that heavily rely on 3D assumptions about the scene (like depth information or specific geometric structures), LVSM takes a more data-driven approach. It uses transformers, a type of neural network architecture known for its ability to handle sequential data effectively.  The researchers propose two versions of LVSM: one with an encoder-decoder structure and one that's decoder-only.  The encoder-decoder version first compresses the input images into a compact representation, and then generates new views from this compressed representation.  The decoder-only version directly generates the new views from the input images without any intermediate representation. Both versions significantly outperform existing methods in terms of image quality (measured by PSNR and other metrics) and show improved scalability, meaning they can handle larger scenes and more complex datasets more efficiently. The decoder-only version, in particular, demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization capabilities\u2014 meaning it can produce high-quality images even for numbers of input views it hasn't been trained on. The improvement is achieved by completely removing or minimizing intermediate 3D-related scene representations, thus, allowing the model to focus on directly learning image generation from input data. Overall, LVSM represents a significant step forward in view synthesis, offering a more flexible and effective approach compared to existing methods."}
