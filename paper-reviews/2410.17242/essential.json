Unlike previous methods that relied on 3D information, LVSM uses a data-driven approach. This means it learns directly from images without pre-built 3D models, making it more flexible and adaptable. They propose two versions: an encoder-decoder model and a decoder-only model. The encoder-decoder model processes images into a compact representation before creating the new views. The decoder-only model creates the new views directly from the input images.  The decoder-only model performed better in terms of image quality and the ability to handle various input image numbers. Experiments across multiple datasets showed that both versions of LVSM outperformed existing methods. This is significant because it shows that high-quality images can be created from different viewpoints without needing complex 3D models, opening up opportunities for various applications."}
