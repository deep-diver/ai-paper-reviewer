Unlike previous methods that heavily rely on pre-defined 3D structures and assumptions about how the world works (3D inductive biases), LVSM uses a data-driven approach.  This means it learns directly from the input images, without needing extra 3D information. Two versions of LVSM were developed: one that creates an intermediate 3D representation (encoder-decoder) and one that directly maps input images to output images (decoder-only).  The decoder-only version significantly outperforms the encoder-decoder version and previous state-of-the-art models in terms of image quality and generalizability. The authors achieve these results without relying on extensive computational power, showcasing the model's efficiency and scalability."}
