Unlike older methods that rely heavily on pre-programmed assumptions about 3D shapes and how light interacts with them (3D inductive biases), LVSM learns directly from data. It uses two different transformer-based architectures: one with an encoder and decoder and another decoder-only version. Both versions work well, but the decoder-only version is superior. It significantly improves the quality and scalability of the produced images and impressively generalizes to unseen scenarios. The results show that LVSM produces higher quality images than previous methods, even when using less computing power."}
