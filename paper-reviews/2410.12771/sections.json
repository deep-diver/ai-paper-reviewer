The dataset is designed to enable property predictions from equilibrium and non-equilibrium states and aims to help improve the performance of AI-assisted materials science.  The dataset is diverse in terms of its elemental composition and the structures cover a wide range of sizes, from 1 to 100 atoms per structure, with the majority of structures having less than 20 atoms.  This is mainly due to starting from structures in the Alexandria dataset. The data includes total energy, forces and cell stress for each structure.
