The table displays how the model progressively refines the video by adjusting bounding boxes, adding elements (toy cars), and clarifying prompts to ensure alignment with the initial request. This showcases the multi-agent collaborative approach and iterative refinement process central to the GENMAC framework.", "section": "B. Additional Experimental Results"}]
