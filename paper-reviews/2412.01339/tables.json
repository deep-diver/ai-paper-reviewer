It compares different methods (using negative prompts alone or in combination with NegToMe) for reducing visual similarity to copyrighted characters. The metrics used are Dreamsim (lower scores indicate less visual similarity), VQAScore (higher scores indicate better image quality), CLIPScore (higher scores mean better text-image alignment), and Inception Score (IS; higher scores indicate better image quality). The results show that NegToMe significantly reduces visual similarity to copyrighted material while maintaining or improving other performance metrics.", "section": "4.2 Copyright Mitigation"}]
