Current methods struggle with either too many parameters (making them slow and resource-intensive) or an inefficient fusion of image and text data. ADEM-VL tackles this by using a clever technique called 'parameter-free cross-attention'. This simplifies the fusion process, drastically cutting down on the number of things the computer needs to learn.  It also includes a 'multiscale visual prompting' scheme to better incorporate image details and an 'adaptive fusion' method that focuses on the most important visual information for a given text.  Experiments showed that ADEM-VL outperforms existing methods on tasks like visual question answering and image captioning, all while being significantly faster and needing less computing power."}
