It uses a technique called parameter-free cross-attention to reduce the number of parameters in the model and speed up both training and inference, which is important because training large vision-language models usually requires a lot of computing power and memory.  The approach also incorporates multiscale visual features to better represent images. Additionally, they have an adaptive fusion approach that dynamically prioritizes the most important visual details for processing. Experiments on various vision-language tasks such as question answering and captioning show that ADEM-VL performs better than existing methods while being more efficient. The researchers suggest that their approach makes it more feasible to use larger language models in vision-language applications, which opens up new possibilities for building more powerful multimodal systems."}
