However, it points out that building these models is resource-intensive, primarily due to the long input sequences combining language and visual features which demand more computational power, and the large number of trainable parameters increasing memory requirements. This efficiency limitation hinders broader application. The existing approaches for multimodal fusion are categorized into two types: those fusing in the feature space (often using cross-attention mechanisms at each LLM layer, leading to a large number of parameters) and those fusing in the input space (concatenating visual and text information at the beginning, resulting in extended input sequences and thus increasing computational cost quadratically).  The authors state that previous attempts at parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods for VL models haven't fully integrated visual information or achieved optimal results.  This section concludes by introducing the paper's proposed solution, ADEM-VL, an efficient vision-language method that aims to overcome these challenges using a parameter-free cross-attention mechanism and an adaptive fusion scheme for efficient multimodal tuning based on pretrained LLMs.", "first_cons": "The introduction does not offer a detailed breakdown of the computational complexity of the existing methods.

In multimodal architectures, it categorizes existing approaches into feature-space fusion (fusing visual information into the language model at intermediate layers, often using cross-attention) and input-space fusion (directly fusing vision and text information at the LLM's input stage).  The section highlights the challenges of both approaches: feature-space fusion often introduces many extra parameters (e.g., each LLM layer needing its own cross-attention module), while input-space fusion leads to increased computational complexity due to longer input sequences.  The discussion then transitions into parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, broadly classifying them into those that introduce new trainable parameters (e.g., adapters, LoRA) and those that don't (e.g., BitFit).  The limitations of applying general PEFT methods to VL models are discussed, highlighting the shortcomings of existing approaches in either fully integrating visual information or achieving optimal performance.

It begins by reformulating the standard cross-attention mechanism into a parameter-free version, drastically reducing the number of trainable parameters.  This is achieved by replacing the parameterized similarity measurement with a parameter-free approach using the SiLU activation function, eliminating most learnable parameters except for a shared low-rank projector to align dimensions. To further enhance the representation learning in the fusion module, ADEM-VL introduces a multiscale feature generation scheme which requires only a single forward pass through the vision encoder, avoiding multiple invocations and hence, computational overhead. It achieves this by using pooling operations to generate multiscale visual features from a single set of features. Finally, to prioritize pertinent visual information, an adaptive fusion scheme dynamically discards less relevant visual information for each text token based on its attention score, thus preventing interference from irrelevant information. These three designs work in concert to ensure both parameter and computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. The framework's efficiency is further highlighted by the fact that it adds only one additional [CLS] token to the input, incurring a negligible increase in input length compared to methods that append multiple vision tokens directly in input space.", "first_cons": "While the adaptive fusion mechanism aims to enhance efficiency by discarding less relevant visual features, there's a risk of discarding too much information which might lead to a reduction in the model's capability to capture comprehensive contextual information from the image.", "first_pros": "ADEM-VL significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in the multimodal fusion module, thereby minimizing resource requirements for training and inference.
