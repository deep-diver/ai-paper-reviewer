These limitations stem from the extended input sequences incorporating both language and visual features, which demand more computational operations, and the large number of additional learnable parameters, increasing memory complexity.  The authors emphasize that these challenges severely hinder the broader use of VL models.  The current approaches to multimodal fusion are categorized into two groups: those that fuse visual information into the language model at intermediate layers, introducing substantial additional parameters, and those that directly fuse visual and text information at the input space of the large language model (LLM), demanding massive computational resources and significant memory for the enlarged input sequence.

It tackles the challenges of existing methods that either add many parameters (through cross-attention) or increase computational cost (by extending input sequences). ADEM-VL achieves efficiency through three key innovations: 1) a parameter-free cross-attention mechanism that replaces parameterized similarity measurements with a parameter-free approach, significantly reducing parameters; 2) a multiscale visual feature generation scheme requiring only a single forward pass through the vision encoder to provide rich visual information to the language model; and 3) an adaptive fusion scheme that dynamically discards less relevant visual information based on attention scores, prioritizing the most pertinent features for each text token. These three mechanisms work together to improve efficiency during both training and inference without sacrificing accuracy. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by reformulating the standard cross-attention into an abstract form and replacing parameterized similarity measurement with a parameter-free approach, resulting in significant parameter reduction. Multiscale visual features are generated by pooling and concatenation operations, requiring only a single forward pass through the vision encoder.  An adaptive fusion scheme dynamically discards less relevant visual information, enhancing efficiency by prioritizing the most pertinent visual features. The overall framework integrates these components to achieve superior performance while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference speeds.", "first_cons": "While the proposed parameter-free cross-attention mechanism significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, it still requires a low-rank projector to align dimensions between vision and language features.
