However, it points out the significant limitations imposed by the high computational cost and extensive memory requirements of these models.  These limitations stem from two main factors: the long input sequences needed to incorporate both visual and language features, resulting in increased computational load, and the large number of additional learnable parameters, impacting memory usage.  The introduction then sets the stage for the paper by proposing ADEM-VL, a new efficient vision-language method aiming to address these challenges. ADEM-VL achieves this by leveraging a parameter-free cross-attention mechanism, thus reducing the number of trainable parameters and accelerating both training and inference speeds. The method is also designed to enhance the fusion process using a multiscale feature generation scheme and an adaptive fusion strategy that selectively prioritizes the most relevant visual features.

Regarding multimodal architectures, it categorizes existing approaches into two main groups: those that fuse visual information into the LLM at intermediate layers (using cross-attention mechanisms, often adding many parameters) and those that fuse in the input space (by concatenating visual features with text, increasing input sequence length, and thus computational cost).  The section highlights the limitations of both approaches: high parameter count or increased computational complexity.  In the area of PEFT for LLMs, the authors divide techniques into those that don't introduce new trainable parameters (e.g., BitFit) and those that do (e.g., Adapter, LoRA), pointing out that most PEFT methods for language models can be applied to multimodal architectures but often fall short in fully integrating visual information or fail to optimize for computational efficiency in multimodal scenarios.  The section concludes by emphasizing the gap in developing methods that achieve both parameter and computational efficiency in multimodal fusion, which is the motivation for the authors' proposed approach.", "first_cons": "The categorization of multimodal architectures is somewhat broad and could be made more nuanced by considering specific architectural choices within each category.

It starts by simplifying the standard cross-attention module, replacing its parameterized similarity measurement with a parameter-free approach using the SiLU activation function. This significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, enhancing efficiency. To improve the representation learning of this parameter-free module, the framework incorporates a multiscale visual information generation scheme, employing pooling operations to create visual features at different scales from a single forward pass through the vision encoder.  This avoids the computational burden of multiple forward passes. Finally, an adaptive fusion scheme dynamically discards less relevant visual information for each text token based on its attention score, ensuring the model focuses on the most pertinent visual features.
