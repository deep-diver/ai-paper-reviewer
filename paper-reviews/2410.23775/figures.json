It showcases three distinct tasks: portrait photography, font design, and home decor.  For each task, four images were generated simultaneously using a single diffusion process. Importantly, separate IC-LoRA models were trained for each task using a small dataset (20-100 samples) of task-specific examples. The figure highlights the capability of IC-LoRA to generate high-fidelity images while requiring only minimal tuning for each task.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2410.23775/x14.png", "caption": "Figure 2: In-Context LoRA Generation Examples. Three tasks from top to bottom: sandstorm visual effect, portrait illustration, and visual identity design. For each task, an image pair is generated simultaneously within a single diffusion process.

Three distinct tasks are shown: applying a sandstorm effect to an existing image, transforming a photograph into an illustration, and creating a visual identity (logo and application) for a brand.  Each task involves generating two images simultaneously using a single diffusion process.  The method leverages In-Context LoRA to adapt pre-trained models with minimal tuning, requiring only a small dataset.  The figure highlights the model's ability to generate coherent, high-quality results across diverse tasks, and previews the later discussion of using SDEdit for image-conditional generation.", "section": "Results"}]
