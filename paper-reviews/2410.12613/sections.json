To better understand the potential of merging any two models, the authors propose the metric 'Model Kinship', which quantifies the degree of similarity between models based on their parameter weights (or changes in weights).  This concept is directly inspired by the notion of kinship in evolutionary biology.

The greedy strategy shows rapid initial improvement in average task performance, reaching 68.72 by generation 2, but then plateaus, indicating it has fallen into a local optimum. In contrast, the modified strategy, which uses model kinship to guide the selection of models to merge, continues to improve beyond generation 2, reaching a higher average task performance of 69.13 by generation 5. This demonstrates that incorporating model kinship helps the merging process escape local optima and achieve better overall performance.\n\nThe figure illustrates that the greedy approach plateaus at generation 2 while the modified strategy avoids this plateau and continues improving. This is attributed to the use of model kinship as a criterion for model selection, effectively guiding the merging process away from local optima and towards a more globally optimal solution.  The visualization of the model family tree highlights the critical branching point at generation 2 where the strategies diverge.  Additional data in the table supports these results and confirms the performance improvements achieved by the modified strategy across several benchmark tasks. The modified strategy is shown to be more efficient as it is able to continue improving performance after the greedy strategy plateaus. \n\nThe analysis shows a clear correlation between model kinship and the ability to escape local optima during model merging.  The modified strategy's use of model kinship as a selection criterion prevented early saturation and allowed for sustained performance improvement.  This suggests that model kinship is not simply a correlational metric, but rather a causational factor that can actively guide the model merging process toward better generalization. This finding is valuable for improving model merging strategies and avoiding common pitfalls associated with iterative model merging, ultimately leading to more efficient and effective large language model development.
