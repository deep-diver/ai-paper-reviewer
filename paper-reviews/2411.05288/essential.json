However, current methods often suffer from **imbalanced computation and memory usage across pipeline stages**, leading to reduced efficiency. This imbalance is particularly pronounced in vocabulary layers, which are responsible for mapping words to their numerical representations.  Existing solutions, like layer redistribution, have limited success and may even worsen the problem. \nThis research introduces Vocabulary Parallelism, a novel approach to overcome this limitation.  **By evenly distributing the vocabulary layers across pipeline devices and optimizing communication**, the method effectively balances computation and memory usage. Experiments show significant performance gains (5%-51% improvement) with reduced memory consumption, especially for models with large vocabularies. The technique is also adaptable to various existing pipeline scheduling strategies, enhancing its practicality and potential impact on large-scale model training.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}}
