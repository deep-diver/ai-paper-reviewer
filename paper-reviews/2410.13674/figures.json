DisCL consists of two phases: (Phase 1) Syn-to-Real Data Generation and (Phase 2) Generative Curriculum learning. In Phase 1, we use a pretrained model to identify the \"hard\" samples in the original images and use them as guidance to generate a full spectrum of synthetic to real images by varying image guidance strength \u03bb. In Phase 2, a curriculum strategy (Non-Adaptive or Adaptive) selects training data from the full spectrum, by determining the image guidance level for each training stage e. Synthetic data of the selected guidance level is then combined with non-hard real samples to train the task model.", "description": "This figure illustrates the two phases of the Diffusion Curriculum
