Classical data augmentation methods are deemed insufficient to significantly enhance data diversity. The introduction then positions diffusion models as a promising solution, capable of generating high-quality and diverse synthetic data through text-guided prompts. However, it points out a crucial limitation: text-only guidance often leads to synthetic images that are not sufficiently similar to real training data, resulting in out-of-distribution issues which reduce model performance.  The core problem addressed in the paper is the need for a mechanism to control the visual similarity between the real and synthetic images which is tackled by leveraging image guidance techniques.  The introduction foreshadows a novel 'Diffusion Curriculum Learning' approach to mitigate this issue, which will adaptively adjust the level of image guidance to balance learning difficulty and data diversity, ultimately demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach on long-tail classification and low-quality data scenarios.", "first_cons": "The introduction primarily focuses on the problems associated with real-world data for training machine learning models and offers little insight into the existing solutions or their limitations.", "first_pros": "The introduction clearly defines the core problem and successfully sets the stage for the proposed solution, motivating readers to delve deeper into the paper.", "keypoints": ["Low-quality or scarce data significantly challenge deep neural network training.", "Classical data augmentation is inadequate to address data diversity.", "Diffusion models offer a potential for generating high-quality synthetic data.", "Text-only guidance in diffusion models leads to out-of-distribution synthetic data.", "Image guidance allows for better control of synthetic data's similarity to real data."], "second_cons": "The introduction lacks specific quantitative data to support its claims about the severity of data quality and quantity issues in practical machine learning scenarios.", "second_pros": "The introduction's concise writing style and clear problem statement make it easily accessible to readers from various machine learning backgrounds, facilitating a seamless transition into the technical details of the paper.", "summary": "This paper addresses the challenges of training deep neural networks with low-quality and scarce real-world data.

Phase 1, *Synthetic-to-Real Data Generation*, begins by identifying 'hard samples' from the original training data, using a task-specific method like evaluating loss or confidence for low-quality datasets or focusing on tail classes for long-tail classification.  Then, using a pretrained diffusion model (Stable Diffusion), synthetic images are created for these hard samples using a modified denoising process that incorporates a parameter \u03bb (lambda) controlling the level of image guidance. \u03bb ranges from 0 (purely text-guided) to 1 (fully image-guided), allowing for a spectrum of synthetic images ranging from prototypical (\u03bb = 0) to very similar to the original (\u03bb = 1). To mitigate low-fidelity results, a CLIPScore is used to filter images. Phase 2, *Generative Curriculum Learning*, selects training data from the generated spectrum based on chosen curriculum strategies.  A *Non-Adaptive Curriculum* uses a predefined sequence of \u03bb values for training stages (e.g., starting with lower \u03bb for greater diversity and progressing to higher \u03bb for task-specific features), while an *Adaptive Curriculum* dynamically chooses the \u03bb value that results in the greatest improvement during training. The chosen curriculum, combined with real non-hard samples, is then used to train the model.
