However, text-only guidance is insufficient for controlling the synthetic images' similarity to the original images, potentially leading to out-of-distribution data that harms model performance.  The authors propose using image guidance in diffusion models to create a spectrum of interpolations between synthetic and real images. This spectrum allows for a more controlled generation of synthetic data, addressing the limitations of text-only guidance.

A higher \u03bb value results in synthetic images closer to the original real images while lower \u03bb values lead to more diverse synthetic data. To ensure image quality and relevance, CLIPScore is used to filter out low-fidelity synthetic images.  Phase 2, *Generative Curriculum Learning*, describes the strategies for selecting the best guidance level for each training stage and using the generated synthetic data combined with non-hard real samples to improve model training.

In long-tail classification, DisCL addresses the class imbalance by creating a curriculum that begins with diverse synthetic images of tail classes (those with fewer samples) generated with lower image guidance (\u03bb \u2192 0). This increases the diversity and quantity of data for these underrepresented classes.  The curriculum then gradually increases the image guidance, bringing the synthetic images closer to the real images, bridging the synthetic-to-real gap. For learning from low-quality data, the approach focuses on generating synthetic data that is easier to learn, with lower guidance, yet still captures the prototypical features of the target classes. The authors propose two curricula: a non-adaptive 'Diverse-to-Specific' curriculum that progresses from lower to higher guidance, and an adaptive curriculum that dynamically selects the guidance level based on model performance.  Experiments are conducted on the ImageNet-LT and iWildCam datasets, respectively.
