The core idea is to generate a range of synthetic training images, starting from completely artificial ones and gradually transitioning to images that closely resemble real-world images. This is achieved using \"image-guided diffusion models,\" which allow for greater control over the generated images.  They tested this approach on two challenging tasks: long-tail classification (where some categories have much less data than others) and low-quality image learning (where the input images are blurry or noisy). DisCL significantly improved the accuracy of AI models on both of these tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.  The study also showed that a dynamic or \"adaptive\" curriculum, where the type of synthetic image used is adjusted during training, works particularly well when using low-quality images, offering a more robust learning process."}
