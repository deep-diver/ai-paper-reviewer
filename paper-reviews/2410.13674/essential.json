DisCL uses a technique called image-guided diffusion to create synthetic training images that smoothly transition from purely synthetic (generated from text descriptions only) to images very similar to real-world training images.  The approach offers a range of image quality that can be used to make a curriculum, improving training efficiency and the model's ability to learn from difficult examples. Experiments show that DisCL significantly improves the accuracy of models on long-tail image classification (where some classes have many more examples than others) and in situations where the training data is noisy or of lower quality. The method demonstrates the successful use of synthetic data generation and curriculum learning to enhance deep learning model performance."}
