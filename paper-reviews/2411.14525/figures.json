It shows the distribution of datasets across different modalities (CT, MRI, CT&PET, Ultrasound), body regions (Head and Neck, Thoracic, Abdominal, Pelvic, Limb, Other), and dataset sizes (Small, Medium, Large).  The pie charts illustrate the proportions of datasets categorized by modality and size, respectively. The circular graphic displays the different datasets, grouping them by the body region they cover, and uses color-coding to represent the imaging modality. This visualization helps to understand the diversity and scale of the datasets used in the benchmark.", "section": "2 Materials and Methods"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14525/extracted/6016375/image/modality.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Numbers of datasets with different modalities.", "description": "This figure shows a pie chart that presents the number of datasets used in the study, broken down by imaging modality.  The modalities included are CT, MRI, CT&PET (combined CT and PET scans), and Ultrasound. The sizes of the slices in the pie chart are proportional to the number of datasets using each modality.", "section": "2 Materials and Methods"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.14525/extracted/6016375/image/size.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Proportions of datasets in different scales.", "description": "This figure shows the distribution of the 87 datasets used in the study across three different size categories: small, medium, and large.

The DSC, a common metric for evaluating segmentation performance, is shown separately for various scales (small, base, large, and huge) of the STU-Net model.  The violin plot's shape illustrates the distribution of DSC scores for each model size and helps to reveal trends in performance variation across the datasets and model sizes. It aids in comparing the performance with and without pre-training across different model scales. ", "section": "3.1 Overall Performance"}]
