The first stage utilizes supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to train the model to generate high-quality prompts from freestyle inputs.  Crucially, this stage emphasizes rewriting prompts to maximize effective communication with downstream components.  The second stage introduces ModelTokens, a novel approach for model selection, effectively embedding model representations within the MLLM's vocabulary, and enabling efficient and accurate model selection. This avoids the drawbacks of previous methods, including performance bottlenecks, and maintains prompt generation quality.  Finally, the third stage leverages the model's in-context learning capability to configure optimal arguments, guided by the previously determined prompt and model, eliminating the need for additional training data at this step.  **This multi-stage approach is key to ChatGen-Evo's success**, as it allows for focused training and avoids the complexities of tackling the entire task at once, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods."}}, {"heading_title": "Ablation Studies: Key Insights", "details": {"summary": "Ablation studies in the context of automatic text-to-image (T2I) generation offer critical insights into the individual contributions of different model components.
