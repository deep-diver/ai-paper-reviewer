This limitation hinders progress in various applications, such as video optimization and image enhancement which require precise control over specific areas of an image. This paper introduces SEAGULL, a novel network designed to accurately assess the quality of Regions of Interest (ROIs).  The lack of suitable datasets for this task is another major obstacle.  Existing IQA datasets primarily provide overall quality scores. Thus, SEAGULL also introduces two new datasets to overcome this challenge.\nSEAGULL incorporates a vision-language model (VLM), masks created by the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to specify ROIs, and a meticulously designed Mask-based Feature Extractor (MFE). This innovative approach enables accurate fine-grained IQA for ROIs.  **Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SEAGULL over existing IQA methods**, highlighting its significant advancement in the field of region-level image quality analysis.  The new datasets also contribute substantially to future research by providing more accurate and comprehensive labeling of ROI quality.", "affiliation": "State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence Systems, CASIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Quality Assessment"}, "podcast_path": "2411.10161/podcast.wav"}
