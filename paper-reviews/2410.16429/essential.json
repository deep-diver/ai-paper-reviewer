It provides a better interface than existing systems, allowing machine learning models to more effectively search for and construct mathematical proofs.  Key improvements include support for advanced reasoning steps, more robust handling of complex search scenarios, and efficient extraction of data for training machine learning models.  The authors demonstrate the tool's effectiveness by implementing the 'Draft-Sketch-Proof' approach in Lean 4, a method that first generates a high-level proof outline and then fills in the details. Their experiments show that this approach, using large language models, achieves a notable success rate in proving theorems from the MiniF2F benchmark."}
