It improves the efficiency and effectiveness of proof search by providing a more intuitive interface than existing methods.  This interface allows for the use of advanced reasoning strategies and sophisticated search algorithms. Importantly, Pantograph facilitates the extraction of valuable data for training and improving machine learning models for theorem proving. This data includes complete proof scripts, tactic execution details, and program-like representations of proofs.  The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of Pantograph by applying it to the Draft-Sketch-Proof (DSP) approach, a method for theorem proving that combines high-level reasoning with detailed verification, and achieving a 28% success rate on a benchmark dataset without specialized training. Pantograph's contributions are significant because it addresses the limitations of current interfaces, supports more powerful search algorithms, and provides tools for extracting valuable data, paving the way for future advancements in machine-assisted theorem proving."}
