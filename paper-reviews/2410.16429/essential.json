It overcomes limitations of existing interfaces, enabling more efficient proof search using advanced algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search. Pantograph also supports high-level reasoning by better handling Lean 4's inference steps and provides advanced data extraction capabilities.  A key feature is its support for the Draft-Sketch-Proof (DSP) approach, where a proof outline is created first, then refined step-by-step. The paper showcases Pantograph's capabilities through an illustrative use case, demonstrating its effectiveness in proving Lean 4 theorems using machine learning models and proof sketches.  Overall, Pantograph's innovative features simplify the process of building and evaluating theorem-proving agents, setting the stage for future advancements in automated reasoning."}
