Solving one goal (for instance, assigning a value to the metavariable `\u2461`) automatically updates the others, complicating the proof search process.

Pantograph supports this by using the `have` tactic to introduce lemmas and converting `sorry` placeholders into individual goals for solving.  This method is more intuitive and allows for a top-down approach, but its success relies on the quality of the initial draft and the capability of the tools used to solve the resulting sub-goals."}}, {"page_end_idx": 13, "page_start_idx": 13, "section_number": 5, "section_title": "Evaluation", "details": {"details": "The evaluation section assesses Pantograph's capabilities by replicating a Draft-Sketch-Prove (DSP) experiment from prior work.  Two large language models (LLMs), GPT-4 and GPT-01-preview, were used with specific parameters (max tokens: 2048, top P: 0.95, temperature: 0.8) on the MiniF2F benchmark, a theorem proving evaluation benchmark.  The process involved LLMs generating natural language proofs, then converting these into formal proof sketches in Lean 4.  These sketches, potentially containing placeholders (`sorry` keyword), were fed to Pantograph for resolution using Lean 4 tactics such as `aesop`, `simp`, and `linarith`.  The results, shown in Table 2, reveal a success rate of 28% for the best configuration (GPT-4 with three sketches) on the MiniF2F dataset.  Further analysis (Figure 6 and 7) details the distribution of hammer tactic invocations and runtime across validation and test datasets for both LLMs.  The evaluation concludes with a brief comparison of the results and a note that the main goal was demonstration, not direct comparison with existing Isabelle implementations of DSP.", "first_cons": "The evaluation focuses solely on the MiniF2F benchmark, which limits the generalizability of the results to other theorem proving tasks or datasets.", "first_pros": "The evaluation section presents a clear and replicable experimental setup, using established LLMs and benchmarks, allowing for potential reproducibility by other researchers.", "keypoints": ["The core of the evaluation is a reproduction of a Draft-Sketch-Prove (DSP) experiment from prior work, using two LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-01-preview) on the MiniF2F benchmark.", "The best-performing configuration achieved a 28% success rate in proving theorems.", "The analysis includes detailed plots (Figures 6 and 7) showing the distribution of hammer tactic invocations and runtime for both LLMs.", "The evaluation acknowledges that its primary purpose is demonstration, not direct comparison with existing implementations of DSP in other systems, which is a strength in terms of clarity and focus on Pantograph's specific capabilities within its environment and context.  This means that limitations are acknowledged up front, setting better expectations for readers and avoiding the pitfalls of over-generalizing or misleading comparisons that are common in the field of machine learning.", "The experiment used specific parameters for LLMs (max tokens: 2048, top P: 0.95, temperature: 0.8).", "The results highlight the potential of the system even without specialized training.  The 28% success rate, though modest, indicates that the system can successfully prove a subset of problems within a defined context; this is a significant starting point for future investigation and refinement.  The results show promise and that the system can be improved via parameter tuning, improved LLMs, or additional tactic training.   This sets a strong foundation for future investigation and provides a strong baseline for further development."], "second_cons": "The evaluation does not extensively discuss potential reasons behind the observed success rate (28%), such as limitations of the LLMs or the complexity of the MiniF2F problems.  A deeper dive into these limitations would be beneficial.", "second_pros": "The evaluation provides a clear baseline result that sets a strong foundation for further research. The work has defined a benchmark against which future improvements can be measured, providing a clear and replicable methodology for demonstrating the efficacy of the tool in this specific application.", "summary": "The evaluation section of the paper tests Pantograph using a Draft-Sketch-Prove (DSP) approach on the MiniF2F benchmark.  Two LLMs (GPT-4 and GPT-01-preview) generated natural language proofs which were translated into Lean 4 sketches, subsequently resolved using Pantograph with various Lean tactics. The experiment achieved a 28% success rate in the best configuration, offering a promising baseline for future improvements and further research."}}]
