Furthermore, Pantograph is highlighted for its enhanced data extraction capabilities, enabling the extraction of entire proof scripts with comments, which is useful for tasks such as autoformalization.  Other works such as Lample et al.'s (2022) and-or tree search implementation in Lean 3 and the Draft-Sketch-Prove (DSP) approach are also compared and contrasted with Pantograph, highlighting Pantograph's capabilities in supporting DSP (a technique where a draft proof outline is created first, which is then refined by using machine learning to solve the individual goals), and its design to support efficient tree search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search.", "first_cons": "While comparing Pantograph to other systems, the analysis could benefit from a more quantitative comparison of performance metrics, such as proof success rates or computational efficiency, to better showcase Pantograph's advantages.
