Pantograph supports this by using the `have` tactic to create lemmas and `sorry`-extraction to convert placeholders into goals.  This allows for a more human-like, high-level reasoning process, breaking down complex proofs into smaller, more manageable steps. The success, however, depends on the quality of the initial outline and the ability of tools to solve the resulting subgoals."}}, {"page_end_idx": 14, "page_start_idx": 13, "section_number": 5, "section_title": "Evaluation", "details": {"details": "The evaluation section assesses Pantograph's capabilities by replicating a Draft-Sketch-Proof (DSP) experiment from existing research.  Two large language models (LLMs), GPT-4 and GPT-01-preview, were employed.  The LLMs were tasked with generating natural language proofs for theorems from the MiniF2F benchmark. These natural language proofs were then used to create Lean 4 proof sketches, which were subsequently converted into goals by Pantograph.  Finally, the goals were solved using a combination of Lean 4 tactics, including \\\"aesop\\\", \\\"simp\\\", and \\\"linarith\\\".  The results, shown in Table 2, indicated a 28% success rate using GPT-4 with three sketches, demonstrating a proof success rate of 28% with no specialized training.  Further analysis in Figures 6 and 7 showed the distributions of the number of hammer tactic invocations and runtimes for different models and sketch counts.
