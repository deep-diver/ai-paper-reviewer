However, this faces problems like causal confusion, where the AI learns the wrong reasons for actions, and the open-loop gap, where small errors add up over time. Real-world testing is unsafe and costly, while existing simulated environments lack realism, hindering effective training and safety. To tackle these challenges, the paper introduces a new approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to improve end-to-end autonomous driving, aiming to overcome the limitations of IL by enabling safer and more robust training. \n\nThis paper presents RAD, a new method that uses **3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)** to create detailed, realistic digital driving environments. This allows AD policies to explore many situations and learn from trial and error safely. RAD also includes specialized rewards to teach the AI to handle critical safety events and understand real-world causes and effects. To make the AI drive more like humans, imitation learning is used as a regular part of the RL training. The method is tested in new 3DGS environments, showing it performs better than IL-based methods, with a collision rate three times lower.
