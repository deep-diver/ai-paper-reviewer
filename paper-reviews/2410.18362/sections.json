It addresses two key challenges: teaching models to understand HTML structure and learning subtle visual differences between UI images.  To address the first challenge, WAFFLE introduces a structure-aware attention mechanism that allows tokens in the HTML code to focus on their parents, siblings, and themselves.  This mechanism explicitly uses knowledge of the hierarchical structure of HTML. For the second challenge, WAFFLE employs contrastive learning, using a mutated HTML dataset created from WebSight-v0.1. This involves creating four mutants for each sample in the dataset, based on common failure categories observed in existing models.  The contrastive learning objective aims to maximize the similarity between image and HTML code embeddings by minimizing a contrastive loss function, coupled with a standard language modeling loss. The approach integrates both the structure-aware attention and contrastive learning within a joint optimization framework, with a hyperparameter controlling the relative importance of each.  A new dataset of 57,985 image-HTML code pairs was created for training and evaluation using this method. The architecture also includes vision and language modeling components.", "first_cons": "The approach relies on a manually created mutated dataset which could introduce bias or inconsistencies.", "first_pros": "The structure-aware attention mechanism directly addresses the hierarchical nature of HTML, a significant improvement over standard methods.", "keypoints": ["Structure-aware attention mechanism focusing on parent, sibling, and self-attention for HTML structure learning.", "Contrastive learning using a mutated dataset (57,985 image-HTML code pairs) to learn subtle visual differences.", "Joint optimization framework combining structure-aware attention and contrastive learning.", "Creation of a new dataset for improved training and evaluation."], "second_cons": "The effectiveness of the hyperparameter balancing the structure-aware attention and contrastive learning might depend on the specific model and dataset.", "second_pros": "The approach is model-independent, suggesting broader applicability to various MLLMs.", "summary": "WAFFLE's approach uses a two-pronged strategy to improve UI image-to-HTML code generation.

It begins by describing the model training process, specifying that the WAFFLE approach is implemented on two backbone models, VLM-WebSight and Moondream2.  Both models are initially fine-tuned on the WebSight-v0.1 dataset using a standard language modeling objective with the AdamW optimizer and a learning rate of 3e-5.  Following this initial fine-tuning, the structure-aware attention and contrastive learning components of WAFFLE are applied.  The structure-aware attention mechanism is implemented on 1/4 of the attention heads in the language model decoder.  The combined objective function is minimized using the AdamW optimizer with a learning rate of 2e-5. Two test datasets are then described: WebSight-Test, a synthetic dataset containing 500 samples, and Design2Code, a more complex real-world dataset with 484 samples.  These datasets are used to evaluate the performance of the WAFFLE model, comparing it against standard fine-tuning methods and also against state-of-the-art commercial models such as GPT-40 mini, GPT-40, and Gemini 1.5 Pro via prompting.
