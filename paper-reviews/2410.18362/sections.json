It emphasizes the complexity inherent in HTML's hierarchical structure and styling, posing difficulties for both novice and experienced developers. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, two major obstacles remain in UI-to-HTML conversion: effectively representing HTML's hierarchical structure for LLMs and bridging the visual nature of UI designs with HTML's text-based format.  The introduction sets the stage for the paper by introducing WAFFLE, a new fine-tuning strategy designed to overcome these challenges.  WAFFLE leverages a structure-aware attention mechanism to enhance LLMs' understanding of HTML structure and employs contrastive fine-tuning to align LLMs' understanding of UI images and HTML code.

It focuses on two key challenges: teaching models to understand HTML structure and learning the subtle differences in UI images corresponding to code changes. To tackle these, WAFFLE introduces three main components: \n\n1. **Data Mutation**:  Augmenting the WebSight-v0.1 dataset by creating four distinct mutants for 100,000 samples using seven categories of mutation rules derived from a failure analysis of an existing MLLM. This creates a contrastive learning dataset highlighting subtle visual differences linked to code variations.\n2. **Structure-Aware Attention**: A novel attention mechanism that focuses on three types of code segments (parent, sibling, and self) to improve understanding of HTML's hierarchical structure. It enhances the focus on structurally important parts of the code, improving accuracy and reducing sensitivity to insignificant alterations.\n3. **Contrastive Learning**: Employing contrastive learning to align the model's understanding of UI images and HTML code. This helps the model focus on important visual differences caused by small code changes, improving accuracy on subtle visual variations.  The loss function incorporates both contrastive loss and standard language modeling loss, jointly optimizing both objectives.", "first_cons": "The reliance on a manually created mutation dataset, albeit based on a failure analysis, could introduce bias and limit the generalizability of WAFFLE to datasets with different characteristics or error patterns. The process might not scale efficiently to larger datasets.", "first_pros": "The use of contrastive learning is a significant strength, directly addressing the challenge of aligning the model's understanding of visual and textual representations. This leads to improved accuracy in handling subtle visual differences that are significant in the code generation task.", "keypoints": ["WAFFLE uses a three-pronged approach: data mutation, structure-aware attention, and contrastive learning.", "Data mutation creates 4 mutants from 100,000 WebSight-v0.1 samples, resulting in a large contrastive learning dataset.", "Structure-aware attention focuses on parent, sibling, and self-attention to understand HTML structure better.", "Contrastive learning aligns the model's understanding of UI images and HTML code, improving sensitivity to subtle differences."], "second_cons": "The structure-aware attention mechanism is specific to the HTML structure and might require adaptation for other programming languages, thereby reducing the model's transferability to other domains.", "second_pros": "The introduction of structure-aware attention is a novel contribution. It effectively captures the structural relationships within HTML code, which is crucial for accurate generation, leading to better understanding of hierarchical relationships in the code.", "summary": "WAFFLE's approach enhances MLLMs for UI-to-HTML code generation by using a three-part strategy:  mutating the WebSight-v0.1 dataset to create a contrastive learning dataset that highlights important visual differences, implementing structure-aware attention to focus on parent, sibling, and self code segments improving HTML structure understanding, and using contrastive learning to better align the model's visual and textual understanding of the data.
