The plot shows the relationships between image embeddings (red circles) and text embeddings (blue triangles). In the Standard FT plot (a), image and text embeddings are far apart, indicating a lack of alignment between visual and textual understanding. In contrast, the WAFFLE-attn plot (b) shows a much closer grouping of image and text embeddings, demonstrating that the WAFFLE-attn method effectively aligns the model's understanding of visual and textual data.", "section": "4.2 Ablation Studies"}]
