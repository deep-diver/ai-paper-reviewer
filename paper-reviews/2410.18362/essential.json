The core challenge is that website code has a complex structure and style that's hard for AI to grasp from a visual image. WAFFLE addresses this by using two main techniques:  First, it uses a 'structure-aware attention mechanism' to help the AI understand how different parts of the HTML code relate to each other.  Second, it uses 'contrastive learning' to teach the AI to better connect what it sees in a website's image with the correct code.  The results show that WAFFLE significantly outperforms existing AI models in accurately creating HTML code from UI images, demonstrating substantial progress in automated front-end web development.  This is important because building websites is complex, even for experienced developers, and this research could greatly assist both beginners and experts."}
