It highlights the transformative impact of unsupervised pretraining in supervised learning domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, where pretrained models significantly improve learning efficiency with limited task-specific data. However, the authors emphasize that RL presents a unique challenge, as fine-tuning does not involve mimicking task-specific data but rather actively exploring and locating solutions through iterative self-improvement.  The core challenge identified is developing exploration strategies that effectively utilize abundant but unlabeled trajectory data, which is often the most readily available data source in RL scenarios.  The paper introduces the 'entanglement problem' where general knowledge of the environment is mixed with task-specific behavior. The authors propose to alleviate this problem through a hierarchical decomposition approach: breaking down trajectories into task-agnostic skills that can be composed in various ways to solve diverse objectives.  This is the foundation for their novel approach, which promises to improve exploration speed and efficiency in complex RL environments.

The objective is to learn a policy \u03c0(a|s) that maximizes the cumulative reward \u03b7(\u03c0), calculated as the expected discounted sum of rewards.  Crucially, the reward function (r) is unknown during the initial unsupervised learning phase; only during the online phase does the agent receive reward signals from interacting with the environment.

Offline, it uses a variational autoencoder (VAE) to extract low-level skills from trajectory segments of length H.  It then creates a trajectory segment encoder to encode the trajectory segments.  Online, it trains a high-level off-policy RL agent to compose these skills to explore efficiently.  This is done using an optimistic reward model to pseudo-relabel past trajectories, transforming prior data into high-level, task-relevant examples which are used as additional off-policy data for online reinforcement learning. The high-level policy is trained to select the pretrained low-level skills to explore effectively, guided by the optimistic reward estimates and updated with new observations during online interaction. The optimistic reward module is updated with online experience. The method uses both prior data and online replay buffer to learn a high-level policy.  The algorithm is outlined in Algorithm 1.

The AntMaze task involves navigating a robot to a goal location in a maze of varying complexities.  The Kitchen task requires a robot arm to complete four tasks sequentially, and Visual AntMaze presents a similar navigation task but with image observations instead of state-based.  The experiments focus on whether leveraging unlabeled prior trajectory data can accelerate online learning. Three key questions are investigated:  Can unsupervised trajectory skills accelerate online learning? Can SUPE find goals faster than prior methods?  Does offline data help SUPE compose skills better for exploration? The results show that SUPE consistently outperforms other methods in terms of normalized return across all tasks.  The analysis includes various baselines like online learning with and without skill pretraining, showing the effectiveness of both offline and online utilization of prior data.  Specific metrics, such as the average number of steps to reach the goal and coverage, are also reported to thoroughly assess the impact of prior data on exploration and learning efficiency.
