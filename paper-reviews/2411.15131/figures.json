Panel (a) details the WildLMa-Skill module, illustrating how task-specific text and visual observations are processed using a frozen CLIP model to generate cross-attention maps for improved skill generalizability.  Panel (b) displays the physical robot platform, which consists of a Unitree B1 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 arm and a 3D-printed gripper. The robot is further outfitted with two RGB-D cameras and a LiDAR sensor for comprehensive environmental perception.", "section": "III.

Given a constructed hierarchical scene graph, WildLMa-planner adopts a coarse-to-fine searching mechanism to determine node traversal and structured actions to take.", "description": "WildLMa-Planner uses a hierarchical scene graph to plan long-horizon tasks.  The coarse planner receives high-level instructions (e.g., \"clean the trash\") and breaks them down into subtasks (e.g., \"navigate to hallway\", \"pick up trash\", \"place trash in bin\").  The fine-grained planner then uses a breadth-first search to find the optimal sequence of skills from the WildLMa-Skill library to achieve each subtask, considering node locations and object information. This two-level planning approach allows for more efficient and robust task execution.", "section": "III. METHOD"}]
