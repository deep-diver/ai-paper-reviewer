The core idea is to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to represent objects in videos as a collection of 3D Gaussians, thus capturing their 3D states and enabling tracking of their motion in a particle-based fashion.  These 3D Gaussian representations are then used to train a neural dynamics model, specifically using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), on real-world robot-object interaction data. The GNN model learns to predict the motions of objects under various initial configurations and unseen robot actions, directly from the sparse control particles downsampled from the densely tracked 3D Gaussian reconstructions. The predicted motions of control particles can then be interpolated to achieve dense motion prediction for the 3D Gaussians, leading to action-conditioned video prediction.  Importantly, this model can be applied to model-based planning frameworks for robot object manipulation.", "first_cons": "The method relies on dense 3D tracking from multi-view videos, which can be challenging and computationally expensive.

Regarding dense correspondence, the authors highlight the limitations of traditional 2D pixel-wise tracking methods, noting their reliance on large datasets and their inherent difficulty in handling 3D information crucial for robotic applications.
