This leads to performance bottlenecks and difficulty handling diverse real-world scenarios. The paper introduces several key innovations that improve the capabilities of GUI interaction, enhancing perception and grounding abilities.  \n\nThe proposed solution, UI-TARS, uses a native GUI agent model that solely relies on screenshots as input.  This **end-to-end model** achieves state-of-the-art performance in several benchmarks.  The model incorporates **enhanced perception**, **unified action modeling**, **system-2 reasoning**, and **iterative training with reflective online traces** to overcome the data bottleneck and improve accuracy.  The open-sourcing of UI-TARS allows for further research and development in the field.", "affiliation": "ByteDance Seed, Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Human-AI Interaction"}, "podcast_path": "2501.12326/podcast.wav"}
