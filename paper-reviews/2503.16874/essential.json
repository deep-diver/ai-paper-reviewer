To address these challenges, this paper proposes MARS: a Multi-Agent framework Incorporating Socratic guidance. MARS utilizes multi-agent collaboration for planning and iterative refinement to break free from cognitive biases. \n\nMARS employs seven distinct agents, including a Planner for autonomous pathfinding and a Teacher-Critic-Student model for Socratic dialogue-based optimization. This setup facilitates iterative prompt refinement, enhancing search efficiency. The method demonstrates improved performance across diverse datasets. The framework's design emphasizes flexibility and incorporates interpretability, outperforming other APO techniques and demonstrating advancements in prompt optimization and multi-agent collaboration.", "affiliation": "Xi'an Jiaotong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16874/podcast.wav"}
