Existing attempts to accelerate this by generating multiple tokens simultaneously fail to accurately capture the output distribution, limiting their effectiveness. This paper tackles this challenge head-on.\nThe proposed Distilled Decoding (DD) method leverages flow matching to create a deterministic mapping from a Gaussian distribution to the output distribution of a pre-trained AR model.  A separate network is then trained to learn this mapping, enabling few-step generation. Crucially, DD's training doesn't need the original AR model's data, making it practical. Experiments showcase promising results, achieving substantial speed-ups on various image AR models with acceptable fidelity loss.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.17153/podcast.wav"}
