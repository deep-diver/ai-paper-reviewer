These limitations hinder the generation of high-fidelity videos, creating a gap between reconstruction and generation quality.  Additionally, defining an efficient sequential order for tokens remains a challenge.\n\nThe paper introduces LARP, a novel video tokenizer, to overcome these limitations. **LARP employs a holistic tokenization scheme using learned queries to capture global context, offering flexibility in token numbers.**  It integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that enhances AR-friendliness of the latent space. **Experimental results show LARP outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art FVD scores in video generation benchmarks.** This demonstrates LARP's effectiveness in generating high-quality videos and its suitability for integration into more complex MLLMs."}
