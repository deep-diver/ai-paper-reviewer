[{"heading_title": "ODS: Open Search", "details": {"summary": "Open Deep Search (ODS) is introduced as an **open-source** search solution aimed at bridging the gap between proprietary AI search tools and their open-source counterparts. The core innovation lies in augmenting open-source LLMs with reasoning agents capable of judiciously utilizing web search tools for query answering. ODS comprises two main components: the Open Search Tool and the Open Reasoning Agent, both designed to work with a user-selected base LLM. The Open Reasoning Agent interprets tasks and orchestrates actions, including calling upon the novel Open Search Tool. This new search tool outperforms proprietary tools in web searches, achieving strong performance with powerful open-source reasoning LLMs like DeepSeek-R1. ODS as a framework, is created to seamlessly augment any LLMs with search and reasoning capabilities, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in benchmarks like SimpleQA and FRAMES. This effort promotes transparency, fosters innovation, and empowers entrepreneurs in the search AI space."}}, {"heading_title": "Reasoning Agents", "details": {"summary": "**Reasoning agents** are pivotal in augmenting LLMs for sophisticated search, as highlighted in the paper. They enable LLMs to surpass proprietary solutions by orchestrating sequences of actions involving tools like web search. The architecture involves interpreting queries, assessing context, and utilizing appropriate tools, enhancing overall performance. The paper explores both ReAct and CodeAct-based agents, showcasing versatility. Reasoning enhances the LLM's ability to understand complex prompts and perform multiple-step retrievals leading to better answers. The agents' adaptability allows them to handle varying tasks efficiently, contributing to the state-of-the-art performance achieved by the system. These agents also are responsible for tool selection for instance, choosing whether to use a calculator tool or continuing reasoning. "}}, {"heading_title": "Search Tooling", "details": {"summary": "Search tools are indispensable for augmenting large language models (LLMs), providing real-time information access. **Closed-source solutions** dominate, hindering transparency. Open-source alternatives exist but face challenges in query processing, snippet relevance, and context extraction. Effective search tooling requires sophisticated query rephrasing, reliable source prioritization, and content filtering. **Agentic frameworks** can intelligently leverage search tools, adaptively selecting queries and integrating retrieved information. By promoting open-source development, we can foster innovation, democratize access, and mitigate the risks associated with proprietary systems. "}}, {"heading_title": "CodeAct Agents", "details": {"summary": "The 'CodeAct Agents' section discusses employing executable Python code for tool calling. This method significantly enhances performance compared to JSON-based approaches. LLMs can compress the action-space using code, **making it naturally suited for action taking**. Code is composable, modularized, and generalized more easily than JSON, **simplifying complex tasks**. By using CodeAct Agents, Open Deep Search customizes tools such as SmolAgents to search the web. CodeAgent's search tool allows for seamless customization and distribution."}}, {"heading_title": "Dynamic Prompts", "details": {"summary": "Dynamic few-shot learning with ReAct leverages demonstrative examples to guide reasoning. **The system optimizes prompt efficiency via vector similarity matching**, retrieving relevant examples and maintaining performance while reducing complexity. A community campaign designed 200 ReAct prompts, **incorporating diverse intuitions** resulting in substantially improved ReAct agent performance. Examples are included in Appendix B."}}]
