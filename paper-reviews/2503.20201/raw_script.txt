[{"Alex": "Hey podcast listeners, ready to ditch those clunky, closed-off search tools? Today, we're diving deep into a game-changer: Open Deep Search, or ODS. Think democratized search, open-source power, and reasoning agents that are, frankly, kinda mind-blowing. Stick around, because we're about to unlock the secrets of search AI \u2013 no PhD required!", "Jamie": "Sounds awesome, Alex! I'm Jamie, and I'm super curious. So, ODS\u2026 open-source search? What exactly does that *mean* in everyday terms? I\u2019m used to Google and the usual suspects."}, {"Alex": "Great question, Jamie! Basically, imagine if the super-smart AI behind tools like Perplexity and even OpenAI\u2019s new search features was\u2026well, open. Anyone could peek under the hood, tweak it, and build on it. That's ODS. It's about putting that power in the hands of developers and researchers, not just big corporations.", "Jamie": "Okay, I get the open-source bit. But these 'reasoning agents' you mentioned? They sound like something out of a sci-fi movie!"}, {"Alex": "Haha, well, they're not quite robots\u2026 *yet*. But they are seriously clever bits of code. Think of them as tiny digital detectives. They interpret your search query, figure out the best tools to use \u2013 including a super-smart web search tool we built \u2013 and then orchestrate a whole sequence of actions to get you the best possible answer.", "Jamie": "So, it\u2019s more than just typing a question into a search bar? It\u2019s actually\u2026thinking?"}, {"Alex": "Exactly! These agents can rephrase your query if it's vague, extract relevant snippets from websites, and even filter out the junk. It\u2019s all about understanding what you *really* want to know.", "Jamie": "Hmm, that sounds complicated. How does it actually *work*? Like, what are the key pieces that make ODS tick?"}, {"Alex": "Well, there are two main parts. First, the Open Search Tool \u2013 that\u2019s our super-smart web search component. It's designed to outperform even the proprietary tools. Then there's the Open Reasoning Agent, which comes in two flavors, ReAct and CodeAct. These agents decide what to *do* with the search results.", "Jamie": "ReAct and CodeAct? What\u2019s the difference? I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s not about acting on a stage\u2026"}, {"Alex": "You got it! ReAct is all about 'Reasoning and Acting' \u2013 it thinks step-by-step, like a detective piecing together clues. CodeAct, on the other hand, leverages code to be more efficient in tool usage. It\u2019s better for certain types of complex queries. Think of ReAct as the careful planner and CodeAct as the quick problem solver.", "Jamie": "So, it\u2019s like having two different brains working on the search? How did you guys actually test this thing? What kind of results did you get?"}, {"Alex": "That's where things get really exciting! We put ODS through its paces on two popular benchmarks: SimpleQA and FRAMES. SimpleQA is all about factuality, while FRAMES tests reasoning and retrieval across multiple sources.", "Jamie": "And\u2026did it pass the test? Don\u2019t leave me hanging, Alex!"}, {"Alex": "It didn't just pass \u2013 it *aced* it! Using ODS with the open-source DeepSeek-R1 model, we matched or even *surpassed* state-of-the-art closed-source solutions like Perplexity's Sonar Reasoning Pro and even OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o Search Preview on FRAMES", "Jamie": "Wow, that's impressive! Especially beating out GPT-4o, which is the new cool kid. But what about SimpleQA? I\u2019m assuming it didn\u2019t do *as* well?"}, {"Alex": "Interestingly, the results varied. On SimpleQA, ODS came really close, but GPT-4o still had a slight edge. However, on FRAMES, our ODS beat GPT-4o Search Preview by a whopping 9.7% in accuracy!", "Jamie": "That's huge! Why the difference in performance between the two benchmarks?"}, {"Alex": "We believe it highlights ODS's strength in complex reasoning and integrating information from multiple sources, exactly what FRAMES tests. SimpleQA, being more focused on direct fact retrieval, may benefit from the vast knowledge already embedded in models like GPT-4o.", "Jamie": "Hmm, so ODS is really good at connecting the dots when the answer isn\u2019t obvious."}, {"Alex": "Exactly! And that's where the Open Reasoning Agent really shines. It can sift through conflicting information, prioritize reliable sources, and even use external tools like Wolfram Alpha for calculations.", "Jamie": "External tools? Like, it can use a calculator if it needs to? That's pretty neat!"}, {"Alex": "Absolutely! One example from the paper showed ODS correctly calculating the age difference between two people using Wolfram Alpha, while other AI models got confused by potential answers.", "Jamie": "So, it\u2019s not just regurgitating facts, it\u2019s actually processing information and\u2026reasoning! That sounds incredibly useful, especially with all the misinformation out there."}, {"Alex": "That's the goal! We also found that ODS is able to adapt to the quality of the initial search results. If it needs to, it uses extra search, but it also has a way to judge the quality of the search. ", "Jamie": "That's pretty smart, knowing when to use more search or not. How could a regular developer use this in their own project? I suppose they'd want to take it to the next level."}, {"Alex": "That's the beauty of open source, Jamie. You can find the entire codebase on GitHub. It's designed to be plug-and-play, so you can seamlessly integrate ODS with any base LLM you choose, open-source or through an API.", "Jamie": "So, I could use it with, say, Llama or DeepSeek? Or even hook it up to a closed-source model like GPT-4 if I have access?"}, {"Alex": "Precisely! And you can tweak the reasoning agents, add your own tools, or even build completely new search applications on top of it. The possibilities are pretty endless.", "Jamie": "This sounds like it could seriously shake up the search AI landscape. What are some of the limitations, though?"}, {"Alex": "Well, like any AI system, ODS is only as good as the data it's trained on and the models it uses. We're also constantly working on improving its robustness against biases and misinformation.", "Jamie": "Okay, that makes sense. So what\u2019s next for ODS? Where do you see this going in the future?"}, {"Alex": "We're really hoping to foster a community of developers and researchers who can contribute to ODS, improve its capabilities, and explore new applications. Also, I want to say that the community also helped with some of our ReAct prompts.", "Jamie": "That's cool. That means that the community wants to see ODS be the best it can be! So this might be a weird question but in the future of AI, what place does open-source AI have?"}, {"Alex": "That's not weird at all! Open-source AI is incredibly important, Jamie! It fosters transparency, invites collaborative improvements, and democratizes access to powerful AI tools. It allows us to collectively shape the future of AI in a way that benefits everyone, not just a select few.", "Jamie": "And it can also help avoid those big corporations from monopolizing the AI space, right?"}, {"Alex": "Yes, exactly! And open source helps guarantee that AI benefits the many and not just the few.", "Jamie": "Well, Alex, this has been incredibly insightful. Thanks for demystifying Open Deep Search for me!"}, {"Alex": "My pleasure, Jamie! The key takeaway here is that ODS represents a major step towards democratizing search AI. By providing an open-source framework for building intelligent search agents, we're empowering developers and researchers to innovate and create new search experiences that are more transparent, accessible, and beneficial to everyone. The future of search is open, and it's incredibly exciting!", "Jamie": "I could not agree more!"}]
