Existing methods often struggle with either accuracy or speed. Some approaches prioritize speed, but this often results in lower accuracy. Others sacrifice speed for enhanced accuracy.   \n\nThis research introduces DELTA, a novel method that addresses these issues by combining a reduced-resolution tracking phase with a transformer-based upsampler to achieve high-resolution, accurate predictions.  **DELTA leverages a joint global-local attention mechanism for efficiency and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, outperforming prior methods by a significant margin (more than 8x faster) while maintaining high precision.**  The researchers also demonstrate the superiority of log-depth representation compared to standard Euclidean and inverse depth representations.  These findings offer a highly robust and scalable solution for applications requiring dense and continuous 3D motion tracking.", "affiliation": "UMass Amherst", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}}
