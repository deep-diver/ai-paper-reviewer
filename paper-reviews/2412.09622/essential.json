This necessitates separate training for each concept, hindering efficiency and scalability.  The challenge lies in merging these models while maintaining the quality and distinctness of each individual concept. \nLoRACLR addresses this by introducing a novel approach that merges multiple pre-trained LoRA models using a contrastive objective. This method aligns the weight spaces of individual LoRA models, ensuring compatibility while minimizing interference between concepts.  **LoRACLR achieves scalable model composition**, producing high-quality images with multiple distinct concepts without additional fine-tuning or retraining. **The results demonstrate significant improvements in visual quality and compositional coherence**, showcasing the effectiveness of this method for high-quality multi-concept image synthesis.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.09622/podcast.wav"}
