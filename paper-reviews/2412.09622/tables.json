The models are evaluated on three metrics: Text Alignment, Image Alignment, and Identity Alignment, both before and after merging multiple concepts.  LoRACLR demonstrates competitive performance across all metrics, showing particular improvement in Image and Identity Alignment after the merging process, indicating its ability to successfully integrate multiple concepts while preserving visual fidelity and identity.", "section": "4.

The study asked participants to rate the similarity of generated images to reference images of individual subjects.  Higher scores indicate better preservation of subject identity.
