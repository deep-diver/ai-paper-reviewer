Existing methods often prioritize either geometry or appearance, hindering the creation of versatile, high-quality 3D content.  Additionally, many models require complex pre-processing or are computationally expensive.\nThis paper introduces a novel method that addresses these issues.  It uses a unified latent representation called Structured LATents (SLAT), which integrates a sparsely populated 3D grid with dense visual features to capture both structure and appearance. The researchers trained a 2-billion parameter model using rectified flow transformers to generate SLAT representations and achieved high-quality 3D assets in various formats. The model demonstrated superior performance in flexible editing and outperformed existing models in multiple evaluations.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01506/podcast.wav"}
