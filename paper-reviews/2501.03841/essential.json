While vision-language models (VLMs) excel at high-level reasoning, they lack the fine-grained 3D understanding needed for precise actions.  Fine-tuning VLMs on robotic datasets is costly and limits generalization.  Existing methods that abstract robotic actions into primitives also have limitations, such as task-agnostic proposal generation and reliance on manually designed rules. \nOmniManip tackles these issues by proposing a novel object-centric representation that uses an object's canonical space to define interaction primitives (points and directions).  These primitives, acting as a bridge between high-level reasoning and low-level precision, are translated into 3D spatial constraints.  The system uses a dual closed-loop process: one for high-level planning via primitive resampling and VLM checking, and another for low-level execution via 6D pose tracking.  Extensive experiments demonstrate strong zero-shot generalization, showcasing the method's potential for automating large-scale simulation data generation.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2501.03841/podcast.wav"}
