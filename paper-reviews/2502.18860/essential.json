The exact rewriting approach depends on the use case and application-specific tasks. Two approaches are investigated: **rewriting, which focuses on refining the question, and fusion, which combines elements from previous interactions.** These are evaluated on two fundamentally different generation tasks. \n\nThe paper systematically investigates these approaches on text-to-text and multimodal generation tasks. The results show that the specific approach **depends on the underlying use case and generative task.** Query rewriting works best for conversational question-answering, while query fusion excels for data analysis assistants generating visualizations and data tables.", "affiliation": "Adobe Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2502.18860/podcast.wav"}
