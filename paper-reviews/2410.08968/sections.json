The introduction highlights the limitations of this existing approach, emphasizing the need for a more adaptable and culturally sensitive solution.  The authors point out that what's considered \"safe\" varies significantly; alcohol consumption is legal (with age restrictions) in most Western countries but prohibited in many others, and social norms themselves constantly evolve.  Specific examples are given to illustrate this, such as the different safety needs of video game developers, who may use violent language within a gaming context, and those of harassment training managers, who need to be able to identify various forms of discriminatory language.
