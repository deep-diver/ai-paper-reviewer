{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language model safety and alignment.  It introduces a novel framework for adapting models to diverse safety requirements without retraining, addressing a critical limitation of current one-size-fits-all approaches. The proposed data-centric method and evaluation protocol offer valuable contributions to the field, opening new avenues for research on pluralism and controllability in LLMs.", "summary": "Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA) lets large language models adapt to diverse safety needs at inference time without retraining, boosting practical use.", "takeaways": ["CoSA framework enables adapting LLMs to various safety requirements without retraining by using natural language safety configurations.", "CoSAlign, a data-centric method, improves LLM safety controllability significantly over strong baselines including in-context learning.", "CoSApien benchmark and CoSA-Score evaluation protocol offer reproducible evaluation of controllable safety in LLMs."], "tldr": "This paper introduces Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a novel framework that allows large language models (LLMs) to adapt to diverse safety requirements without the need for retraining.  Instead of a fixed, one-size-fits-all safety approach, CoSA uses natural language descriptions of desired safety behaviors (safety configs) provided in the system prompt.  To achieve this, the authors propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method that trains LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs.  They also develop CoSApien, a benchmark with real-world LLM use cases and diverse safety requirements.  Their experiments show that CoSAlign significantly improves controllability over strong baselines.  CoSA encourages better representation and adaptation to diverse human values, making LLMs more practical and adaptable to varied cultural and social contexts."}
