It addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by proposing a dual evaluation approach.  First, explicit perceptual evaluation uses human feedback on visual quality to assess the realism and fidelity of generated videos. Second, implicit manipulative evaluation assesses how well the generated videos translate into correct control signals in embodied tasks. The research categorizes predictive models based on their level of embodiment, highlighting the progression from text-only to actionable video generation.  Three representative embodied scenarios\u2014open-ended environment, autonomous driving, and robot manipulation\u2014are used for evaluation.  The authors create a new dataset, HF-Embodied, with fine-grained human feedback to support the perceptual evaluation. Results provide insights into the capabilities and limitations of current World Simulators, offering key directions for future research."}
