WorldSimBench employs a two-pronged approach:\n\n1. **Explicit Perceptual Evaluation:** This part assesses the visual realism of the generated videos by using human feedback and a specially trained model to evaluate aspects like visual quality and consistency with given instructions.  A new dataset, HF-Embodied Dataset, was created for this purpose.\n\n2. **Implicit Manipulative Evaluation:** Here, the generated videos are treated as action plans. The model's ability is evaluated by measuring how well the generated videos translate into actual actions within simulated dynamic environments representing three key scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environment, Autonomous Driving, and Robot Manipulation. \n\nThe researchers categorized predictive models hierarchically and found that WorldSimBench provides valuable insights to drive further innovation in this field, pushing the boundaries of embodied AI."}
