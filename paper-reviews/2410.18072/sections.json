It highlights the increasing capabilities of generative models in predicting future states, but notes that these models lack a clear categorization based on their inherent characteristics, hindering progress. Existing benchmarks are deemed insufficient because they fail to thoroughly evaluate the higher-capability, embodied predictive models from an embodied perspective.  The introduction emphasizes that humans make predictions based on their objectives and observations of the current environment, manifesting in various forms like textual planning, visual imagination, or subconscious action-level planning.  The authors argue that generative models are now capable of exhibiting similar predictive capabilities, leading to the completion of embodied tasks via predictions and propose to study such models which are called *Predictive Models*. The introduction introduces the concept of categorizing predictive models based on their embodiment level, going from simple text-based predictions to highly embodied models capable of generating actionable videos.  This hierarchy sets up the foundation for the paper's introduction of WorldSimBench, a new evaluation framework aimed at assessing the capabilities of these advanced, embodied predictive models.

This involves using pre-trained video-to-action models to test video-action consistency within those three scenarios.  The evaluation is done in a closed-loop manner, allowing for the assessment of how well the generated videos translate into actionable control signals.\n\nThis dual approach of visual quality and actionability assessment offers a more robust and holistic evaluation than single-metric approaches often used in the past.
