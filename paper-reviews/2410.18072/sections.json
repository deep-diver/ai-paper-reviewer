It begins by observing that humans make predictions based on their objectives and observations, manifesting in various forms such as textual planning, visual imagination, or subconscious action-level planning.  The section then introduces the concept of *Predictive Models*, which exhibit predictive capabilities enabling them to complete embodied tasks through human-like predictions.  Examples of these models are given, showcasing their applications across domains such as high-level planning, image-based guidance, and future video prediction.  The authors point out that the diversity and broad applications of predictive models currently lack a standardized categorization system, hindering progress.  They further note that existing evaluation benchmarks are inadequate for highly embodied predictive models, specifically lacking the capacity to assess them from an embodied perspective, which considers elements like perspective consistency and object fragility. This inadequacy is highlighted by the fact that existing benchmarks mostly concentrate on task planning capabilities via text outputs or aesthetic evaluations of visual outputs, ignoring the importance of physical properties and action-level performance. The introduction culminates by posing two core questions: can we develop a hierarchical system for categorizing predictive models based on their degree of embodiment, and can we develop a more detailed evaluation method for highly embodied predictive models from an embodied perspective?", "first_cons": "The introduction does not offer concrete examples of the limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating highly embodied predictive models.

The authors highlight the limitations of existing benchmarks in evaluating highly embodied models and emphasize the need for a more nuanced approach.  They classify predictive models into four stages (S0-S3) based on their output modality and level of embodiment.  S0 models generate text predictions, S1 models produce image predictions, S2 models generate videos, and S3 models generate actionable videos, aligning with the concept of World Simulators.

WorldSimBench employs a dual evaluation strategy:\n\n**1. Explicit Perceptual Evaluation:** This approach uses human feedback to evaluate the visual quality, consistency, and embodiment aspects of the generated videos.  A new dataset, HF-Embodied Dataset (containing 35,701 tuples with multi-dimensional scores and fine-grained human feedback), is introduced for this purpose, and a Human Preference Evaluator is trained on this data to provide consistent and accurate assessments.  This evaluation is structured around three hierarchical dimensions: Visual Quality (Aesthetics, Background/Foreground Consistency), Condition Consistency (Instruction/Scenario Alignment), and Embodiment (specific metrics varying across the three scenarios).  \n\n**2. Implicit Manipulative Evaluation:** This part assesses the video-action consistency of the World Simulators.  It evaluates whether the generated videos, which should be situationally aware, can be accurately translated into control signals within three different embodied scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environments (using MineRL), Autonomous Driving (using CARLA), and Robot Manipulation (using CALVIN).   This evaluation assesses the performance of the World Simulators using task completion rates.  \n\nThe overall evaluation is performed across three representative embodied scenarios: Open-Ended Embodied Environment, Autonomous Driving, and Robot Manipulation.
