[{"heading_title": "InfiR: Edge Reasoning", "details": {"summary": "**InfiR: Edge Reasoning** suggests a focus on enabling AI reasoning capabilities directly on edge devices. This implies **optimizing small language models (SLMs)** for efficient computation and deployment in resource-constrained environments. Key challenges include **balancing model size and reasoning performance**, addressing **privacy concerns** by processing data locally, and developing **specialized training pipelines** and architectures tailored for edge deployment. The research likely explores techniques for model compression, knowledge distillation, and efficient inference to achieve state-of-the-art reasoning on edge devices while minimizing latency and power consumption. Furthermore, it may consider incorporating multimodal inputs to enhance the reasoning process in real-world applications."}}, {"heading_title": "SLM Training Pipeline", "details": {"summary": "I don't see an explicit \"SLM Training Pipeline\" section. However, inferring from the content, a hypothetical SLM training pipeline would likely involve several key stages. **Pre-training** focuses on imbuing the model with broad knowledge using a large corpus of text and code, with a heavy emphasis on high-quality data and aggressive noise filtering via heuristic and model-based methods. The architecture is based on Llama-3.2 1B with a focus on 900 billion tokens. Data annealing refines the model, emphasizing reasoning capabilities with a smaller, carefully curated dataset. Subsequently, **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** would further hone the model\u2019s instruction-following and reasoning abilities via datasets involving instruction, reasoning and code relation. A diverse, high-quality SFT dataset ensures robustness. A visual projector helps align visual features. **Rejection sampling** is also used to improve the quality of responses. The aim is to allow smaller models to perform tasks efficiently."}}, {"heading_title": "Data Annealing", "details": {"summary": "Data annealing, as I envision it, is a clever method for **refining a pre-trained model**. It involves further training with a dataset emphasizing high-quality reasoning and data that bridges the gap between pre-training and the later fine-tuning stages. It's about **improving reasoning abilities**. Annealing dataset construction requires careful selection of examples, **blending original data with open source and synthetic datasets**. This focuses on keeping source code while dropping the web data. Proper setting on **data ratios is very important**."}}, {"heading_title": "MultiModal Finetuning", "details": {"summary": "Multimodal fine-tuning is a critical stage for adapting pre-trained models to specific downstream tasks, particularly when dealing with data from diverse sources. This process involves adjusting the model's parameters to effectively integrate and process information from various modalities such as images, text, and audio. **Effective strategies typically involve carefully curated datasets**, tailored loss functions, and specialized architectures designed to handle the complexities of cross-modal interactions. **Transfer learning techniques are often employed**, leveraging knowledge gained from large-scale pre-training to accelerate convergence and improve generalization on target tasks. **Data augmentation and regularization methods play a vital role** in preventing overfitting and ensuring robust performance across different scenarios."}}, {"heading_title": "Long CoT Impact", "details": {"summary": "The impact of long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data on small language models is a fascinating area. Extending the CoT during training may significantly improve complex reasoning, but it has drawbacks. **Longer CoTs demand increased computational resources** during both training and inference. Small models may struggle to effectively learn from extremely long CoTs due to limited capacity, potentially leading to overfitting. The quality of long CoT data is paramount; noisy or irrelevant steps can hinder learning. Careful data curation and filtering are essential. The optimal CoT length may vary depending on the task and model size. **There's a need for adaptive techniques** that dynamically adjust CoT length during inference to balance accuracy and efficiency."}}]
