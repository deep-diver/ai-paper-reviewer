Small Language Models (SLMs) offer a solution, balancing performance and efficiency with lower costs. A key challenge is enhancing SLM reasoning while keeping them small, crucial for accessibility and privacy. Existing models often require cloud deployment raising privacy concerns. Thus, there is a need for practical AI systems capable of performing reasoning tasks, while reducing barriers to AI system adoption and addressing user privacy requirements through model size reduction.\n\nThis paper introduces **InfiR**, a novel training pipeline enhancing reasoning in small models for edge deployment. InfiR includes a pre- and post-training pipeline, achieving state-of-the-art results at the 1B parameter scale. The InfiR-VL-1.6B model excels in Android scenarios, improving accuracy. **The project aims to advance AI systems by improving reasoning, reducing adoption barriers, and addressing privacy concerns through smaller model sizes.** Resources are available at https://github.com/Reallm-Labs/InfiR.", "affiliation": "Reallm Labs", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.11573/podcast.wav"}
