Existing search-based methods often struggle with excessive exploration, while auto-regressive generation lacks global awareness. This results in either inefficient computation or suboptimal performance. There is also room for better resource management so that more computation can be allocated to where it matters most. \n\nThis paper addresses these issues by framing the decoding strategy as **foresight sampling** and introducing **\u03a6-Decoding**. This novel approach leverages simulated future steps to estimate step value and adaptively balances exploration and exploitation. This method is shown to outperform existing approaches in both performance and efficiency across multiple benchmarks, offering superior generalization and scalability.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.13288/podcast.wav"}
