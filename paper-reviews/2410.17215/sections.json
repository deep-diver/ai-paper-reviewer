It addresses the inefficiencies and limitations of existing KD methods by refining the training data distribution offline, rather than during the training process. This is achieved through *Difference Sampling*, which leverages the discrepancies in probability distributions between a large teacher LM and a smaller reference LM.  Difference Sampling identifies and prioritizes training instances that the teacher LM finds valuable but the smaller model struggles with, effectively increasing the difficulty and diversity of the training data. This process is highly efficient because it avoids online teacher LM inference, and is also flexible, supporting KD across different model families. The student LMs are subsequently pre-trained from scratch on this refined data distribution, resulting in improved performance on downstream tasks and enhanced language modeling capabilities. The effectiveness is demonstrated through improved zero-shot accuracy across nine downstream NLP tasks and reduced pre-training computation (e.g., a 2.2x reduction in computation for 500M student LMs while maintaining performance comparable to Vanilla KD).  The approach is also shown to be beneficial for larger pre-training scales, supporting KD across model families, and enhancing data utilization (reducing data demand by 2.4 times).", "first_cons": "The method relies on the availability of probabilities from both the teacher and reference LMs, which might limit its application to closed-source models or those lacking convenient APIs for probability access.", "first_pros": "MINIPLM offers significant computational efficiency improvements by performing offline teacher LM inference, enabling KD for multiple student LMs without increasing training time costs.
