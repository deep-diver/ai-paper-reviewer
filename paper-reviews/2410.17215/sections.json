While scaling up model size improves performance, it increases inference costs. Training smaller, more deployment-friendly LMs is challenging due to suboptimal compute configurations. Knowledge distillation (KD), where a small student model learns from a large teacher model, is a promising approach, but applying KD during pre-training presents unique challenges. Online KD methods, which perform online teacher LM inference, incur high computational costs and limit flexibility across model families, diminishing the benefits if that computation was instead used to extend pre-training. Offline KD avoids this extra training time cost but struggles to maintain the difficulty and diversity of the teacher-generated data, leading to overfitting.  These limitations motivate the need for a more efficient, flexible, and effective KD framework for pre-training.", "first_cons": "Online KD methods are computationally expensive due to online teacher LM inference, limiting flexibility and diminishing benefits compared to simply extending pre-training without KD.", "first_pros": "Knowledge distillation is a promising approach for training high-performing small language models.", "keypoints": ["Scaling up language model size improves performance but leads to high inference costs.", "Training smaller LMs is challenging due to suboptimal compute configurations.", "Online KD is computationally expensive, while offline KD struggles to maintain data difficulty and diversity.", "The introduction highlights the need for a more efficient and effective knowledge distillation (KD) framework for pre-training."], "second_cons": "Offline KD methods, while efficient, risk losing the difficulty and diversity of teacher-generated training data, leading to overfitting and hindering generalization.", "second_pros": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) is a promising approach for creating high-performing small Language Models (LMs).", "summary": "Training efficient, deployment-ready small language models (LMs) is difficult because scaling up model size increases inference costs, and current knowledge distillation (KD) methods for pre-training, whether online or offline, have significant drawbacks.

Instead of directly supervising the student LM's output like traditional online KD methods, MINIPLM refines the pre-training data distribution itself. It leverages a small reference LM alongside a large teacher LM to identify instances where the teacher assigns high probability but the smaller model does not. These \"hard\" and \"diverse\" instances, which are under-represented in the student LM's training distribution, are up-sampled to enhance the training data's quality.  Conversely, easy and common patterns that both models easily predict are down-sampled, thereby improving the student LM's learning efficiency and generalization ability. This approach is entirely offline, eliminating the computational cost of online teacher inference and allowing for flexibility in using different student LM architectures and tokenizers.  The process of refining the pre-training data is described as 'Difference Sampling',  which is theoretically proven to achieve high overlap with direct sampling from a student LM's generated output, even without online teacher inference. Finally, the student LM is trained from scratch on this enhanced data distribution. The process is illustrated as 'Difference Sampling', which promotes data difficulty and diversity by downsampling easy and common patterns, upsampling hard and diverse instances and filtering noisy or harmful instances.", "first_cons": "The method requires pre-training a small reference LM, adding some computational overhead, although it is significantly less than online KD methods.

It begins by detailing the experimental setup, which includes using the Qwen-1.5 1.8B model as the teacher LM and training student LMs with varying sizes (200M, 500M, and 1.2B parameters). The pre-training data consists of a maximum of 50B tokens from the Pile dataset.  Four baseline methods are compared: Pre-Train w/o KD (no knowledge distillation), Vanilla KD (online token-level KD), SeqKD (offline sequence-level KD), and MiniLLM (online KD with PPO).
