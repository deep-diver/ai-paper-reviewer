The reasoning processes are generated progressively through a reasoning generator, and then fed into a multi-granularity assessment system to ensure high-quality reasoning.", "description": "Insight-V's data generation pipeline is a two-step process. First, a reasoning generator creates structured reasoning paths progressively, adding steps until a summary is needed.  The generator produces diverse reasoning paths for a given question and image. Second, a multi-granularity assessment system evaluates the reasoning paths.  This system uses a strong LLM for initial filtering based on the final answer, then uses a separate agent to score paths based on details and accuracy.  This automated approach avoids manual labor, allowing scalable creation of high-quality reasoning data.", "section": "3.2.

The system is divided into two agents: a reasoning agent and a summary agent.  The reasoning agent generates a step-by-step chain of thought to solve a visual reasoning problem, while the summary agent evaluates this chain of thought and provides a concise, accurate answer.

The x-axis represents the amount of training data (in thousands), and the y-axis represents the relative performance of the agent across several benchmarks (MMMU, MMMU-Pro, MathVista, MMStar, ChartQA, and MME). The graph demonstrates a clear upward trend, indicating that as the size of the training dataset increases, so does the agent's performance on these benchmarks. This is because more data provides the reasoning agent with more comprehensive and diverse examples, improving its ability to generate effective reasoning processes, leading to better quality insights for the summary agent.", "section": "3.4.

It shows confusion matrices illustrating the accuracy of reasoning paths and final answers generated by both methods.  The matrices highlight Insight-V's superior ability to produce accurate reasoning paths even when the initial reasoning path is incorrect.  Importantly, it demonstrates Insight-V's capacity to leverage partially correct or incomplete reasoning to arrive at the correct final answer, a feat not consistently achieved by the direct Chain-of-Thought approach.
