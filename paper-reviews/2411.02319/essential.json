It addresses the scarcity of large-scale 4D datasets by introducing **CamVid-30K**, which enables significant advancements in dynamic scene generation.  The innovative multiview-temporal modules and masked latent conditions allow for **flexible and high-quality content generation** from varied input views.  This opens promising new directions for research on 3D and 4D generative models and their applications in virtual reality, video games, and other domains.", "summary": "GenXD: A unified model generating high-quality 3D & 4D scenes from any number of images, advancing the field of dynamic scene generation.", "takeaways": ["GenXD is a unified model capable of generating high-quality 3D and 4D scenes from any number of input images.", "The introduction of CamVid-30K, a large-scale 4D dataset, significantly advances research in dynamic 3D scene generation.", "GenXD's novel multiview-temporal modules and masked latent conditions offer flexible and high-quality content generation from varied input views."], "tldr": "Generating realistic 3D and 4D scenes from images is challenging due to the lack of large-scale datasets and effective model designs. Current methods struggle with dynamic content creation and handling varying numbers of input images. This paper tackles these issues by proposing GenXD, a unified model for high-quality 3D and 4D scene generation.  It also introduces a new large-scale dataset, CamVid-30K, specifically designed to improve the training and evaluation of 4D generation models.\nGenXD employs innovative multiview-temporal modules to efficiently disentangle camera and object movements, enabling seamless learning from both 3D and 4D data.  Masked latent conditions provide flexibility, allowing for the use of any number of conditioning views without modifying the model. Extensive evaluations demonstrate GenXD's effectiveness in generating realistic videos and 3D-consistent views, showcasing its superiority over existing methods in both single and multi-view scenarios.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}}
