Current video benchmarks often involve subjective reasoning, lack definitive answers, or don't require external knowledge. This makes it hard to evaluate if these models truly grasp real-world facts when processing videos.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces **Video SimpleQA**, a new benchmark designed to test the factuality of LVLMs. It requires models to integrate external knowledge, answer fact-seeking questions with definitive, short answers, and provide external verification sources. The benchmark reveals that current LVLMs struggle with factuality, even with test-time compute or RAG. **Video SimpleQA** serves as a critical tool for directing LVLM development toward verifiable real-world understanding.", "affiliation": "MBZUAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18923/podcast.wav"}
