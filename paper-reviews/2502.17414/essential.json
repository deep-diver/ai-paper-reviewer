Existing methods often rely on 3D human pose estimation, which can be inaccurate and limit the diversity of generated motions, particularly lacking head and hand details. Moreover, creating high-fidelity video outputs that maintain visual consistency with the original image and ensure temporal smoothness remains difficult. \n\nThe paper introduces a novel approach that creates diverse and lifelike dance videos from a single static image using music as the sole driver. This is achieved through a unified transformer-diffusion framework that generates extended, music-synchronized sequences of 2D body poses, which then guide a diffusion model to produce coherent and realistic dance video frames. The framework features an autoregressive transformer model for synthesizing 2D poses, capturing both large body movements and fine-grained motions. **This approach addresses data limitations and enhances scalability by modeling a wide spectrum of 2D dance motions, resulting in high-quality, expressive dance videos.**", "affiliation": "UC San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.17414/podcast.wav"}
