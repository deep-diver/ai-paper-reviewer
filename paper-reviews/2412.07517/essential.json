ReFlows, an alternative to popular diffusion models, offer faster image generation by using simpler mathematical equations. However, precisely inverting and editing images with ReFlows was slow, hindering their wider use. **This problem limits real-time high-fidelity applications like image editing and latent space manipulation**. Existing methods either sacrificed accuracy or computational resources.\n\nFireFlow tackles this issue by introducing a novel numerical solver for ReFlows. **This innovative solver dramatically speeds up image inversion while improving accuracy**.  It reuses previously calculated data, avoiding redundant calculations. **This allows ReFlow models to invert and edit images in only 8 steps**, achieving a 3x speedup compared to state-of-the-art methods, all without additional training. This breakthrough opens up exciting possibilities for real-time, high-fidelity image editing applications.", "affiliation": "Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.07517/podcast.wav"}
