Traditional methods fall short in adequately capturing these dimensions. To address this, the paper introduces a comprehensive framework for evaluating AI-generated image quality that is multimodal, multi-round, and multi-aspect. This approach ensures a more thorough and human-aligned assessment. \n\nThe paper proposes **M3-AGIQA, which distills image captioning capabilities from online MLLMs into a local model via LoRA fine-tuning**. It uses a structured multi-round evaluation mechanism, generating intermediate image descriptions for deeper insights. An xLSTM-based predictor aligns predictions with human judgments. Experiments show state-of-the-art performance and strong generalizability, **setting a new benchmark in AGI quality assessment**.", "affiliation": "Heifei University of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.15167/podcast.wav"}
