Two main approaches exist: sequential scaling (extending reasoning chain length) and parallel scaling (sampling multiple solutions).  Prior studies suggest that longer reasoning chains lead to better performance. However, this paper challenges this assumption.\nThis paper investigates three state-of-the-art LLMs and discovers that longer reasoning chains do not consistently improve accuracy; in fact, correct solutions tend to be shorter than incorrect ones.  The researchers attribute this to the models' self-revision capabilities, where longer chains contain more self-corrections that often degrade performance.  To address this, they propose a novel test-time scaling method called \"Shortest Majority Vote\" that combines parallel scaling with a focus on shorter solutions, leading to significantly improved scalability.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science, Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.12215/podcast.wav"}
