Existing methods struggle with the computational overhead of large vocabulary sizes, particularly in the Language Modeling (LM) Head, which becomes a bottleneck. Current solutions are also hindered by suboptimal implementation frameworks, obscuring the true impact of vocabulary size on performance.\n\nTo tackle these challenges, this paper introduces a novel approach called FR-Spec. FR-Spec optimizes the selection of draft candidates by compressing the vocabulary space, focusing on high-frequency tokens. This reduces the computational burden on the LM Head while ensuring the final output distribution remains consistent. The method involves detailed profiling to identify bottlenecks and an optimized implementation framework to ensure accurate evaluation. The results demonstrate that FR-Spec achieves significant speedups over existing methods.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14856/podcast.wav"}
