To fix this, generative models use CLIP's visual features for reconstruction. However, the underlying principle remains underexplored. The authors found that visually perfect generations aren't always optimal for enhancement. Effective extraction of fine-grained knowledge while reducing irrelevant info is key. They found that even small local tokens can cause training collapse, leading to the conclusion that only global visual tokens are most effective. \n\nTo address this, the authors introduce **GenHancer**, a two-stage training strategy prioritizing useful visual knowledge, using lightweight denoisers, showing that end-to-end training introduces extraneous information. They validate their method using both continuous and discrete denoisers and present an effective method (GenHancer) that consistently outperforms prior methods on the MMVP-VLM benchmark. Enhanced CLIP leads to vision-centric performance.", "affiliation": "ARC Lab, Tencent PCG", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.19480/podcast.wav"}
