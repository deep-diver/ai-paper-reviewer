Unlike LoRA which uses random initialization for low-rank matrices, LoLDU utilizes LDU decomposition to initialize low-rank matrices, aiming for faster convergence and orthogonality.  The core idea is to decompose the weight matrix into orthogonal lower and upper triangular matrices and a diagonal matrix. The method focuses on optimizing only the diagonal matrix (diag(z)) and a scaling factor (\u03c3) for scale transformations. The weight update is expressed as AW = \u03c3\u22c5P\u22c5(Lr, diag(zr), Ur), where P is a permutation matrix, Lr, diag(zr), and Ur represent the top-r components of the LDU decomposition of the original weight matrix.  The algorithm incorporates a heuristic initialization for diag(zr) using methods such as Constant, Uniform, Normal, or Regular LDU, to enhance training stability. The optimization process uses projected gradient descent to fine-tune the diagonal matrix and scaling factor while maintaining orthogonality.  The overall complexity is O(n) for low-rank updates, significantly reducing the computational cost compared to LoRA's O(n^2).", "first_cons": "The reliance on LDU decomposition might limit its applicability to certain types of weight matrices or network architectures where such decomposition isn't easily achievable or efficient.", "first_pros": "LoLDU significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially by 2600 times compared to regular PEFT methods, while maintaining comparable performance.
