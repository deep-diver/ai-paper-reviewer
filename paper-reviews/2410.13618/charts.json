Our LoLDU methods with r = {1, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512,768} exhibit superior parameter efficiency and performance when contrasted with Linear Probing [13] (LP, fine tuning the classifier head only\u00b9), FourierFT [14] (n = {3000, 10000}), LoRA [9] (r = 16), and Full Fine-Tuning. LoLDU r=768 outperforms LoRAr=16 with 96.837% fewer trainable parameters. Particularly noteworthy is that LoLDU with r 1 achieves competitive scores with just 24 trainable parameters, while LoLDU with r = 768 attains the highest accuracy: 42.15% for FGVC and 66.66% for StanfordCars, showcasing the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. Full Fine-Tuning (85.8M parameters) and Linear Probing represent the upper and lower performance bounds, respectively.", "description": "The chart compares the performance (accuracy) of different parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods against the number of trainable parameters on FGVC and StanfordCars datasets using ViT Base.", "section": "IV.
