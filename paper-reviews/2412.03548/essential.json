Fine-tuning these models on relevant data doesn't generalize well, and using specialized vision tools is computationally expensive. This paper addresses these issues. \nThe researchers introduce AURORA, a training method that enhances multimodal language models by incorporating \"Perception Tokens.\" These tokens act as intermediate reasoning steps, similar to chain-of-thought prompts, allowing the models to reason over intermediate representations like depth maps and bounding boxes.  **AURORA significantly improves the models' performance on various visual reasoning benchmarks, surpassing existing approaches.**", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.03548/podcast.wav"}
