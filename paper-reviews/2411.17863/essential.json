{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in natural language processing and information retrieval. **It directly addresses the limitations of existing keyphrase extraction methods in handling long documents**, a significant challenge in the field. The proposed framework, LongKey, opens new avenues for improving information access and management in various domains, impacting the efficiency of research workflows and potentially leading to better information systems.", "summary": "LongKey: A novel framework excels at extracting keyphrases from lengthy documents using an encoder-based language model and max-pooling, outperforming existing methods across diverse datasets.", "takeaways": ["LongKey, a new framework for keyphrase extraction, effectively handles long documents.", "LongKey outperforms existing methods on various datasets, demonstrating its superior performance.", "The max-pooling embedder in LongKey enhances keyphrase representation and accuracy."], "tldr": "Current keyphrase extraction techniques struggle with long documents due to the limitations of existing language models and the difficulty of capturing extended text context.  This leads to inaccurate and incomplete extraction of vital information from lengthy documents, hindering effective information retrieval and management. \nLongKey tackles this problem by employing a Longformer-based encoder model capable of processing documents with up to 96K tokens.  It also incorporates a novel max-pooling embedding strategy to improve keyphrase representation.  **Evaluated against existing methods on various datasets, LongKey demonstrates superior performance**, showcasing its ability to reliably and accurately extract keyphrases from long documents, significantly advancing the state-of-the-art in long-document keyphrase extraction.", "affiliation": "University of Luxembourg", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Information Extraction"}, "podcast_path": "2411.17863/podcast.wav"}
