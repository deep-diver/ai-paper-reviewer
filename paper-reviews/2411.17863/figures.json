[{"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2411.17863/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 1: Overall workflow of the LongKey approach.", "description": "The figure illustrates the three main stages of the LongKey keyphrase extraction framework: 1) Word embedding uses the Longformer model to generate embeddings for each word in the input document.  For documents longer than 8K tokens, the document is chunked into smaller parts before processing, and the resulting embeddings are concatenated. 2) Keyphrase embedding utilizes a convolutional neural network to generate embeddings for each keyphrase candidate (n-grams up to length n = 5), and max pooling combines the embeddings of all occurrences of a candidate into a single representation. 3) Candidate scoring assigns a ranking score to each candidate using linear layers and a margin ranking loss.  The scores are then used to rank and select the most relevant keyphrases. ", "section": "II.

The x-axis represents document length categorized into six bins (less than 512 words, 512-1024, 1024-2048, 2048-4096, 4096-8192, and more than 8192 words). The y-axis displays the F1@K score (harmonic mean of precision and recall, where K represents the top K extracted keyphrases, varying from 1 to 10).  Different colored lines represent the results for each method using either a Longformer or BERT encoder.  The dashed lines show the F1@O score (where O is the optimal number of keyphrases based on the ground truth). The graph visualizes how the performance of these methods changes with document length and which encoder performs better in each document length range.", "section": "IV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}]
