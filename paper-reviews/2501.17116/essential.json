Quantized training, using lower-precision numbers, is a promising approach, but achieving good accuracy with very low-precision (like 4-bit floating point, or FP4) has been challenging due to significant errors introduced by the quantization process.  Prior work successfully demonstrated FP8 (8-bit) quantization, but extending this to FP4 has remained elusive. \nThis work introduces the first-ever training framework for LLMs using FP4.  The key innovation lies in two areas: a new differentiable quantization estimator that more accurately estimates weight updates during training, and a strategy to handle the problem of outlier values in activations (the outputs of neurons), preventing large errors.  Experiments demonstrate that their approach achieves accuracy similar to BF16 and FP8, while scaling effectively to large models (13 billion parameters).  The results suggest that FP4 may become a practical approach for efficient LLM training, especially with upcoming hardware supporting the format.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.17116/podcast.wav"}
