The comparison is based on multiple metrics, including CLIP score (measuring alignment between generated images and text prompts), FID (Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance, evaluating image quality and diversity), Aesthetic Score (based on user preferences), and ImageReward (also reflecting user preferences). Results are shown for both one-step and multi-step (2 and 4 steps) generation to illustrate the model's performance at various speed-quality tradeoffs.  The table allows for a direct assessment of NitroFusion's relative strengths and weaknesses compared to competing approaches.", "section": "4.3.
