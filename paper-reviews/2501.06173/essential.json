They often produce short clips lacking clear storytelling.  This limits their application in areas requiring comprehensive visual narratives, such as movie production or interactive storytelling.  The lack of suitable datasets further hinders progress in this field.\nThis paper tackles these challenges by introducing CookGen, a large-scale cooking video dataset with detailed annotations.  Using this dataset, the authors develop VideoAuteur, a new model for long narrative video generation.  **VideoAuteur uses an interleaved auto-regressive approach**, generating actions, captions, and keyframes sequentially, improving both visual and semantic coherence.  The results demonstrate significant improvements in generating high-quality narrative videos, showcasing the effectiveness of their method.", "affiliation": "Johns Hopkins University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2501.06173/podcast.wav"}
