Existing methods often use either acoustic tokens from audio codecs or semantic tokens from self-supervised learning models, but lack contextual information which is crucial for comprehension. DM-Codec overcomes this by employing two novel distillation techniques: a language model (LM)-guided approach and a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided approach. These methods effectively integrate acoustic, semantic, and contextual features into a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a residual vector quantizer.  Experiments on the LibriSpeech benchmark demonstrate DM-Codec's superiority over state-of-the-art models, significantly reducing Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) while improving speech quality and intelligibility. The approach is innovative because it efficiently combines multiple data modalities to provide a comprehensive speech representation."}
