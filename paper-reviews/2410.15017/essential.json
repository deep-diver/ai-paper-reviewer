Current methods rely on either acoustic information from audio compression techniques or semantic information from AI models trained on vast amounts of speech data. DM-Codec cleverly combines both, adding a third key ingredient: contextual information from language models. These language models help understand the meaning of words within a sentence, which is crucial for accurate speech-to-text.  Experiments show DM-Codec significantly reduces errors in speech-to-text tasks and improves the quality and clarity of reconstructed speech. The authors propose two innovative techniques, or distillation methods, to combine the different types of information smoothly into DM-Codec.  One is guided by a language model, the other by both a language model and a speech model.  The results strongly suggest that including contextual information is vital for high-quality speech processing."}
