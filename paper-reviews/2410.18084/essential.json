DynamicCity tackles this limitation by introducing a new 4D LiDAR generation framework capable of creating large-scale, high-quality scenes that capture the temporal evolution of dynamic environments.  It achieves this through two key models: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a compact 4D representation called HexPlane, and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) that generates HexPlanes. The VAE employs a novel Projection Module to efficiently compress 4D LiDAR features and an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D features, improving both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy.  The DiT uses a Padded Rollout Operation to effectively handle HexPlane generation. DynamicCity supports various conditional generation applications, such as trajectory and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation.  Extensive experiments show DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of multiple evaluation metrics, including generation quality, speed, and memory usage."}
