Existing methods struggle to produce large-scale, dynamic scenes. DynamicCity overcomes this by using a two-stage process. First, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns a compact 4D representation called HexPlane. This representation is then used by a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to generate the actual LiDAR data. The VAE employs a novel projection module to effectively compress the data into six 2D feature maps, making it efficient for DiT processing.  The DiT is further enhanced by a Padded Rollout Operation that arranges the HexPlane feature maps into a squared format. This improves the model's efficiency and accuracy.  DynamicCity is evaluated on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods across several metrics, and demonstrating its versatility through various application scenarios. The research is significant because it offers a step change in generating more detailed and comprehensive 4D LiDAR data that is much closer to real-world situations. This capability could substantially improve the development and training of autonomous systems."}
