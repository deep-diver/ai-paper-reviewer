Existing methods often struggle with generating large-scale, dynamic scenes, focusing on static or single-frame outputs. DynamicCity overcomes this limitation by using a two-stage process.  First, it employs a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn a compact 4D representation called HexPlane.  The VAE uses a novel 'Projection Module' to compress the high-dimensional LiDAR data efficiently and an 'Expansion & Squeeze Strategy' to improve reconstruction quality and speed. Second, it uses a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to generate the HexPlane, making it possible to incorporate diverse conditions such as trajectories or commands to control the scene generation.  The model is trained on large-scale datasets like CarlaSC and Occ3D-Waymo.  Experimental results demonstrate DynamicCity outperforms state-of-the-art methods, significantly improving generation quality, speed, and memory efficiency.  The researchers also showcase the versatility of DynamicCity through various downstream applications, like inpainting damaged scenes or generating scenes based on user-defined layouts."}
