Existing methods often involve complex model modifications or extensive retraining, limiting their flexibility and applicability.  The challenge lies in aligning visual content with temporal information accurately, hindering precise event timing identification. \nThis paper introduces Number-Prompt (NumPro), a simple yet highly effective method that significantly improves VTG. NumPro addresses the issue by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame, making temporal grounding as intuitive as 'flipping through manga.'  This allows Vid-LLMs to easily link visual content with corresponding temporal information. The effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on multiple datasets and models, showcasing substantial performance improvements both in training-free scenarios and with fine-tuning (NumPro-FT).", "affiliation": "Southeast University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2411.10332/podcast.wav"}
