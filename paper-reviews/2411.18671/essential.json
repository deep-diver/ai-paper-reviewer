Existing methods either require computationally expensive cost-volume processing or struggle to maintain tracking accuracy in the presence of significant changes or scene cuts.   \n\nTAPTRv3 tackles these issues by incorporating a novel Context-aware Cross-Attention mechanism that leverages contextual information for improved spatial feature representation and a Visibility-aware Long-Temporal Attention mechanism that handles occlusions and temporal drift effectively.  These improvements, combined with a global matching module for scene cut handling, enable TAPTRv3 to robustly and accurately track any point across long videos, achieving state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2411.18671/podcast.wav"}
