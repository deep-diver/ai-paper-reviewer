This is problematic in regulated fields like bio-manufacturing where any deviation can violate data integrity. Existing methods such as fine-tuning and prompt engineering have limitations in cost, transparency, and consistency.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces ThinkJSON, a reinforcement learning framework for training LLMs to generate schema-adherent outputs. **The framework combines synthetic data generation, a distilled reasoning model, and custom reward functions to guide the LLM's learning process.** The results show that ThinkJSON achieves higher schema adherence and lower noise compared to other models. This is a **resource-efficient and compliance-aware approach** to structured text generation.", "affiliation": "MasterControl AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14905/podcast.wav"}
