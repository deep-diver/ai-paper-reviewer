It begins by describing the common experience of capturing moments through photos, which lack the immersive quality of a video, particularly the sense of scale and dynamic movement.  This leads to the introduction of panoramic images, effective for static scenes, but deficient for moving objects.  The core problem is then presented: how to create a panoramic video from a casually-captured panning video, which implies a wide field of view but limited capturing capability. This is framed as a space-time outpainting problem which requires a robust, realistic prior over video content and motion, typically achieved using generative video models. However, these models possess inherent context limitations, and therefore, the task is far from trivial.  The authors emphasize the novelty of their approach in handling multi-pan scenarios and a wide range of real-world scenarios with moving objects, leading to the main contribution: creating video panoramas from general, panning input videos containing dynamic elements.", "first_cons": "The introduction focuses heavily on the problem statement without explicitly mentioning the proposed solution's core methodology, leaving the reader in suspense.", "first_pros": "The introduction effectively highlights the limitations of existing methods for capturing and representing dynamic scenes, creating a strong motivation for the research.", "keypoints": ["Limitations of photos in capturing the immersive quality of dynamic scenes.", "Inability of traditional panoramic image stitching to handle moving objects.", "Framing the problem as space-time outpainting.", "Need for a robust prior over video content and motion (generative video models).", "Challenges of generative video models' limited context windows.", "Novelty of handling multi-pan scenarios and diverse real-world scenes with dynamic elements."], "second_cons": "The introduction lacks specific details on the dataset used for evaluating the proposed approach, although the creation of such a dataset is mentioned as a contribution.", "second_pros": "The introduction clearly defines the problem and its significance, effectively conveying the value and novelty of the proposed research.", "summary": "The paper introduces the challenge of generating panoramic videos from casually captured panning videos, highlighting the limitations of existing methods in handling dynamic scenes and the need for a robust, yet context-limited, generative video model.

The Video Panoramas subsection explores techniques to generate panoramic videos, focusing on methods that handle some motion but often struggle with complex movements or transient objects. Finally, Video Completion covers techniques for filling in missing parts of videos, noting their limitations when dealing with sparsely observed or highly incomplete video data.

It begins by projecting the input video onto a panoramic canvas, creating a mask of known pixels.  The core process involves temporally downsampling the video to fit within the context window of a generative video model (either a diffusion-based model like Lumiere or a token-based model like Phenaki). A base panoramic video is then completed at this coarsest temporal resolution using spatial outpainting with mask-conditioned generation. This involves dividing the panoramic canvas into overlapping spatial windows, generating predictions within each window, and averaging the overlapping predictions to achieve a coherent result. This base video is then upsampled temporally, merged with the original input video, and further refined through additional resynthesis steps to progressively restore temporal details at higher resolutions. The process includes optional finetuning of the generative model at inference time to enhance fidelity. The entire pipeline leverages the strengths of generative models while mitigating limitations such as limited context windows through careful temporal and spatial processing. This approach makes it possible to handle a range of in-the-wild scenes including people, vehicles, and flowing water, as well as stationary background features.", "first_cons": "The method relies on generative models with limited context windows, requiring a coarse-to-fine approach that can be computationally expensive and may introduce artifacts.
