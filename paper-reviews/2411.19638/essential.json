{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in multilingual NLP and text classification.  It presents a novel teacher-student framework that efficiently addresses the scarcity of annotated data, a major hurdle in many languages. **The open-source release of the model and dataset greatly benefits the community**, enabling further research and application in diverse news-related tasks.", "summary": "Researchers developed a multilingual news topic classifier using a teacher-student framework and GPT-40 for automatic data annotation, achieving high performance without manual annotation.", "takeaways": ["A novel teacher-student framework efficiently trains multilingual news topic classifiers with minimal manual annotation.", "The resulting multilingual model shows strong zero-shot cross-lingual capabilities, performing comparably or even better on unseen languages.", "A high-performing, multilingual news topic classifier and a new dataset are made publicly available, fostering further research and applications."], "tldr": "The ever-growing volume of online news necessitates efficient topic classification across various languages.  However, creating robust multilingual classifiers is challenging due to the scarcity of manually-annotated training data, which is expensive and labor-intensive to produce. Existing datasets often suffer from inconsistencies or use outdated topic schemata. This paper tackles these issues by proposing a novel methodology.\nThis study introduces a teacher-student framework leveraging large language models (LLMs). A GPT model automatically annotates news articles in several languages, creating a substantial training dataset. Smaller, more computationally efficient BERT-like models are then fine-tuned on this data.  The research thoroughly evaluates the framework's performance, comparing the teacher LLM's annotation quality to human annotators and demonstrating high performance even with relatively small training datasets.  **The best-performing multilingual classifier is made publicly available**, along with the generated dataset, advancing the field significantly.", "affiliation": "Jo\u017eef Stefan Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2411.19638/podcast.wav"}
