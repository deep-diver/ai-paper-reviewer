The authors propose a novel approach using a synthetically generated preference dataset and a new optimization technique, RankDPO, to overcome these limitations.  Instead of relying on expensive human feedback, they generate images using multiple T2I models and rank them according to a pre-trained reward function.  This synthetic dataset is then used to train the models using RankDPO, which enhances DPO methods by incorporating richer information from the ranking feedback.  Experiments demonstrate that this approach improves both prompt-following and visual quality of the generated images, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly lower computational costs compared to existing methods.  This work offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for improving T2I model performance."}
