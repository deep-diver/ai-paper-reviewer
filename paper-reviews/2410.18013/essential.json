Current methods rely heavily on expensive, human-labeled datasets which quickly become outdated. This research proposes a novel scalable solution. Instead of relying on human annotations, they create a synthetic preference dataset ('Syn-Pic') by generating images from multiple T2I models and ranking them using pre-trained reward functions. This significantly reduces costs and time.  Furthermore, they introduce 'RankDPO', a new optimization technique that leverages this ranked data, enhancing the model's ability to follow prompts accurately and generate higher quality images. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that this approach outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results while using far fewer resources.  The synthetic data collection method is highly scalable, allowing for continuous improvements as new T2I models emerge."}
