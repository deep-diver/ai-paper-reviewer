Current methods for aligning T2I models with human feedback involve either collecting large-scale datasets of user preferences (which can be costly and quickly outdated) or fine-tuning the models with reward functions (which can be computationally expensive and prone to \u2018reward hacking\u2019).  The authors highlight the limitations of existing approaches:  challenges with compositional generation, limitations in rendering text and spatial understanding, and the high cost of data collection with human annotation (e.g., Pick-a-Picv2 costing nearly \\$50K for collecting 512x512px images while newer models generate 1024x1024px images). They introduce the concept of using synthetically labeled preferences as a cost-effective solution to overcome these challenges.  The authors propose two novel contributions: a synthetically labeled preference dataset (Syn-Pic) and a ranking-based preference optimization method (RankDPO).  Syn-Pic eliminates the need for human annotation by utilizing pre-trained reward models to label images generated from various models.  RankDPO is designed to leverage the richer signal from rankings as opposed to only pairwise preferences.", "first_cons": "The introduction heavily focuses on the limitations of existing methods without fully elaborating on the specifics of each limitation.

It begins by outlining diffusion models and their optimization using direct preference optimization (DPO).  A novel approach is presented to create a synthetically labeled preference dataset called Syn-Pic, which avoids expensive human annotation by leveraging pre-trained reward models.  The scores from multiple reward models are combined to create ranked preferences, not just pairwise preferences.  This ranked data is then used to train a new ranking-based preference optimization method called RankDPO. RankDPO uses a modified DPO objective that incorporates discounted cumulative gains (DCG) to leverage the richer information provided by ranked preferences.  The process uses the Bradley-Terry model for pairwise preference calculation, incorporating the reference model and the trainable model. The overall objective function is designed to improve scores for preferred images and worsen them for less preferred images within a ranked list for each prompt. Finally, the training process is described, involving randomly sampling a timestep and computing the denoising objective for preferred and less preferred images. The method is designed to be both scalable and cost-effective, generating much larger-scale datasets than previous approaches while also improving the quality of generated images.", "first_cons": "The reliance on pre-trained reward models introduces a potential bias or limitation based on their inherent capabilities and accuracy.
