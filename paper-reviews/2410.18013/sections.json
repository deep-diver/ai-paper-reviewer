It begins by outlining diffusion models and their application in direct preference optimization (DPO). The core contribution is a novel method for creating a large-scale, synthetically labeled preference dataset called Syn-Pic, bypassing the need for costly human annotation.  Instead, this is achieved by aggregating preferences from multiple pre-trained reward models to generate a ranking for images associated with each prompt. This ranked data is then used to train a new ranking-based preference optimization method, RankDPO, which adapts the DPO objective to utilize this ranked information. The method leverages the discounted cumulative gain (DCG) to weigh the preference loss, improving performance and robustness compared to using only pairwise comparisons. The section concludes with pseudocode illustrating the process of generating the synthetic dataset and training the RankDPO model, demonstrating its efficiency and scalability.", "first_cons": "The reliance on pre-trained reward models introduces a potential source of bias or inaccuracies, as the quality of the generated rankings directly depends on the accuracy of these models. The performance of the system might degrade if the reward models are not adequately trained or if they reflect biases present in their training data.", "first_pros": "The method significantly reduces the cost and time required for dataset creation, making it a scalable and efficient approach compared to methods that rely on human annotation. This scalability is highlighted by the cost comparison between traditional human-labeled datasets (e.g., Pick-a-Picv2, costing nearly \\$50k) and the proposed synthetic dataset (Syn-Pic, costing only \\$200).", "keypoints": ["Synthetic dataset creation (Syn-Pic) eliminates the need for human annotation, significantly reducing cost and time.
