The section then delves into the area of learning from human preferences, contrasting two main approaches: collecting large-scale datasets of user preferences and fine-tuning T2I models using reward functions.  The drawbacks of these approaches are highlighted:  the expensive and time-consuming nature of human annotation (e.g., Pick-a-Picv2 costing nearly \\$50K) and the computational cost of reward function-based methods, respectively.

It begins by outlining the process of creating a synthetic preference dataset (Syn-Pic) that avoids the cost and time constraints of human annotation.  This involves generating images from different T2I models using the same prompts and ranking these using multiple pre-trained reward models to capture human preferences without explicit annotation.  The core of the method is RankDPO, a novel ranking-based preference optimization technique.  Instead of the usual pairwise comparisons, RankDPO utilizes ranked preferences, using a discounted cumulative gain (DCG) weighting scheme within a modified direct preference optimization (DPO) loss function. This aims to enhance model training by learning from richer ranking signals rather than just pairwise preferences.  The algorithm's goal is to ensure that the denoising process enhances the quality of higher-ranked images while reducing the quality of lower-ranked images.  This section also includes the pseudocode for the data generation and training procedures within the appendix.", "first_cons": "The reliance on pre-trained reward models for generating preferences in Syn-Pic introduces a potential bias based on the limitations and idiosyncrasies of those models.
