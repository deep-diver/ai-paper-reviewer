These tasks in AI for Science have largely evolved independently. To address this gap, this paper introduces **Uni-3DAR, a unified framework** integrating 3D generation/understanding tasks via autoregressive prediction. Uni-3DAR employs hierarchical tokenization, compressing 3D space using an octree. It tokenizes fine-grained structure, capturing atom types/coordinates. Two optimizations are introduced for efficiency: a two-level subtree compression, which reduces the octree token sequence, and a masked next-token prediction tailored for varying token positions.\n\nUni-3DAR unifies diverse 3D generation/understanding tasks. Extensive experiments on microscopic 3D tasks (molecules, proteins, polymers, crystals) validate its effectiveness/versatility. Uni-3DAR surpasses diffusion models, achieving significant relative improvement. The method also delivers inference speeds much faster than previous methods. **The code is publicly available**, inviting further research and development in this area. The model achieves gains in efficiency while also setting a new state of the art in performance.", "affiliation": "DP Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16278/podcast.wav"}
