During image generation, a secret salt and a randomly selected index (i*) are used to securely generate an initial noise vector (zi*).  A group index (g*) is calculated (g* = i* % M), embedded into the noise using a Fourier pattern, and then the diffusion process generates the watermarked image.  Watermark detection involves inverse diffusion to reconstruct the initial noise (z~). The algorithm then searches for the closest group index (g~) based on the Fourier pattern in z~, and finally compares the noise indices within that group (g~) to find a match with the original noise vector.  This two-stage approach improves efficiency and robustness.", "section": "Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.04653/extracted/6049144/images/cosine_similarity_distribution.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Cosine similarity distribution between initial noise, and: (i) a noise reconstructed from a watermarked image (reconstructed noise) (ii) a noise reconstructed from a forged image using a public model to imitate our watermarked image (reconstruction attack, described in Section\u00a03).

The third histogram shows the similarity to completely random noise, representing a baseline comparison.  The results highlight the high similarity between the initial noise and the noise reconstructed from a legitimately watermarked image, while revealing a significant drop in similarity when compared to the forged and random noises.
