Given an instruction, the process begins with generating candidate responses (Search), followed by evaluating these candidates using appropriate verifier combinations (Verify), and concludes with optimizing the model\u2019s output distribution (Feedback). This framework can explain various approaches, from training-based methods like RLHF\u00a0(Ouyang et\u00a0al., 2022a) to inference-based techniques such as OmegaPRM\u00a0(Luo et\u00a0al., 2024b) and Experiential Co-Learning\u00a0(Qian et\u00a0al., 2023). We systematically categorize existing approaches into these three stages in Table\u00a03.", "description": "The figure illustrates the three main stages of verifier engineering: Search, Verify, and Feedback.  The process starts with an instruction, followed by generating multiple candidate responses (Search). Each candidate is then evaluated using various verifiers (Verify), culminating in a feedback loop to refine the model's output distribution (Feedback).  The diagram shows how different existing methods, such as RLHF, OmegaPRM, and Experiential Co-learning, fit into this framework.", "section": "2. Verifier Engineering"}]
