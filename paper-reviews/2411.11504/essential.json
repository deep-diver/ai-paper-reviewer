Traditional data-centric approaches are costly and unsustainable.  This necessitates exploration of novel supervision methods.  The limitations of handcrafted features and the increasing cost of human annotation highlight the need for more automated, scalable approaches to improving model performance.\nThis paper introduces \"verifier engineering,\" a novel post-training paradigm that uses automated verifiers for verification tasks. This process is systematically categorized into three essential stages: search, verify, and feedback.  The paper reviews state-of-the-art research within each stage, demonstrating that verifier engineering can enhance model capabilities by providing more effective supervision signals than traditional methods.  It offers a unified framework covering various approaches, potentially paving the way for achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).", "affiliation": "Chinese Information Processing Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2411.11504/podcast.wav"}
