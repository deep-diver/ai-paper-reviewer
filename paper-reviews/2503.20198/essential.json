Existing text-to-image systems are limited to brief phrases or sentences. **This paper identifies the image tokenizer as a key bottleneck in text generating quality**. State-of-the-art autoregressive generation models need improvement in handling complex or lengthy text inputs, particularly regarding codebook embedding limitations. Existing methods render longer text but lack font control and support limited token lengths.\n\n**LongTextAR, a multi-modal autoregressive model, excels in generating high-quality long-text images** with unprecedented fidelity via a novel binary tokenizer optimized for capturing detailed scene text features. It provides robust controllability, allowing customization of font style, size, color, and alignment. Experiments show it outperforms models such as SD3.5 Large and DALL-E 3 in generating long text accurately and flexibly. The versatility also allows for innovative applications like document/PowerPoint generation.", "affiliation": "Central South University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20198/podcast.wav"}
