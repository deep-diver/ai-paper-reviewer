Versatile editing, good generation, and explainability.", "takeaways": ["MotionCLR, a new attention-based diffusion model, provides comparable motion generation quality to state-of-the-art methods.", "MotionCLR enables versatile, training-free motion editing through simple yet effective manipulation of attention maps.", "The paper clarifies the roles of self- and cross-attention mechanisms in motion generation and editing, enhancing model explainability."], "tldr": "MotionCLR is an innovative method for generating and editing human motion. Unlike previous models that struggle with fine-grained control and lack explainability, MotionCLR utilizes attention mechanisms (specifically self-attention and cross-attention) to achieve precise control over motion generation and editing.  Self-attention focuses on sequential similarity between frames, influencing the order of motion features. Cross-attention establishes word-sequence correspondence, activating relevant timesteps in the motion sequence. This enables various editing methods like motion de-emphasizing, in-place replacement, and example-based generation.  Experiments show MotionCLR generates high-quality motions comparable to existing methods and supports the proposed edits with good explainability.  Additionally, the model demonstrates the potential for action counting and grounded generation using attention maps, effectively addressing cases of hallucination."}
