Unlike previous models that lack explicit word-level text-motion correspondence, MotionCLR models both in-modality (self-attention) and cross-modality (cross-attention) interactions.  Self-attention helps model sequential similarities between motion frames, impacting feature order. Cross-attention identifies fine-grained word-sequence correspondence, activating relevant motion timesteps.  This allows for training-free, interactive motion editing. The researchers demonstrate various editing methods: motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement, example-based generation, and motion sequence shifting.  They also explore action counting and grounded motion generation using attention maps.  Experimental results show MotionCLR achieves comparable generation performance to state-of-the-art methods, with good explainability and editing ability."}
