Four key applications are demonstrated: motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement, motion sequence shifting, and example-based motion generation. Motion (de-)emphasizing involves adjusting the cross-attention values associated with specific action verbs in the input text to increase or decrease the intensity of those actions.  In-place motion replacement substitutes one action with another by replacing the self-attention map of the replacement action with that of the original action.  Motion sequence shifting alters the temporal order of actions by manipulating the cross-attention map, enabling the rearrangement of actions within a sequence. Example-based motion generation leverages the self-attention map to generate diverse motions based on a single example, demonstrating the model's ability to produce variations while retaining key characteristics of the example.
