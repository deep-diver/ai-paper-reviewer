The core of MotionCLR is the CLR block, which consists of four key modules: a 1D convolution layer for timestep injection, a self-attention layer for modeling temporal coherence between motion frames, a cross-attention layer for explicitly modeling fine-grained word-level text-motion correspondence, and a feed-forward network (FFN) layer for channel mixing. The self-attention mechanism, using query (Q), key (K), and value (V) matrices derived from motion features, measures the similarity between motion frames and updates motion features by weighting the most similar frames.  The cross-attention mechanism, using motion features for Q and textual word embeddings for K and V, models fine-grained text-motion correspondence by explicitly calculating similarity between motion frames and words, activating corresponding timesteps in the motion sequence. The mathematical formulations for both attention mechanisms are provided, highlighting the role of softmax operation for feature selection and weight updates. Empirical studies using the sentence \u201ca person jumps\u201d visualize the self-attention and cross-attention maps, showing clear alignment between the word \"jump\" and the corresponding jump actions in the cross-attention map and highlighting similar local motion patterns across multiple jumps in the self-attention map.

The authors acknowledge that completely eliminating hallucinations is difficult and instead focus on providing methods to mitigate and correct them. They demonstrate that providing additional temporal information (temporal grounds) can help guide the model to produce more accurate results when the model's generated motion count doesn't align with the textual prompt.

By incorporating a temporal mask specifying only four jumps, the generated output corrected itself.  Beyond temporal grounding, other editing techniques, such as motion sequence shifting and in-place motion replacement, can also be used to correct errors in both the sequence and semantic aspects of the generated motions.
