The authors emphasize that their method is novel in that it enables natural editing via out-of-modality signals (text editing), achieves comparable generation performance with state-of-the-art methods, and provides a series of interactive editing capabilities without the need for retraining. The key contributions are summarized as the development of an attention-based motion diffusion model with clear modeling of the text-aligned motion generation process, clarifying the role of self- and cross-attention mechanisms, and proposing interactive motion editing methods via manipulating attention maps.

The core of MotionCLR is the CLR block, which comprises four modules: a 1D convolution layer for timestep injection (disentangled from text injection), a self-attention layer for modeling temporal coherence between motion frames, a cross-attention layer for explicit word-level text-motion correspondence, and a feed-forward network (FFN) layer.  The cross-attention layer is crucial for fine-grained text-motion alignment, modeling interactions between each word and every motion frame.  The self-attention layer focuses on capturing sequential similarities between frames. The design emphasizes disentangling text and timestep embeddings for explicit control.  The mathematical formulations of both self-attention and cross-attention mechanisms are detailed, illustrating how the attention maps activate specific time-steps in the motion sequence based on word-level similarities. Empirical studies using attention map visualizations demonstrate alignment between high activation of words and their corresponding actions in the generated motion, supporting the model's explainability.

It introduces four key applications: \n\n1. **Motion Emphasizing/De-emphasizing:** By increasing or decreasing the cross-attention values of specific verbs in the text, the corresponding actions' intensity can be controlled.  This is achieved by directly modifying cross-attention values; increasing values emphasizes the action, while decreasing them de-emphasizes or even erases it.\n2. **In-place Motion Replacement:** This technique allows for replacing one action in a generated motion with another. This is done by replacing the cross-attention map of the edited motion with the corresponding map from the reference motion, ensuring that the replacement happens at the same temporal location. \n3. **Motion Sequence Shifting:** This application enables shifting parts of a generated motion along the timeline. The self-attention map, which models the relationship between frames, is directly manipulated to achieve this. By changing the order of the queries (Q), keys (K), and values (V) in the self-attention mechanism, parts of the motion can be effectively shifted within the sequence. \n4. **Example-based Motion Generation:**  This method uses the self-attention mechanism to generate diverse motions while maintaining the characteristics of an example motion.  It shuffles the order of queries in the self-attention to produce various results. A visualization of this technique shows the diverse generated motions clustering close to the example motion in t-SNE space, indicating both similarity and diversity.\n\nThese methods demonstrate the potential for a comprehensive, training-free, and intuitive approach to motion editing by leveraging the explainability of attention mechanisms.", "first_cons": "The effectiveness of the editing techniques may depend on the complexity of the motion and the precision with which attention maps are manipulated.
