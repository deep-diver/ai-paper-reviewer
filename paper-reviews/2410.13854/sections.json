Existing benchmarks primarily focus on simple image recognition tasks, failing to capture the deeper implications often conveyed in images.  This introduction highlights the limitations of current MLLMs in interpreting images with rich cultural connotations, using the example of Chinese imagery which often embodies richer scenes and deeper implications than their English counterparts.  Chinese traditional landscape paintings, for instance, convey philosophical concepts through artistic techniques not readily apparent to models. Similarly, New Year paintings use symbolism and implication to express wishes for good fortune. This lack of cultural sensitivity makes it difficult for current models to fully grasp the intended meaning. The authors argue for a deeper understanding, emphasizing that understanding Chinese images requires knowledge of the cultural context, which is absent in current MLLM evaluation.", "first_cons": "The introduction focuses primarily on the limitations of current MLLMs without providing concrete examples of specific failures in detail.

It begins by discussing the rapid advancements in MLLMs, highlighting their ability to integrate and interpret information across multiple modalities. The section notes that while MLLMs excel in tasks like image recognition and generation, understanding the deeper implications within images remains a crucial research challenge. Existing benchmarks are criticized for their limitations in evaluating higher-order perception and nuanced understanding, often focusing on specific tasks rather than holistic multimodal reasoning. The section introduces the concept of image implication understanding, which involves recognizing the implicit meanings and deeper nuances in images, something which goes beyond simple image recognition.

The benchmark comprises 698 images and 800 multiple-choice questions across six domains (Life, Art, Society, Politics, Environment, and Chinese Traditional Culture), with six image types (Illustration, Meme, Poster, Single-panel Comic, Multi-panel Comic, and Painting).  The images were manually collected from the Chinese internet, manually reviewed for authenticity, and the answers were manually crafted to ensure the accuracy and cultural relevance of the Chinese context. The data curation process included a three-stage data filtering process (deduplication, text regulation, and visual inspection) resulting in a high-quality dataset of under 1000 images. The annotation process involved multiple rounds of annotation and cross-validation to guarantee accuracy and consistency.

They emphasize that modern globalization has further complicated this interpretation by introducing new layers of meaning through the intertwining of foreign elements with traditional Chinese culture.  The section also discusses the choice of using Chinese traditional paintings for evaluation, highlighting their inherent cultural richness and how they serve as a valuable proxy for assessing a broader understanding of Chinese culture.
