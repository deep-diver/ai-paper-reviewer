Large foundation models offer flexibility but are costly to fine-tune. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like LORA update weights efficiently but can underfit. SVD methods comprehensively update but lack flexibility. The complex nature of medical image segmentation calls for models that are specifically designed to capture detailed, domain-specific features. Large foundation models offer considerable flexibility, yet the cost of fine-tuning these models remains a significant barrier.\n\nThis paper introduces **SALT**, a method that adapts singular values using trainable parameters and low-rank updates. This hybrid approach combines the advantages of LoRA and SVD, enabling effective adaptation without increasing model size or depth. Evaluated on five medical datasets, SALT outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods by 2-5% in Dice with only 3.9% trainable parameters. The proposed approach enables **effective adaptation without relying on increasing model size or depth**.", "affiliation": "Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16055/podcast.wav"}
