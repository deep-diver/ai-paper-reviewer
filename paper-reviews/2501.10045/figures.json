It uses a unified transformer-convolutional generator, combining a MossFormer (a type of transformer) and a recurrent network to process low-resolution mel-spectrograms.  The output of this generator is then fed into a HiFi-GAN generator to create a high-resolution waveform. Three discriminators (MSD, MPD, and MBD) evaluate the generated audio, guiding the training process through adversarial learning.  The overall training objective minimizes both feature matching loss and mel-spectrogram reconstruction loss to achieve high-fidelity audio.", "section": "2.

All spectrograms are derived from the same sample input taken from the VocalSet singing dataset. The figure highlights the superior performance of HiFi-SR in accurately reconstructing the high-resolution details of the original singing voice compared to the NVSR model, as evidenced by the more detailed and structurally accurate spectrogram. This visual representation helps to demonstrate the significant improvement in the high-fidelity speech enhancement achieved by the HiFi-SR model over the baseline NVSR model.", "section": "3.

The y-axis shows the Log-Spectral Distance (LSD) values, a metric measuring the difference between the generated and ground-truth audio. Lower LSD values indicate better performance.
