Unlike traditional methods that treat images as fixed-size grids, FiTv2 views them as dynamic sequences of tokens. This approach allows for seamless handling of various image sizes during training and inference, eliminating biases from image cropping.  FiTv2 incorporates several innovative designs, including Query-Key vector normalization for training stability, an AdaLN-LORA module for efficiency, a rectified flow scheduler for faster convergence, and a Logit-Normal sampler.  Experiments show FiTv2 achieves a 2x faster convergence speed compared to FiT.  Furthermore, FiTv2 demonstrates remarkable adaptability in generating diverse resolutions and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on benchmark datasets, especially in generating high-resolution images (512x512 and above) and handling unusual aspect ratios.  The authors have made the code and models publicly available to encourage further research."}
