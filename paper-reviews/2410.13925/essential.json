Unlike traditional methods that treat images as fixed-resolution grids, FiTv2 views them as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, enabling it to handle diverse resolutions and aspect ratios seamlessly.  FiTv2 includes several upgrades: Query-Key vector normalization for stability, AdaLN-LORA for efficiency, a rectified flow scheduler for faster convergence, and a Logit-Normal sampler.  Experiments show FiTv2 achieves 2x faster convergence than FiT and outperforms state-of-the-art models, especially at higher resolutions.  A post-training method is also presented to adapt a pre-trained model for high-resolution generation. The code and models are publicly available to facilitate further research."}
