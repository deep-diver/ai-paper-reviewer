Smaller models are often less capable, while larger models require significant resources.  There's also a demand for models capable of handling longer contexts. This paper presents EXAONE 3.5, a family of three instruction-tuned LLMs (2.4B, 7.8B, and 32B parameters) designed to address these issues.  They achieve state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, demonstrating exceptional performance in real-world scenarios and long-context understanding. \nThe EXAONE 3.5 models were trained using a two-stage process: pre-training on a massive dataset followed by fine-tuning with instruction data. The researchers also implemented methods to mitigate catastrophic forgetting (the phenomenon where a model forgets previously learned information during training) and data contamination (when test data overlaps with training data).  The results demonstrate the effectiveness of this training approach and the models' ability to handle various tasks, particularly those demanding long-context processing. The models are open-source for research, contributing to broader AI research and potential advancements in various applications.", "affiliation": "LG AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.04862/podcast.wav"}
