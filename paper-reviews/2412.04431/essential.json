Existing models often rely on index-wise tokenization, which restricts scalability and can lead to quantization errors impacting image quality.  Furthermore, training methods like teacher-forcing can introduce inconsistencies between training and inference.\nThe researchers introduced Infinity, a bitwise autoregressive model that tackles these issues. By utilizing a bitwise visual tokenizer, infinite-vocabulary classifier, and a bitwise self-correction mechanism, Infinity significantly improves generation capacity and detail.  The model establishes new benchmarks for autoregressive text-to-image models, outperforming leading diffusion models in multiple evaluation metrics while achieving much faster inference speeds. The use of bitwise tokens offers a potential pathway to more efficient and scalable visual generation.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.04431/podcast.wav"}
