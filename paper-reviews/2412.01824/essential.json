Diffusion models, while dominant, are less adaptable to this in-context learning setting.  Autoregressive models offer a potential solution, but their ability to handle long context sequences is limited, hindering their effectiveness.  Furthermore, existing methods often involve significant information loss during image compression, impacting the quality of generated images.\nThe paper introduces X-Prompt to address these challenges.  **X-Prompt is a novel autoregressive vision-language model designed for efficient in-context image generation.** It incorporates a specialized mechanism to compress information from in-context examples, supporting longer sequences and improved generalization.  **A unified training task for text and image prediction enhances the model's awareness of different tasks**, leading to superior performance across various image generation tasks and the ability to generalize to unseen tasks.  Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01824/podcast.wav"}
