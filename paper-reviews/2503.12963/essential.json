Also, image-based methods have identity distortion with high cost. To solve it, **this paper introduces KDTalker** to combine unsupervised implicit 3D keypoints with a spatiotemporal diffusion model, adapting facial information for diverse poses and fine details. A custom spatiotemporal attention ensures accurate lip sync and enhances efficiency.\n\n**KDTalker** uses implicit 3D deformation keypoints and transformation parameters from audio, capturing lip, expressions, and head poses. Transformed keypoints are used for facial rendering. Unlike 3DMM, KDTalker\u2019s keypoints adapt to facial densities, enhancing expressiveness. Experiments show KDTalker\u2019s SOTA lip sync, pose diversity, & efficiency, offering a new appraoch in virtual reality & digital human creation.", "affiliation": "University of Liverpool", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.12963/podcast.wav"}
