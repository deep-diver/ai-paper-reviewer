The fine-tuning process aims to reduce toxicity in the model's generated text while maintaining relevance to the prompt.  Following this fine-tuning, the Max-Margin Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) algorithm is applied to extract the reward models from the fine-tuned LLMs.  This involves generating paired samples, initializing a reward model based on the LLM's architecture and a linear layer, and then iteratively refining the model using a loss function that penalizes toxic outputs more heavily than non-toxic outputs.
