It consists of three modules: an Action Proposer that suggests actions from the input frames, an Action Corrector to filter out errors, and an Action Merger that combines action sequences from multiple frame batches.  The figure illustrates the architecture of the DFA, showcasing the flow of data and operations through these three modules.", "section": "III.

It shows the different processing stages involved: First, a Frame Difference Localizer identifies UI changes between consecutive frames.  Then, a Frame Difference Descriptor generates textual descriptions of these changes. Finally, an Action Proposer and Action Corrector leverage vision-language models to interpret these descriptions and generate the final action sequence.  The DiffF method differs from the Direct Frame-Based Approach by explicitly incorporating UI changes, enabling a comparison of the effectiveness of these different approaches.", "section": "III.

The DF approach directly inputs sampled video frames into Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to generate action sequences. The DiffF approach first detects frame differences using computer vision techniques before using VLMs to interpret the changes and generate sequences.  Both architectures involve an Action Proposer, Action Corrector, and (for DF) an Action Merger to refine the action sequences.", "section": "III. Methodology"}]
