Directly integrating expert models is also challenging because of representation gaps and imbalanced optimization. \n\nThis paper introduces Chimera, a pipeline integrating pre-trained expert models to enhance LMMs for domain-specific tasks.  Chimera uses a progressive training strategy and a novel Generalist-Specialist Collaboration Masking (GSCM) mechanism to address optimization issues.  The results show Chimera achieves state-of-the-art performance on various challenging benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness in improving LMMs' adaptability to domain-specific tasks.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.05983/podcast.wav"}
