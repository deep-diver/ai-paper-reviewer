[{"content": "| Average Rank Accuracy | Output Quality |\n|---|---| \n| Omegance | 93.94% | 81.98% |", "caption": "Table 1: Results of user study on granularity control effectiveness and output quality of Omegance.", "description": "This table presents the results of a user study evaluating the effectiveness of the proposed Omegance method in controlling the granularity of generated images and its impact on overall image quality.  The study involved two parts: Part 1 assessed the accuracy of participants in ranking images based on their level of granularity (high, medium, low), indicating how well Omegance allows control over this aspect. Part 2 measured the preference for images generated with Omegance versus those from the base model, gauging whether the method improves or maintains image quality.  The results show both the success rate of granularity ranking and the percentage of times Omegance-generated images were preferred or deemed equally good as the baseline, providing a comprehensive assessment of the method's impact on both granularity and quality.", "section": "4.
