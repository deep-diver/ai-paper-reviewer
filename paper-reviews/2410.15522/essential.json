RMs are crucial for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences, but most existing benchmarks focus on English. M-REWARDBENCH evaluates RMs across 23 diverse languages on various tasks, including chat, safety, reasoning, and translation. The results reveal a substantial performance gap between English and other languages, highlighting a critical limitation of current RMs.  The study also shows that RM performance is influenced by translation quality and language resource availability.  High-resource languages generally show better results.  The researchers publicly released the M-REWARDBENCH dataset and code, promoting further investigation into multilingual RM evaluation and improvement. This work is important because it addresses the critical need for LLMs that align with the values of a diverse global population and not just resource-rich languages."}
