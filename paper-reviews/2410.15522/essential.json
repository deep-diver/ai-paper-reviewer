The study systematically evaluates various RMs across 23 typologically diverse languages, encompassing tasks related to chat, safety, reasoning, and translation.  A key finding is a significant performance gap between English and non-English languages, showing that RM preferences vary substantially across languages. The researchers also found that better translation quality improves RM performance, and high-resource languages yield better results.  This highlights a critical need for further research into cross-lingual RM development and evaluation.  The M-REWARDBENCH dataset and code are publicly released to facilitate future research in this area."}
