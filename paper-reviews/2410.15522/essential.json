Currently, most RMs are trained and tested primarily using English data, limiting our understanding of their performance in diverse linguistic contexts.  M-REWARDBENCH addresses this limitation by evaluating RMs across a wide range of 23 languages, covering various tasks such as chat, safety, reasoning, and translation. The study reveals considerable performance disparities between English and non-English languages, highlighting the need for more robust multilingual RMs.  It also demonstrates a strong correlation between translation quality and RM performance, emphasizing the importance of high-quality translations in evaluating and developing multilingual models.  The findings underscore the influence of linguistic features such as resource availability, language family, and script on model performance, offering valuable insights into the challenges of multilingual RM development. The study releases the M-REWARDBENCH dataset and codebase, fostering further research in this crucial area. The benchmark itself is a significant contribution, providing researchers with a valuable tool to systematically evaluate the performance of reward models in various languages and contexts.  The detailed analyses of the results offer practical guidance for improving the robustness and cross-lingual generalizability of future reward models and LLMs."}
