It explains how reward models (RMs) act as intermediaries, aligning the LLM's outputs with human preferences by incorporating human feedback into the language modeling process.  The process is described as a preference learning stage where an instruction-fine-tuned model (IFT) gets further aligned with human values. This is achieved through the provision of preference data\u2014instances consisting of a prompt and a pair of ranked responses (chosen and rejected).  The goal of this process is to maximize a reward function that can then be used to refine the LLM during training. The section then outlines three different approaches to reward model evaluation: Classifier RMs explicitly train a separate reward model and evaluate it; Implicit RMs directly optimize the policy based on preference data; and Generative RMs use generated outputs to judge between responses and serve as feedback mechanism, offering a wide range of evaluation techniques and models.", "first_cons": "The section lacks a detailed explanation of the complexities involved in training and optimizing reward models.
