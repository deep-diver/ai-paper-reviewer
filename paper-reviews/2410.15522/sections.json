It explains how preference learning, using human feedback in the form of ranked responses to prompts, is crucial for aligning LLMs with human values and objectives. The process involves feeding preference data (prompt, chosen response, rejected response) into a reward model, which can be trained explicitly as a classifier or regressor, or implicitly by direct policy optimization, to learn to predict the relative quality of different responses.  Three main approaches to Reward Model training are described:  Classifier RMs explicitly predict preference; Generative RMs use LLM generations to judge responses; and Implicit RMs directly optimize the policy on preference data without an explicit intermediate reward model.  The section highlights the significance of this training method for controlling and improving the capabilities of LLMs, emphasizing its pivotal role in achieving alignment between the model and human preferences.
