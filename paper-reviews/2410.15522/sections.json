Currently, most RMs are trained and evaluated primarily in English, leaving their performance in multilingual settings largely unexplored. This Introduction highlights the critical need to understand how RMs function in diverse linguistic contexts, given the global reach and increasing use of LLMs.  The lack of research in multilingual RM evaluation is a significant gap, especially considering the importance of aligning LLMs with the values of a diverse global population, not just English speakers. The authors emphasize the limited existing work on multilingual preference alignment, specifically pointing out that existing benchmarks like RewardBench are solely in English and do not encompass tasks related to multilinguality, such as translation or culturally nuanced requests.

It begins by explaining how preference learning, a crucial step in aligning LLMs with human values, uses human feedback (in the form of ranked response pairs) to improve model behavior.  The process involves training a reward model (RM), which learns to score responses according to their alignment with preferences.  The section details three distinct approaches to creating RMs: Classifier RMs, which use human feedback to train a classifier that distinguishes good from bad responses; Implicit RMs, which optimize the policy directly using preference data; and Generative RMs, which use model generations to judge response quality.
