It begins by describing the attention block, a fundamental component of transformer-based large language models (LLMs). The attention block utilizes three weight matrices (WQ, WK, WV) to transform the input data (X) into query, key, and value states. The attention mechanism's computational complexity is highlighted as quadratic (O(n\u00b2)) during the prefill phase, stemming from the computation of the product QKT, where n is the sequence length. This quadratic complexity is a significant performance bottleneck, especially when dealing with extensive visual content.  The section then transitions to the decoding phase, where the computational complexity shifts to a linear one (O(n)) due to the utilization of the key-value (KV) cache. However, fetching this KV cache from memory becomes a major bottleneck as sequence length grows.  The section emphasizes that both the prefill phase and the decoding phase present significant computational and memory challenges, respectively, that need to be addressed to achieve efficient inference.  The paper sets the stage to introduce its solution by highlighting the importance of understanding these challenges in the context of handling the large amounts of visual tokens generated by high-resolution images or videos.
