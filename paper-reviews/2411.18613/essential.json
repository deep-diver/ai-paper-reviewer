Existing methods relying on geometric constraints or depth maps often produce inaccurate results when generating novel views, especially from partially observed scenes.  Current data-driven approaches are limited by the scarcity of high-quality multi-view video datasets for training robust generative priors.\nThis paper introduces CAT4D, a method that uses a multi-view video diffusion model trained on diverse real and synthetic datasets to transform a single monocular video into a multi-view video. This allows for novel view synthesis and dynamic scene reconstruction using a deformable 3D Gaussian representation. CAT4D achieves competitive performance on 4D reconstruction benchmarks, showcasing its ability to generate high-quality results from various types of video input.  **Its ability to disentangle camera and time control for generating scenes, and handle both static and dynamic scenes makes it highly versatile.**", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2411.18613/podcast.wav"}
