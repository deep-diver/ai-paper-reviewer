There is a need for more scalable and generalizable solutions that can bridge the gap between synthetic training and real-world application.\n\nThis paper introduces AETHER, **a framework trained on synthetic 4D data, achieving zero-shot generalization to real-world tasks.** AETHER jointly optimizes 4D reconstruction, action-conditioned prediction, and visual planning. A robust pipeline annotates synthetic data. This enables accuracy comparable to SOTA while enabling planning.
