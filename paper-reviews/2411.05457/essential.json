{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers because it **introduces a novel dataset, TESORO**, which is the first to combine self-admitted technical debt comments with their corresponding source code. This allows for more accurate and comprehensive analysis of technical debt and opens new avenues for research in this field. It also **presents a comprehensive pipeline for data enrichment**, enabling researchers to efficiently create similar datasets for different programming languages and software systems. The empirical evaluations using various machine learning models demonstrate that the dataset improves the performance of technical debt detection methods.", "summary": "Enriched dataset TESORO improves technical debt detection by combining self-admitted comments and Java source code, advancing state-of-the-art models.", "takeaways": ["TESORO dataset combines self-admitted technical debt comments with source code for improved detection.", "Including source code significantly enhances the accuracy of technical debt prediction.", "Code-based machine learning models outperform others in detecting technical debt from code alone."], "tldr": "Technical debt (TD) detection traditionally relies heavily on textual cues like comments, but these can be outdated or inconsistent with the code.  This paper addresses this limitation by focusing on **a novel approach that integrates both comments and the associated source code**.  This is challenging because analyzing large codebases is computationally expensive and requires sophisticated methods. Existing datasets also lack this crucial code context.\nThe paper presents **TESORO**, a new dataset created using a pipeline that extracts self-admitted TD comments, links them to relevant code snippets, and has these annotations verified by human annotators. It then uses various machine learning models to demonstrate that incorporating code context greatly improves the accuracy of TD detection.  Furthermore, the study investigates the effectiveness of different models for detecting TD directly from code, without relying on comments.", "affiliation": "Hanoi University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}}
