It uses a three-step process: (a) **Remember:** storing user-specific information (e.g., images and descriptions of concepts) in a key-value database; (b) **Retrieve:** retrieving relevant information from the database using a multimodal retriever when the user initiates a conversation; and (c) **Generate:** using the retrieved information along with the user query to generate a personalized knowledge-augmented response via the MLLM.  This approach allows real-time concept updates without model retraining, handling infinite visual concepts.
