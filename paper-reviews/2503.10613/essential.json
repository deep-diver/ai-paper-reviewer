Existing methods often rely on expensive exploration or lack accurate cost estimations. Current text-to-image models struggle with composite instructions that require multiple adjustments while preserving other parts. Large Language Models are useful for decomposing the task, but finding the toolpath (efficient and successful tool use) is difficult because of the high cost to train and computational costs. Therefore, there is a need for a cost-sensitive agent that can decompose a multi-turn task into subtasks.\n\nThis paper introduces \"**COSTA*\", a cost-sensitive toolpath agent that combines LLMs and A* search to find cost-effective tool paths for multi-turn image editing. CoSTA* uses LLMs to create a subtask tree and prunes a graph of AI tools for the given task. It then conducts A* search on the smaller subgraph to find the tool path and balances the total cost and quality to guide the A* search. Each subtask's output is evaluated by a vision-language model, where a failure updates the tool's cost and quality on the subtask. COSTA* automatically switches between modalities across subtasks and outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of cost and quality.
