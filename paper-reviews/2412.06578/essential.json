This limitation arises from the complex model architectures, iterative denoising processes, and the computational overhead of classifier-free guidance. The challenge lies in making these methods efficient enough for resource-constrained mobile environments. \n\nThis paper introduces MoViE, addressing these challenges by employing several optimizations. The authors optimized the model's architecture by using a lightweight autoencoder, incorporated a multimodal guidance distillation technique to speed up classifier-free guidance, and introduced a novel adversarial distillation scheme to reduce the number of sampling steps to one. These combined optimizations enable video editing at 12 frames per second on a mobile phone, demonstrating a significant improvement in computational efficiency and on-device feasibility.", "affiliation": "Qualcomm AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.06578/podcast.wav"}
