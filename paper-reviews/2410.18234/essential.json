Current LLMs generate text one word at a time, which is slow.  This paper explores 'speculative decoding', where multiple possible next words are generated and the best one is selected using a target model. The novelty lies in using multiple 'draft' models to generate these possibilities independently. The authors present a new two-step method:  first, importance sampling is applied to select one intermediate word from drafts; second, speculative sampling selects the final word from a target model.  Theoretical analysis provides conditions for perfect acceptance rates (selecting one of the suggested words).  Experiments demonstrated improved efficiency and token rates, especially using weighted importance sampling, even when draft models have different probability distributions."}
