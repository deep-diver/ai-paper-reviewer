Current LLMs process text one word at a time, which is inefficient. To speed things up, the researchers explore 'speculative decoding,' where multiple possible next words are generated and then evaluated by the main model.  They improve on existing speculative decoding techniques by using multiple 'draft' models (smaller models that generate word suggestions) simultaneously. This allows parallel processing of multiple word suggestions, leading to greater efficiency.  The key improvement is a new method for selecting the best suggestion from the drafts \u2013 this method is proven theoretically optimal for two identical draft models, and consistently improves speed in experiments with more drafts. The researchers provide experimental results showing significant performance gains on several tasks compared to existing methods. The paper also offers a new, faster algorithm for practical implementation.  This work is crucial for the wider adoption of LLMs in applications that need real-time processing, such as chatbots or virtual assistants."}
