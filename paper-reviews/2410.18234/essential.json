{"reason": "This paper introduces multi-draft speculative sampling, improving large language model (LLM) decoding efficiency.  It provides a canonical two-step architecture for optimal token selection and theoretical analysis demonstrating improvements over existing methods.", "takeaways": ["Multi-draft speculative sampling improves LLM decoding efficiency by using multiple draft models to generate candidate tokens.", "An optimal token selection scheme can be decomposed into a two-step process: importance sampling followed by single-draft speculative sampling.", "Theoretical analysis provides insights into optimal acceptance probabilities and a new token selection scheme based on weighted importance sampling."], "tldr": "This paper proposes a novel multi-draft speculative sampling method for faster LLM decoding. It introduces a two-step optimal token selection architecture (importance sampling and single-draft speculative sampling), offering theoretical analysis and demonstrating significant improvements in block efficiency and token rates, particularly when draft sequences have non-identical distributions. This method improves decoding speed and efficiency for LLMs."}
