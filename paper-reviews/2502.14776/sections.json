[{"heading_title": "SurveyX Overview", "details": {"summary": "**SurveyX** is a novel system for **automated survey generation**, addressing limitations in LLM-based approaches. It innovatively combines **online reference retrieval**, a pre-processing method called **AttributeTree**, and a **re-polishing process** to enhance survey composition. By decomposing the process into **Preparation and Generation phases**, SurveyX aims to improve content quality and citation accuracy. The system leverages LLMs and RAG efficiently, using attribute trees, and enhancing context, surpassing existing solutions.  Experimental results confirm SurveyX's superiority in content quality and citation quality, making it a valuable tool for researchers facing information overload."}}, {"heading_title": "Retrieval System", "details": {"summary": "The retrieval system is a core component, it significantly impacts the quality of the generated surveys. **Efficient retrieval** is crucial due to the vast amount of available literature. The system should incorporate methods for **expanding keywords** to ensure coverage. A two-step filtering process refines the results. This emphasizes the need to balance recall (capturing all relevant papers) and precision (filtering out irrelevant ones). **Semantic relevance** is a key metric, suggesting embedding models and potentially LLMs for fine-grained filtering are used. The consideration of both offline and online data sources showcases a commitment to efficiency and timeliness. Effective retrieval enables high-quality surveys approaching human expert performance."}}, {"heading_title": "Outline Methods", "details": {"summary": "While the paper doesn't explicitly use \"Outline Methods\" as a distinct heading, the creation of a structured survey is **heavily reliant on outlining**. SURVEYX emphasizes **outline generation as a critical step**, employing 'Outline Optimization' to produce logically rigorous and clear structures, vital for coherence.  The method synthesizes LLM generated hints, removing redundancy using a separate-then-reorganize' approach. This indicates a thought process **similar to human outlining**, ensuring logical flow and comprehensive coverage before deep content generation, thereby enhancing the quality and readability of the final survey."}}, {"heading_title": "RAG Rewriting", "details": {"summary": "The RAG-based rewriting module addresses content consistency and citation accuracy in generated surveys. It works by retrieving relevant reference materials from the attribute forest using initial draft paragraphs as queries. This is followed by constructing a prompt using these materials to rewrite the paragraph using LLMs. The rewriting process aims to improve content consistency, remove irrelevant citations, and add highly relevant ones, **significantly enhancing citation quality** and ensuring context relevance. This module plays a crucial role to maintain the integrity and reliability of the automated surveys."}}, {"heading_title": "SurveyX Results", "details": {"summary": "Based on the text, SURVEYX **outperforms** existing automated survey generation systems and **approaches human expert performance**, specifically in content and citation quality. Key to SURVEYX is the ability to **retrieve high-quality, relevant references** and utilize them effectively for survey composition. Results reveal that **converting reference content into an attribute tree** enables the LLM to better organize information, improving outline coherence and content depth, thus **reducing reliance on internal knowledge** and promoting external knowledge integration. Additionally, a RAG-based rewriting module helps **enhance the survey's citation quality**. These findings highlight SURVEYX's potential as a valuable tool for academic survey automation, offering a substantial performance boost. The paper also points to the future improvement scope such as retrieval algorithms to match human retrieval level. Finally, all ablation experiments point to a large performance boost."}}]
