The work also opens up exciting avenues for further investigation into one-shot avatar generation, improving the efficiency and realism of digital avatars.", "summary": "One-shot image to realistic, animatable talking avatar!  Novel pipeline uses diffusion models and a hybrid 3DGS-mesh representation, achieving seamless generalization and precise control.", "takeaways": ["A novel pipeline generates photorealistic, animatable talking avatars from a single image, pushing the boundaries of current methods.", "The use of pose-guided image-to-video diffusion models and a tightly coupled 3DGS-mesh representation enables seamless generalization to novel gestures and expressions.", "The proposed method effectively overcomes challenges in complex dynamic modeling and generalization to novel gestures and expressions, significantly advancing avatar creation technology."], "tldr": "Creating realistic and animatable talking avatars typically requires extensive video data, a limitation that hinders applications like AR/VR and digital humans.  Existing methods often struggle with precise control of expressions and seamless generalization to novel gestures.  This research tackles the challenge of constructing a whole-body talking avatar from a single image, a task with broad implications for various fields.\nThe proposed method leverages the power of **recent advances in pose-guided video diffusion models** to generate pseudo-labels for training.  It introduces a novel **3DGS-mesh hybrid avatar representation** to handle inconsistencies in these pseudo-labels and address dynamic modeling challenges.  Careful use of perceptual-based losses and key regularizations improves the accuracy and expressiveness of the generated avatars.  The results demonstrate photorealistic avatars exhibiting natural movements and expressions are achievable from a single image.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.01106/podcast.wav"}
