The comparison uses five common metrics: Mean Squared Error (MSE), L1 distance, Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS). Lower MSE and L1 scores, and higher PSNR and SSIM scores indicate better performance, while a lower LPIPS score reflects better perceptual similarity to the ground truth. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance across all five metrics, signifying improved realism and 3D consistency.", "section": "4. Experiments"}]
