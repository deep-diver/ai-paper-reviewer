This limits their scalability and real-world applicability. \nThe proposed Collaborative Decoding (CoDe) addresses these issues. **CoDe partitions the multi-scale inference into a collaboration between a large and a small model.** The large model generates low-frequency content, while the small model refines high-frequency details. **This division significantly reduces computational redundancy and parameter demands,** leading to substantial improvements in efficiency without sacrificing image quality. **CoDe achieves a 1.7x speedup and 50% memory reduction** compared to the original VAR model, establishing a new benchmark for efficient high-quality image generation.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.17787/podcast.wav"}
