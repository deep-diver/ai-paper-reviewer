ObjCtrl-2.5D, as a training-free approach, shows promising improvement in object motion control compared to prior training-free methods, PEEKABOO\u00a0[19] and FreeTraj\u00a0[32], as indicated by ObjMC scores. Although there remains room for improvement compared to training-based methods such as DragNUWA\u00a0[64] and DragAnything\u00a0[58], ObjCtrl-2.5D offers more versatile object control, as demonstrated in Figure\u00a01 and Figure\u00a06.", "description": "Table 1 presents a quantitative comparison of different video generation methods on two datasets: DAVIS [31] and the newly introduced ObjCtrl-Test.  The metrics used are Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance (FID), Fr\u00e9chet Video Distance (FVD), and Object Motion Control (ObjMC) error. The table highlights that ObjCtrl-2.5D, a training-free method, shows significant improvement in object motion control accuracy (as measured by ObjMC) compared to other training-free methods like PEEKABOO [19] and FreeTraj [32]. While still slightly behind training-based methods (DragNUWA [64] and DragAnything [58]) in terms of overall accuracy, ObjCtrl-2.5D demonstrates greater versatility in controlling object movement, as shown in Figures 1 and 6 of the paper.", "section": "4.
