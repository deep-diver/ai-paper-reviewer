The core idea is to use existing theorems in a formal mathematical library (Mathlib) and systematically modify them through symbolic manipulations \u2013 essentially, creating variations of existing theorems. This process significantly expands the amount of training data available for LLMs. The authors use two main techniques in their symbolic mutation: 'rw' (rewriting) and 'apply'. They pre-train and fine-tune LLMs on this enlarged dataset, achieving notable improvements. The approach shows a 5% improvement on an in-distribution benchmark and 2.5% on an out-of-distribution benchmark, indicating that the method is effective and robust. The study also provides a detailed analysis of the generated data and the training process.  This work addresses the critical challenge of data scarcity in neural theorem proving, offering a promising new strategy for advancing the field."}
