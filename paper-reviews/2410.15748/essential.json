It does this by creating new theorems through a process called 'symbolic mutation,' which involves manipulating existing theorems using symbolic rules.  The researchers used the Lean theorem prover and its Mathlib library (a large collection of formalized math theorems) as the foundation for their work.  Alchemy produced a large number of new theorems (millions, compared to the existing tens of thousands).  These new theorems were then used to train large language models (LLMs).  The results demonstrated a noticeable performance improvement on standard benchmarks for theorem proving, both for theorems similar to the ones used for training (in-distribution) and for theorems of a different type (out-of-distribution), highlighting the technique's potential value."}
