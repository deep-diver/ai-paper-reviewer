It highlights the difficulty of writing formal proofs, even for experts, and the limitations of existing approaches.  Several research efforts using neural models to automate proof generation are mentioned, but these methods face limitations due to the scarcity of available formal data.  The section contrasts the approaches of using natural language processing (autoformalization) to translate problems into a formal language with the more direct approach of creating theorems in symbolic space. Autoformalization, while yielding promising results, is highlighted as being labor-intensive and costly. The creation of synthetic data in the symbolic space is introduced as a promising way to alleviate data scarcity. The section mentions previous work using symbolic rules to directly generate theorems, but these methods are restricted to specific mathematical domains.

It starts by identifying invocable theorems within Mathlib that can be used to rewrite or apply to a candidate theorem.  This identification process utilizes two primary Lean tactics: `rw` (rewrite) and `apply`.  These tactics are employed to create variations of the candidate theorem by substituting terms with equivalent forms or logical antecedents.  The process also generates the corresponding proof for the mutated theorem, ensuring correctness via Lean's verification process.  This data synthesis is then used to augment existing theorem datasets for training large language models (LLMs) in neural theorem proving, aiming to enhance their performance. The method carefully outlines the steps involved in statement generation, proof generation and verification, and model training, providing a structured approach to data augmentation for neural theorem provers.", "first_cons": "The method heavily relies on the Lean theorem prover and Leandojo, a tool for interacting with Lean.

Two widely used benchmarks are employed: the held-out test split of Mathlib, which shares similar characteristics to the training data, and miniF2F, a more challenging benchmark containing competition-level problems with a distinct distribution.  The data synthesis pipeline itself uses the Lean theorem prover and generates variants for each candidate theorem in Mathlib by applying symbolic manipulation tactics, effectively increasing the dataset size significantly. Models are trained using a continual pretraining approach on a mixture of human-written and synthetic theorems followed by fine-tuning with a proofstep prediction objective.  The results demonstrate a consistent improvement in the theorem-proving capabilities of the LLMs, particularly on the miniF2F benchmark, which highlights the ability of the synthetic data to improve performance on out-of-distribution problems.
