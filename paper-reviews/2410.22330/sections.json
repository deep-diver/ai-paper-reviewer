Despite their success, the underlying mechanisms and inductive biases driving VLMs remain largely a mystery. This paper specifically investigates how VLMs represent tasks, focusing on a specific type of representation known as **task vectors**. Prior research has explored task vectors in language-only and vision-only models, observing that models conditioned on in-context learning (ICL) examples contain token representations that encode task information. This study expands on this, investigating the internal task representations of VLMs and how they handle tasks specified through various means, including examples and instructions, using text or image inputs.", "first_cons": "The underlying mechanisms and inductive biases that drive VLMs remain a mystery.", "first_pros": "VLMs are successful in tackling various computer vision tasks through text.", "keypoints": ["VLMs' internal structures and inductive biases are still largely unknown.", "This paper investigates task vectors, a specific type of representation within VLMs.", "Prior work indicates that task information is encoded in token representations within ICL examples.", "The study explores task specifications using examples or instructions with text or image inputs.", "VLMs are multi-purpose models solving various computer vision tasks through text"], "second_cons": "The inductive biases that drive VLMs remain a mystery.", "second_pros": "Vision-and-language models (VLMs) are multi-purpose models.", "summary": "This paper investigates the internal representations of vision-and-language models (VLMs) and how they encode task representations, focusing on task vectors derived from in-context learning examples and instructions."}}, {"page_end_idx": 3, "page_start_idx": 2, "section_number": 2, "section_title": "CROSS-MODAL TASK VECTORS", "details": {"details": "This section explores how vision-and-language models (VLMs) encode tasks using **cross-modal task vectors**.  It demonstrates that similar tasks receive similar vector representations regardless of input modality (text or image) or specification type (examples or instructions).  The process of answer generation is consistent across modalities. **Cross-modal transfer** is demonstrated by computing task vectors in one modality and applying them to queries in another, showing improvements in performance.  **Ensembling exemplar and instruction-based task vectors** further enhances representation.
