{"importance": "This paper is crucial for AI researchers working on language models and model editing.  It reveals critical limitations of current editing methods, challenges existing assumptions, and highlights potential safety risks. This opens new avenues for research focusing on more robust and reliable editing techniques, especially concerning the preservation of general model capabilities and safety.", "summary": "Contrary to popular belief, current language model editing techniques cause inevitable performance decline and safety issues when scaling edits, urging the need for more practical methods.", "takeaways": ["Existing language model editing methods significantly reduce model performance and safety as the number of edits increases.", "Instruction-tuned models are more resistant to performance degradation from editing, while larger models show better robustness than smaller ones.", "Current editing methods are unsuitable for large-scale knowledge updates within language models."], "tldr": "This research comprehensively evaluates the effectiveness and safety of various language model editing methods.  The key finding is that, despite improvements in reliability, generalization, and locality,  existing methods cause unavoidable performance drops and safety compromises as the number of edits grows.  Instruction-tuned models and larger models proved more robust, but even they eventually suffer from decreased performance and safety risks at a large scale. The study concludes that current methods are insufficient for extensive knowledge updates, underscoring the need for further research into more practical and secure editing techniques."}
