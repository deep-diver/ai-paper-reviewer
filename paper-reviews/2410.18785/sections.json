It begins by defining *model editing*, focusing on the precise alteration of knowledge within a language model without affecting unrelated knowledge. This is typically represented as editing knowledge tuples of the form (subject, relation, object). The process involves inserting new tuples to replace existing ones, aiming for precise control over the model's behavior. The section then defines the concept of a model's *general abilities*,  highlighting that a comprehensive evaluation should consider aspects like world knowledge, reasoning, common sense, and coding capabilities, rather than just focused metrics like reliability, generalization, and locality that are often used in model editing evaluations.  Finally, it explains the concept of *sequential editing* where edits are applied successively, requiring a balance between retaining original knowledge and integrating new updates, which presents unique challenges not addressed by existing studies which tend to focus on a single edit. The formal definition of sequential editing involves editing operations being performed iteratively on a model to update knowledge tuples, resulting in a chain of modifications applied to the model parameters.

Instruction-tuned models exhibited slower performance decline, and larger models were generally more resistant to the detrimental effects of editing than smaller models. Notably, even with a relatively small number of edits, the safety of the model could be compromised.  Finally, the \"muting effect\" is observed when models undergo an extremely large number of sequential edits (up to 10,000).  This results in the model producing empty strings or nonsensical output.
