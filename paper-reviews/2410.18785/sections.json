Model editing, the core focus, is described as a technique to precisely modify LLM behavior on specific facts without affecting unrelated samples. The process typically involves editing knowledge tuples, represented as (subject, relation, object) triplets, where a new object replaces the original one.  The evaluation of editing methods traditionally centers on reliability, generalization, and locality (specificity).  However, the paper points out that the existing methods largely focus on these three dimensions, neglecting to consider the impact on the overall general abilities of the model, which is crucial for real-world applications.  The section defines sequential editing, distinguishing between single and batch editing, providing a formal definition for the sequential case. The definition includes the concept of sequential edit operations E = {e1, e2,..., en} where an editing operation e = (s, r, o, o*) is denoted, which transforms an original tuple (s, r, o) to a modified tuple (s, r, o*). This formal framework sets the stage for a deeper examination of how these edits affect the model's broader capabilities in the subsequent sections.", "first_cons": "The definition of sequential editing lacks clarity on how the model is updated after each edit.
