Their large multistage image encoders and memory modules contribute to high latency.  This is a significant obstacle for real-world applications requiring on-device processing.\nThe paper introduces EfficientTAMs, lightweight models that address these limitations.  **It replaces the complex image encoder with a simpler, more efficient Vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT), and it introduces a memory module with a faster cross-attention method.**  The results show that these improvements achieve comparable accuracy to SAM 2 but with a significant speed increase (approximately 2x on A100 GPUs and 2.4x parameter reduction) and robust performance even on mobile devices (~10 FPS on iPhone 15 Pro Max).", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2411.18933/podcast.wav"}
