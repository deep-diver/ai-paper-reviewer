The core challenge lies in effectively encoding long text conditions and ensuring accurate alignment between the generated images and the detailed textual input.  While large language models (LLMs) offer the potential to handle longer sequences, contrastive pre-training encoders like CLIP possess a key advantage: their text encoders are specifically trained to align with images, potentially offering superior alignment between text representations and generated images.

Stable Diffusion is mentioned as a significant model using a VAE to compress the image into a latent variable z, and CLIP to encode the text prompt p.  Preference models are introduced as a means to refine T2I alignment through human preference feedback, and reward fine-tuning is presented as a technique for training these models.  The section highlights that existing preference models, typically built on CLIP, are limited by the maximum input length of CLIP, impacting their use with long text descriptions.", "first_cons": "The explanation of diffusion models is highly technical and may be difficult to grasp for readers without a strong background in machine learning.", "first_pros": "The section clearly defines key concepts related to diffusion models and preference optimization for T2I alignment.

The core idea is *segment-level encoding*, where long texts are divided into smaller segments (e.g., sentences), each encoded separately, and then these segment embeddings are combined.  The initial approach of direct concatenation proved ineffective due to the repetition of special token embeddings (<sot>, <eot>, <pad>) from each segment.  To address this, the authors experimented with different strategies for handling these tokens and found that removing `<eot>` tokens and replacing `<pad>` tokens with a unique `<pad*>` token while keeping all `<sot>` tokens yielded the best results.

The text-relevant part focuses on how well the generated image matches the text description, while the text-irrelevant part captures other visual aspects, like aesthetics, that are unrelated to the textual description.  The authors find that the text-irrelevant part often leads to overfitting during model fine-tuning. To mitigate this issue, they propose a reweighting strategy where they assign different weights to these two components during the training process.  They analyze the scoring mechanisms of preference models and find that the text-irrelevant part often leads to overfitting during model training, which they measure using a projection scalar (\u03b7) and find that \u03b7 > 0.4 for CLIP and \u03b7 > 0.6 for others. The authors discover a strong positive scalar projection onto V(common direction), indicating the existence of a cone effect, which commonly occurs in contrastive training models.  To mitigate the overfitting caused by the text-irrelevant component, they introduce a re-weighting strategy that assigns different weights to the text-relevant and text-irrelevant parts, thereby enhancing the alignment between the text and generated images.

The analysis of the score decomposition provides valuable insights into how CLIP-based preference models work and why text-irrelevant parts often contribute to overfitting during training. The authors find that this is due to a common direction V in the text embedding space, which is identified using a projection scalar (\u03b7).  By separating the text-relevant and text-irrelevant components of the preference score and applying a re-weighting strategy, the method addresses this overfitting problem and improves the alignment between the generated image and the text description, ultimately leading to better overall image quality.
