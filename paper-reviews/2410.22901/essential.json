Existing methods either struggle with exaggerated facial expressions or compromise model generalization.  Furthermore, many methods require optimizing all model parameters, hindering compatibility with existing models.  \n\nHelloMeme tackles these issues by introducing adapters into text-to-image models, specifically optimizing the attention mechanism related to 2D feature maps. This method uses spatial knitting attentions to effectively integrate high-level conditions (head poses, facial expressions) with fidelity-rich details from a reference image.  **The approach preserves the base model's generalization capability and is compatible with SD1.5 and its derivatives.**  Experiments show significant performance improvements on meme video generation, showcasing the effectiveness of this novel technique.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}}
