Unlike previous models that handled protein sequences and structures separately, DPLM-2 uses a multimodal approach.  It converts 3D protein structures into discrete tokens, allowing a language model to learn and generate both sequences and structures simultaneously.  The model was trained on both experimental and high-quality synthetic data, learning the joint distribution of sequence and structure.  It shows improved performance in various tasks including protein folding (predicting 3D structure from sequence), inverse folding (predicting sequence from structure), and motif scaffolding (designing a protein structure with a specific motif).  The results demonstrate that DPLM-2 generates highly compatible sequences and structures and performs competitively in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, DPLM-2 provides structure-aware representations for improved predictive tasks, showcasing its versatility as a multimodal protein foundation model."}
