Generative protein modeling aims to create new proteins by understanding and modeling both sequences and structures.  Recent progress has seen significant advancements in protein structure-based generative modeling using diffusion models and in sequence-based generative modeling using large-scale protein language models. Diffusion models have achieved success in generating protein structures, while large language models, trained on vast evolutionary-scale sequence databases, excel at sequence-based tasks. However, current methods often employ separate models for each modality (sequence or structure), hindering their ability to capture the intricate relationships between them, which is crucial for many protein engineering applications.
