Existing methods are limited to static image-based understanding and cannot model dynamic visual cues present in videos. This paper addresses the limitation by proposing a one-shot learning framework that enables subject-aware question answering from a single video for each subject. \n\nThe paper introduces an automated augmentation pipeline that synthesizes identity-preserving positive samples and retrieves hard negatives from existing video corpora, generating a diverse training dataset with four QA types. It proposes a ReLU Routing MoH attention mechanism, alongside two novel objectives: Smooth Proximity Regularization and Head Activation Enhancement. The paper presents a two-stage training strategy, transitioning from image pre-training to video fine-tuning. The model is evaluated on diverse datasets, demonstrating its superiority in personalized feature understanding.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17069/podcast.wav"}
