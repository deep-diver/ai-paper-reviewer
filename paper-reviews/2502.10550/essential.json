This makes it hard to compare different algorithms and assess their real-world applicability.  Existing benchmarks are often narrow in scope, focusing on specific problem domains rather than offering a holistic evaluation across diverse memory tasks.\nTo address this, the researchers introduce MIKASA, a comprehensive benchmark with three main contributions: a new classification framework for memory-intensive tasks; MIKASA-Base, a unified benchmark for systematic evaluation; and MIKASA-Robo, a novel benchmark focusing on robotic manipulation.  This allows researchers to evaluate memory mechanisms across different scenarios in a standardized way. The experiments show the effectiveness of the benchmark in identifying memory limitations in current algorithms and suggests new ways to improve memory-enhanced RL agents.", "affiliation": "AIRI", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.10550/podcast.wav"}
