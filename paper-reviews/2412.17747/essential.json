However, current approaches generate intermediate reasoning steps sequentially, resulting in high latency and optimization difficulties.  This research explores improving LLMs by enabling them to \"think more\" efficiently.  The limitations of existing methods involving discrete, just-in-time generation of intermediate steps, hinder efficient end-to-end training and scalability. \nThis paper proposes a novel approach. **It uses a frozen LLM augmented with an offline coprocessor that operates on the model's key-value cache.** This coprocessor generates latent embeddings which improve subsequent decoding.  The entire framework is end-to-end differentiable, enabling efficient training without reinforcement learning. Experiments show that this cache augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance on various reasoning tasks, even without task-specific training. **The asynchronous nature of this coprocessor makes it feasible for strategic computation banking,** allowing the model to refine its internal memory independently of composing a response.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.17747/podcast.wav"}
