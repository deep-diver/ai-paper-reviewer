This is because they depend on simplified temporal patterns and lack explicit temporal augmentation during training, making them prone to overfitting. Unlike images, videos need models to understand dynamic transitions, but current spatial augmentation methods don't address the temporal dimension. As a result, models show temporal inconsistency and rely on similar temporal patterns, limiting diversity. \n\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces **FLUXFLOW**, a data augmentation strategy that injects controlled temporal perturbations during video generation training. Inspired by how humans infer missing frames, FLUXFLOW disrupts fixed temporal orders to force the model to learn motion dynamics. It operates at two levels: shuffling individual frames and reordering contiguous frame blocks. **Experiments show that FLUXFLOW significantly improves temporal coherence and diversity across various video generation models**, while preserving spatial fidelity.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15417/podcast.wav"}
