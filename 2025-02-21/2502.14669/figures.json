It is a small grid-based maze with a clear start (origin) and end (target) point.  The walls of the maze are visually depicted, and the maze is designed to illustrate the tokenized representation used by the model to understand the maze's structure.", "section": "III.

It showcases the model's ability to break down the maze-solving problem into a sequence of decisions, each informed by the current state of the maze and the model's previous moves. The visualization highlights the chain of thought process and how the model dynamically updates its strategy based on what it \"sees\" and \"thinks\". This provides a clear understanding of the model's decision-making process compared to the simple 'direct prediction' baseline which tries to predict the whole solution at once.", "section": "III.
