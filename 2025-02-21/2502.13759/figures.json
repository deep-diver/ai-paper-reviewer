Two players simultaneously view the same image and attempt to guess its location. The game awards points based on the accuracy of each player's guess, with higher scores given to those who pinpoint the location more precisely. This competitive element motivates users to carefully analyze the image for visual cues such as geographical features, landmarks, architectural styles, signage, and natural elements that can help determine the correct location.", "section": "3 Data Overview"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13759/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2.

Panel (a) presents a world map visualizing the density of these locations, revealing a clear spatial heterogeneity. Dense clusters are observed in highly urbanized regions of Europe and Asia, while significantly sparser coverage is noted in areas such as Africa and Siberia. Panel (b) provides a pie chart showing the proportional distribution of geo-tagged locations across continents, with North America and Asia exhibiting the highest proportions. Finally, panel (c) uses a bar chart to compare the dataset's country-level distribution with that of a previous dataset (OSV-5M). This comparison highlights a key difference: OSV-5M is heavily skewed, with a single country accounting for 25% of its data, whereas GeoComp demonstrates a more balanced representation across countries.", "section": "Data Overview"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.13759/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3.

Traditional methods, such as retrieval-based and classification-based approaches, are limited by the quality and scale of existing datasets, resulting in coarse-grained predictions. In contrast, the authors' generation and reasoning-based method leverages a new large-scale dataset and a chain-of-thought reasoning framework to achieve fine-grained, city-level predictions.
