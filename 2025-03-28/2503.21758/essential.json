Existing models lack dedicated captioning systems tailored for T2I, resulting in inaccurate text-image pairs, constraining text and visual representation expressiveness. Thus, this impairs faithful instruction following and high-quality image generation.\n\nThe paper introduces **Lumina-Image 2.0**, a unified and efficient T2I generative framework. It uses a Unified Next-DiT model that generates images aligned with text input, and a Unified Captioner (UniCap) producing high-quality text-image pairs. The model employs efficient training and inference strategies. Unified Next-DiT utilizes a joint self-attention mechanism. UniCap generates comprehensive multilingual descriptions, enhancing model capacity and performance.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21758/podcast.wav"}
