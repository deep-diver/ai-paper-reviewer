To address this, the paper introduces **Feature4X**, a framework to extend any functionality from a 2D vision model into the 4D realm, using only monocular video input and adaptable, model-conditioned 4D feature field distillation.The core of the framework involves a dynamic optimization strategy that unifies multiple model capabilities into a single representation. \n\n**Feature4X** enhances dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting with a unified latent feature capable of distilling diverse 2D foundation features for flexibility and efficiency, representing the dense 4D feature field using a sparse set of base features. The method is fully differentiable and uses ground truth color, feature maps from 2D vision models, and an LLM-powered agentic AI to interpret natural language prompts and dynamically adjust parameters for intelligent 4D scene interaction.", "affiliation": "UCLA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20776/podcast.wav"}
