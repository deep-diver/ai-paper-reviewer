[{"heading_title": "Faithfulness Eval", "details": {"summary": "Evaluating faithfulness in video generation is crucial, moving beyond superficial metrics to assess how well generated content aligns with real-world principles. **This requires benchmarks that can automatically assess physical laws, commonsense reasoning, anatomical correctness, and compositional integrity.** Addressing this requires integrating generalist models like VLMs and LLMs with specialized anomaly detection methods. Manual assessment is still indispensable for checking physical state change ability like the mechanical thermal and material transition. It is hard to ensure 3D consistency with the absence of 3D truth data. For human-related dimensions, it is critical to determine the anomalies. Instance preservation is needed for keeping the object in generated video"}}, {"heading_title": "VBench-2.0 Suite", "details": {"summary": "The VBench-2.0 suite marks a significant advancement in video generation evaluation. Shifting from superficial metrics like aesthetics, it delves into **intrinsic faithfulness**. This includes human fidelity, controllability, creativity, physics, and commonsense. The suite's strength lies in its fine-grained assessment, breaking down each dimension into sub-abilities evaluated via diverse methods. **Leveraging both generalist VLMs/LLMs and specialist detectors** ensures robust results. A key aspect is the human preference alignment, validating automated evaluations. VBench-2.0's structured approach addresses the limitations of previous benchmarks, fostering more realistic and reliable video generation progress."}}, {"heading_title": "Prompt Refinement", "details": {"summary": "**Prompt refinement** emerges as a crucial element in modern video generation, showcasing how rewriting or augmenting text prompts significantly impacts video quality. The trade-off between **controllability** and **creativity** is highlighted, where models like Sora excel in creative tasks but struggle with precise control, and vice versa. The use of prompt refiners reveals that even without inherent understanding, a well-crafted prompt can guide models towards physically plausible outcomes. Prompt refinement is more than a preprocessing tool; it's critical for realistic simulation, and future refiners should balance precision with diversity to create open-ended content.  Furthermore, the prompt refinement seems to have no or little impact on some dimensions, likely due to limitations in model comprehension or data quality.
