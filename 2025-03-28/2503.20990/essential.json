Financial evaluation suites exist for LLMs in NLP tasks, but there's a gap: no audio-focused financial LLM or benchmark. Multimodal financial LLMs can't handle audio data yet. General AudioLLMs have progressed, enabling tasks like ASR, but a financial audio benchmark is missing, limiting research community's ability to evaluate and improve strategies.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces **FINAUDIO, the first AudioLLM benchmark for finance**. It defines three tasks: ASR for short/long financial audio, and summarization of long audio. Four open-source datasets were collected, and a new dataset for financial audio summarization was created. Seven AudioLLMs were evaluated, revealing limitations and insights for improvement. The benchmark offers a low-cost, privacy-preserving ASR solution.", "affiliation": "Stevens Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Speech Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20990/podcast.wav"}
