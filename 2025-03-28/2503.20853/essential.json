These methods process tokens sequentially, which can be inefficient. This work explores discrete diffusion models as a unified generative formulation in the joint text and image domain to address these limitations. \n\nThis paper introduces UniDisc, a Unified Multimodal Discrete Diffusion model capable of jointly understanding and generating text and images. UniDisc offers advantages over AR models, including improved control over quality versus diversity, joint multimodal inpainting, and greater controllability through guidance. Experiments demonstrate that UniDisc outperforms AR models in performance, compute efficiency, and controllability.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20853/podcast.wav"}
