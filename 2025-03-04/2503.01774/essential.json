However, generating photorealistic renderings from novel viewpoints remains challenging due to persistent artifacts, especially in under-constrained regions. Existing methods struggle with issues like spurious geometry, missing regions, and inconsistencies, which limit their applicability in real-world settings. Large 2D generative models could help, but integrating them efficiently into 3D reconstruction pipelines is still an open problem.\n\nDIFIX3D+ addresses these issues with a novel pipeline that uses single-step diffusion models to enhance 3D reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. The core of this approach is DIFIX, a single-step image diffusion model trained to enhance and remove artifacts in rendered novel views. DIFIX acts as a neural enhancer during both the reconstruction phase and at inference time, improving overall 3D representation quality and effectively removing residual artifacts. By progressively refining the 3D representation and using a fast single-step diffusion model, DIFIX3D+ achieves significant improvements in visual quality and 3D consistency.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.01774/podcast.wav"}
