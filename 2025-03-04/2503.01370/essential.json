Current methods are either time-consuming or heavily dependent on these datasets, hindering their applicability. There's a growing interest in leveraging the power of 2D diffusion models, which have shown remarkable success, to improve 3D generation, but effectively translating these 2D priors into complete 3D representations remains a key challenge. \n\nKiss3DGen tackles this challenge by **repurposing a pre-trained 2D image diffusion model** for 3D asset generation. It introduces a '3D Bundle Image,' combining multi-view images and corresponding normal maps. The model fine-tunes a diffusion model to generate these bundle images, which are then used to reconstruct complete 3D models. This approach efficiently transforms the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task. Experiments show it can generate high-quality 3D models efficiently.", "affiliation": "HKUST(GZ)", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.01370/podcast.wav"}
