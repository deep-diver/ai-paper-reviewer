It offers new insights for building end-to-end recommendation systems and preference learning, inspiring future work to explore generative models for various real-world applications and user experience enhancements.", "summary": "OneRec: A unified generative model that replaces the traditional retrieve-and-rank strategy, significantly improving recommendation quality in real-world scenarios.", "takeaways": ["OneRec, a unified generative model, outperforms traditional recommender systems by directly generating candidate videos.", "Session-wise generation and iterative preference alignment enhance the quality and coherence of recommendations.", "Deployment of OneRec in a large-scale platform demonstrates substantial improvements in user engagement, achieving a 1.6% increase in watch time."], "tldr": "Traditional recommendation systems use a multi-stage approach: retrieving potential items then ranking them. Generative retrieval-based recommendation systems (GRs) directly generate items, but haven't matched the accuracy of multi-stage systems. This paper tackles the challenge of creating a single model that can handle item recommendations effectively. \n\nThe paper introduces **OneRec**, an end-to-end generative framework. **OneRec** replaces the traditional cascaded learning with a unified generative model, which includes an encoder-decoder structure and an iterative preference alignment module. The method surpasses current complex recommendation systems, showing a substantial improvement in a real-world short video platform.", "affiliation": "KuaiShou Inc.", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Recommender Systems"}, "podcast_path": "2502.18965/podcast.wav"}
