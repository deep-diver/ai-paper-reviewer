Existing pruning methods often apply a uniform sparsity pattern across all tasks, potentially overlooking task-dependent knowledge representations. To solve these issues, this paper presents the intruiging parallel of cognitive neuroscience and conventional pruning approaches. Different tasks rely on distinct sets of neurons working collaboratively, a dynamic, task-aware strategy is needed for LLMs.\n\nThis paper introduces **Sparse Expert Activation Pruning (SEAP)**, a training-free pruning method that selectively retains task-relevant parameters to reduce inference overhead. SEAP identifies task-specific expert activation patterns and prunes the model while preserving task performance and enhancing computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SEAP significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining competitive accuracy. SEAP surpasses both WandA and FLAP by over 20% at 50% pruning and only incurs a 2.2% performance drop compared to the dense model at 20% pruning.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.07605/podcast.wav"}
