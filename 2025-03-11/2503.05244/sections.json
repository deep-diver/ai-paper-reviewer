[{"heading_title": "LLM Writ'g Gaps", "details": {"summary": "LLMs show promise in writing, but **challenges remain in evaluation**. Current benchmarks often focus on generic text or have limited writing tasks, failing to capture the **diversity and complexity of high-quality written content**. Existing metrics are inadequate for assessing creativity, logical reasoning, and stylistic precision required for generative writing. A need for **query-dependent evaluation** that can capture the nuances of specific tasks, styles, formats and lengths is required. Static metrics also lack the **robustness** and multi dimensional nature needed for writing, it's important to improve in areas of integration with material and depth."}}, {"heading_title": "Query-Dep Eval", "details": {"summary": "A query-dependent evaluation framework dynamically assesses generative writing, addressing the limitations of static criteria. It uses **LLMs to generate instance-specific evaluation criteria**, considering style, format, and material usage, fostering nuanced assessments. This is in contrast to traditional metrics. A **critic model** scores responses against generated criteria, enhancing evaluation accuracy and human alignment. This adaptability allows it to evaluate tasks, and helps identify areas where AI models can improve in various writing dimensions."}}, {"heading_title": "Data-centric SFT", "details": {"summary": "While not explicitly mentioned, a 'Data-centric SFT' approach would emphasize the **crucial role of data quality and relevance** in supervised fine-tuning (SFT). This means prioritizing **data curation**, potentially involving techniques like **filtering, augmentation, or re-weighting** to improve model performance. It would likely involve **rigorous data analysis** to identify biases, gaps, and areas where the model struggles. The goal is to **optimize the training data** to maximize the learning efficiency and effectiveness of SFT, leading to improved generation quality, style consistency, and adherence to specific requirements, ultimately resulting in better writing capabilites."}}, {"heading_title": "CoT Benifits", "details": {"summary": "**Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting significantly **enhances creative content generation** in LLMs. Models leveraging CoT outperform their non-CoT counterparts, showing its impact. This is seen from improvement in **knowledge distillation** experiments using DeepSeek-R1. Evaluating across benchmarks that CoT's capacity in storytelling. These findings points out the fact that it is important for LLMs to incorporate CoT when dealing with creative tasks. Models with CoT consistently surpass those without, highlighting CoT reasoning can empower language models."}}, {"heading_title": "Long Output Lag", "details": {"summary": "**Writing quality tends to remain stable within a certain generation length**, while length is the determining factor for overall output quality. Most models have limitations in response generation, and generally produce outputs that are approximately constrained to 3,000 tokens, so output quality tends to be stable below this range. However, there are smaller models that suffer more severe performance degradation when the constraint reaches a certain threshold, with the performance degradation characterized by repetitive outputs. **LongWriter and Qwen-Max both show effective support for extended response lengths** due to optimization in long-form generation, which shows the importance of improvement capabilities."}}]
