Current evaluation methods primarily focus on image realism and basic text alignment, failing to assess how well these models integrate and apply knowledge. This limits their potential in real-world scenarios where deeper comprehension is necessary.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces **WISE**, a new benchmark for **World Knowledge-Informed Semantic Evaluation**. WISE uses meticulously crafted prompts across diverse domains like natural science and cultural common sense to challenge models beyond simple word-pixel mapping. The paper also presents **WiScore**, a novel metric that assesses knowledge-image alignment. Experiments on 20 models reveal significant limitations in their ability to apply world knowledge, even in unified multimodal models.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.07265/podcast.wav"}
