{"importance": "This paper is important because **it introduces a novel framework, GameFactory, for creating new games using generative interactive videos.**  This addresses the crucial challenge of scene generalization in game video generation, a significant limitation of existing methods. The research also introduces a new dataset and techniques for controllable and autoregressive video generation, paving the way for more realistic and engaging AI-driven games. Its open-domain generalizability extends beyond gaming to other fields like robotics and autonomous driving.", "summary": "GameFactory uses AI to generate entirely new games within diverse, open-domain scenes by learning action controls from a small dataset and transferring them to pre-trained video models.", "takeaways": ["GameFactory enables the creation of entirely new games within open-domain scenes, addressing the limitations of existing game-specific approaches.", "The framework uses a multi-phase training strategy to decouple game style learning from action control, enhancing generalization and achieving action controllability.", "GameFactory supports autoregressive action-controllable game video generation, enabling the production of unlimited-length interactive game videos."], "tldr": "Current methods for generating game videos struggle with scene generalization, limiting their application to existing games with fixed styles and scenes. Existing video-based game generation methods often fail to address the critical challenge of scene generalization, hindering their applicability. This research introduces GameFactory, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained video diffusion models and a multi-phase training strategy to overcome this limitation. \nGameFactory addresses the scene generalization challenge by decoupling game style learning from action control. This allows the model to learn action control from a small-scale game dataset and transfer this ability to open-domain videos, enabling the creation of new games in diverse and dynamic environments. It also introduces GF-Minecraft, a high-quality action-annotated video dataset and extends its framework to enable autoregressive action-controllable game video generation, resulting in unlimited-length interactive game videos. The proposed approach demonstrates the effectiveness of the framework in producing diverse and controllable game videos, pushing the boundaries of AI-driven game generation.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08325/podcast.wav"}
