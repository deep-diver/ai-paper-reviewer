The paper suggests an autonomous generalist scientist (AGS) combining agentic AI and embodied robotics to automate research.  This could dynamically interact with physical/virtual environments and integrate knowledge across disciplines, spanning literature review, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and writing. The goal is to reduce time and resources needed for scientific discovery. \n\nThe paper introduces a framework for categorizing AGS into distinct levels of automation, from no AI to pioneer. The adaptability of robots to extreme environments, coupled with knowledge accumulation, could break through physical and knowledge boundaries. The proposed platform AIXIV functions as a public forum where research outputs can be submitted across scientific domains. This review involves human and AI or robot reviewers, leveraging strengths to assess submissions, ultimately accelerating the pace of scientific discovery.", "affiliation": "University of Toronto", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2503.22444/podcast.wav"}
