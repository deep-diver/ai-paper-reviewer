{"importance": "This paper introduces a **new method for enhancing the interpretability** and control of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). By improving the monosemanticity of VLMs, this research **opens doors for more reliable and steerable AI systems**, paving the way for further advancements in multimodal understanding and generation.", "summary": "SAEs enhance monosemanticity in Vision-Language Models, enabling interpretable control without modifying the underlying model.", "takeaways": ["Sparse Autoencoders can significantly enhance the monosemanticity of neurons in Vision-Language Models.", "Applying SAEs to intervene on a CLIP vision encoder allows direct steering of multimodal LLM outputs.", "The proposed Monosemanticity Score (MS) provides a quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of SAEs in vision tasks."], "tldr": "**Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, are powerful but lack understanding of inner workings. **Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs)**, can discover concepts efficiently. Existing VLM analysis with SAEs is limited. There is a need for better understanding for safe usage and scalable control.\n\nThis paper trains SAEs on VLMs, enhancing neuron monosemanticity and hierarchical representations. It introduces a **Monosemanticity Score (MS)** for vision tasks. SAE intervention on CLIP vision encoders enables steering multimodal LLMs. The work emphasizes SAE practicality for interpreting and controlling VLMs.", "affiliation": "Technical University of Munich", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.02821/podcast.wav"}
