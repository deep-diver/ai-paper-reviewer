Traditional gradient clipping techniques often fail due to fixed thresholds or heuristics, resulting in inefficient learning and frequent manual adjustments, increasing engineering complexity, compute overhead, and environmental impact during LLM pre-training.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces ZClip, an adaptive gradient clipping algorithm for LLM pre-training. ZClip dynamically adjusts the clipping threshold based on the statistical properties of gradient norms over time, leveraging z-score-based anomaly detection and exponential moving averages. Unlike prior reactive strategies, ZClip proactively adapts to training dynamics without prior assumptions. Empirical results demonstrate that ZClip effectively eliminates loss spikes, enables faster convergence, and achieves baseline performance with a smaller computational budget.
