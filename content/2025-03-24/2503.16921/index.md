### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

In the field of image generation, fine-tuning methods align models with human preferences. However, the subjective nature of preferences and minority samples in datasets pose challenges. Current methods assume uniform preference labels, neglecting the diversity of opinions. The impact of this dichotomy on diffusion models has not been explored, so this paper investigates the effect. The existence of minority samples can lead to performance decline, equivalent to 52% loss in performance gains.



To address these issues, **Adaptive-DPO is proposed, autonomously identifying and suppressing problematic minority samples.** It leverages a metric modeling intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator stability, distinguishing between majority and minority samples. An adaptive loss improves model learning while mitigating negative impacts. Experiments demonstrate that the method handles synthetic and real-world data, enabling effective training in image generation.

> üîº This figure shows two examples of image pairs from the Pick-a-Pic dataset [14]. Each row presents a pair of images generated in response to the same text prompt.  Human annotators have selected the image on the right as the preferred image in both examples. These examples highlight the subjective nature of human preferences in image generation and how those preferences can vary. The images illustrate different artistic styles and levels of image quality, highlighting the diversity of preferences present even within a seemingly simple task like image generation.

### In-depth insights


#### DPO's Weak Point
While DPO has emerged as a powerful technique for aligning diffusion models with human preferences, it's crucial to acknowledge its potential weaknesses. DPO relies heavily on the quality and uniformity of the preference datasets used for training. If these datasets contain **significant noise or biases**, the resulting model may not accurately reflect true human preferences. Furthermore, DPO's **pairwise comparison** approach can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with large datasets or complex models. It inherently assumes that preferences are consistent and transitive. In scenarios with subjective or ambiguous preferences, this assumption may not hold. DPO might struggle to capture the nuanced and multifaceted nature of human judgment and might be vulnerable to adversarial attacks. The absence of explicit mechanism that tackle the issue of minor data and noisy data are DPO's weak point. The **robustness of DPO** under various conditions warrants further investigation.

#### Adaptive Metric
Adaptive metrics are crucial for nuanced evaluations, especially when dealing with complex data or subjective assessments. These metrics dynamically adjust their sensitivity based on the context or the specific characteristics of the data being analyzed. This adaptability is particularly valuable in scenarios where a one-size-fits-all approach would fail to capture the subtleties and variations present. By incorporating elements of intra-annotator confidence and inter-annotator stability, the metric gains the ability to distinguish between reliable majority opinions and potentially erroneous or subjective minority viewpoints. Such a design **mitigates bias** and improves the overall robustness of the analysis. Furthermore, the integration of self-driven mechanisms allows the metric to operate autonomously, reducing the need for manual intervention or external calibration. By identifying and suppressing problematic samples, adaptive metrics contribute to a more accurate and representative understanding of the underlying phenomena.

#### Suppressing Noise
**Suppressing noise** in machine learning models, particularly diffusion models, is crucial for enhancing the quality and reliability of generated outputs. Noise can stem from various sources, including erroneous or subjective annotations in preference datasets. These inaccuracies can mislead the model, causing it to deviate from desired aesthetic and contextual expectations. **Effective noise suppression** techniques involve identifying and mitigating the impact of problematic data points. This can be achieved through methods like instance-specific reweighting, where noisy samples are assigned lower weights, and adaptive margins, which enhance the supervision from cleaner data. By focusing on reliable data and diminishing the influence of noise, models can achieve more consistent and higher-quality results, aligning better with human preferences and improving overall performance. The **robustness of the model** is maintained.

#### IR Metric Boost
An "IR Metric Boost" heading suggests strategies to improve Information Retrieval metrics. This involves optimizing algorithms to rank relevant results higher, which increases the metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score. Techniques might include enhancing query understanding by adding context awareness and handling ambiguity effectively. **Using techniques like pseudo relevance feedback** helps the algorithm in incorporating information retrieved from initial search results. The **IR system is iteratively refined** through methods such as re-ranking based on document understanding and feature importance. It emphasizes the **need for appropriate evaluation strategies** when changes in search results rankings occurs. All these will enhance the utility and trustworthiness of the system.

#### Robust to Noise
The concept of being 'Robust to Noise' is critical in machine learning, especially when dealing with real-world data. Noise, in this context, refers to any irrelevant or misleading information that can negatively impact model performance. A model that is robust to noise can effectively filter out or disregard these extraneous elements, leading to more accurate and reliable predictions. **Techniques for achieving noise robustness** often involve data preprocessing steps like outlier removal or smoothing, as well as the use of algorithms that are inherently less sensitive to noisy inputs. **Regularization methods** like L1 or L2 regularization can also help by preventing the model from overfitting to the noise present in the training data. Furthermore, **ensemble methods**, such as bagging or boosting, can improve robustness by combining predictions from multiple models, each trained on a slightly different subset of the data, effectively averaging out the impact of noise. A key challenge is to balance robustness with sensitivity to genuine signals, ensuring that the model doesn't inadvertently ignore important patterns while filtering out noise.

The x-axis represents the percentage of labels flipped (the flip ratio), and the y-axis shows the resulting proportion of minority samples. As the flip ratio increases, the proportion of minority samples increases accordingly, demonstrating a clear relationship between the amount of label flipping and the imbalance introduced into the dataset.
