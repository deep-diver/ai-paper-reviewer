The key challenges are the efficiency and controllability of video generative models which leads to substantial computational costs during inference, making real-time interactions with the model a major challenge. Also, the diverse nature of control signals leads to difficulties in controllability. \n\nTo address these issues, **MineWorld** is proposed, a real-time, open-source interactive world model in Minecraft. It employs visual-action Transformers & parallel decoding. This model learns correlations between states and actions by tokenizing both. The framework addresses efficiency and controllability, offering new assessment metrics and shows strong performance.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.08388/podcast.wav"}
