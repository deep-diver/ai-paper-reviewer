While language models have seen success with smaller models, video generation models still lag in efficient scaling. This paper addresses the challenge of training video generation models under resource constraints, where design choices are critical. Current models demand a massive GPU cost, impeding innovation. \n\nThis research introduces a cost-efficient strategy for training a video generation model, Seaweed-7B, which uses a mid-sized architecture (7B parameters) and limited GPU hours. **This model matches or surpasses the performance of much larger models**, demonstrating strong generalization. Key innovations include the VAE designs for reconstruction quality and lessons for DiT training and cost-effective strategies. The model is highly competitive and applicable to downstream tasks.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.08685/podcast.wav"}
