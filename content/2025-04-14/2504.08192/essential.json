Prevailing gradient-based methods face high costs, hyperparameter instability, poor sequential unlearning, and low interpretability. Sparse Autoencoders (**SAEs**) improve these aspects via targeted activation-based unlearning, but prior approaches underperform. This research significantly improves unlearning dynamically.\n\nThis paper introduces Dynamic SAE Guardrails (**DSG**), a method for precision unlearning using SAEs. **DSG** integrates Fisher Information-based feature selection with a dynamic classifier. Experiments demonstrate **DSG** substantially outperforms leading unlearning methods, achieving superior forget-utility trade-offs and interpretable unlearning.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Safety"}, "podcast_path": "2504.08192/podcast.wav"}
