However, current approaches mainly focus on centralized settings where a single entity controls the model and data. The potential of RAG in collaborative learning, where multiple clients jointly train a shared model without directly exchanging their data, remains largely unexplored. This leads to missed opportunities for leveraging diverse knowledge and resources in a decentralized manner. \n\nThis paper introduces **CoRAG, a framework for collaborative RAG**, enabling multiple clients to jointly train a shared model using a collaborative passage store. To evaluate CoRAG, the paper introduces **CRAB, a new benchmark for collaborative open-domain question answering**. Experiments demonstrate that CoRAG consistently outperforms both parametric collaborative learning methods and locally trained RAG models in low-resource scenarios. The research further analyzes the impact of passage composition (relevant, irrelevant, and hard-negative passages) on model performance, providing valuable insights for designing effective collaborative RAG systems.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2504.01883/podcast.wav"}
