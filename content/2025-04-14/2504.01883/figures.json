CoRAG consistently outperforms Flan-T5 across training configurations. Performance gap between CoRAG and baselines widens as training samples per client decreases.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of three different models on the CRAB benchmark: Flan-T5 (a strong parametric model), RAG (Local) which uses only local data, and CoRAG (the proposed collaborative model).  The x-axis shows the number of training examples per client (16, 32, or 64), representing different few-shot learning settings. The y-axis displays the Exact Match score, a metric evaluating the accuracy of the models' question answering. The bars illustrate that CoRAG consistently achieves better performance than Flan-T5 across all training data sizes.  Furthermore, the advantage of CoRAG over the baselines becomes more significant when fewer training examples are available per client.", "section": "3.3 CoRAG is Effective in Few-shot Settings"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.01883/extracted/6331296/figures/incentives-final.png", "caption": "Figure 2: 64-shot EM scores on the CRAB benchmark. L is Local and CL is Collaborative. CoRAG consistently improves over RAG (Local) across all clients (1-8) and store choices. Improvement varies depending on the composition of passage store.", "description": "This figure displays the performance of CoRAG (Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and RAG (Local) models on the CRAB (Collaborative RAG Benchmark) dataset using 64 training examples per client.  The x-axis represents the eight clients in the experiment. The y-axis shows the Exact Match (EM) scores, a common metric for evaluating question-answering models.  Different colored bars represent different passage store compositions (REL: relevant passages; IRR: irrelevant passages; REL-1: one client has relevant passages; SPLIT: client-specific relevant passages). The results indicate that CoRAG consistently outperforms RAG (Local) across all clients regardless of passage store configuration. However, the magnitude of improvement varies depending on the composition of the shared passage store, demonstrating the effect of data composition on CoRAG performance.
