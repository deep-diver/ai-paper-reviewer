{"importance": "This paper introduces a plug-and-play framework **FlexIP**, offering unprecedented control over image generation. This research advances personalized image creation, balancing identity and creativity, enabling new possibilities for digital art, design, and content creation. This opens avenues for exploring AI's role in customized visual content.", "summary": "FlexIP: Controllable image generation, balancing preservation and personalization.", "takeaways": ["FlexIP decouples identity preservation and personalized editing, allowing independent control.", "Dynamic weight gating enables continuous adjustment between preservation and personalization.", "The dual-adapter architecture enhances edit fidelity and eliminates feature competition."], "tldr": "Existing image generation methods struggle to balance preserving subject identity with enabling diverse edits. They often treat these goals as conflicting, forcing trade-offs. Current zero-shot methods use alignment modules which are insufficient for capturing complex visual knowledge, leading to issues with identity preservation. This results in the inability to work harmoniously between identity preservation and editorial fidelity. \n\nTo solve this, this paper introduces **FlexIP**, a framework with two components: a Personalization Adapter for stylistic manipulation and a Preservation Adapter for identity maintenance. Explicitly injecting both controls, FlexIP enables flexible control through dynamic weight tuning. The system is a dual-adapter architecture enabling each adapter to focus clearly on its specific task to improve complementary strengths and maximize efficiency.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.07405/podcast.wav"}
