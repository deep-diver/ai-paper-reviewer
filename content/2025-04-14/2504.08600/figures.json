Previous work on NL2SQL primarily relies on supervised fine-tuning to enable the model to learn how to generate SQL. However, in the case of complex database schema or ambiguous semantics, the fine-tuned model may struggle to produce SQL that does not align with the user\u2019s intentions, as it depends on a fixed generation strategy and previous data. By introducing reinforcement learning algorithms, the model can receive intuitive feedback from the database during the training process. This feedback encourages the model to independently explore various SQL generation reasoning approaches, ultimately enhancing the accuracy of its output.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core idea of the SQL-R1 model.  Traditional NL2SQL methods use supervised fine-tuning, where the model learns to generate SQL queries from examples. However, this approach struggles with complex database schemas or ambiguous natural language, resulting in inaccurate SQL.  The SQL-R1 model uses reinforcement learning, allowing it to receive direct feedback from the database during training. This feedback improves the model's ability to reason and generate accurate SQL queries even in complex situations, by exploring different SQL generation approaches and refining its output based on the database's response.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08600/extracted/6354434/Figures/visualization_modelsize.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance and model scale on the BIRD-Dev dataset.", "description": "This figure shows the relationship between the model size (in billions of parameters) and the execution accuracy of various models on the BIRD-Dev dataset.  It compares the performance of several different language models, including those specifically designed for NL2SQL tasks, general-purpose reasoning models, and larger language models, highlighting the trade-off between model size and accuracy.", "section": "3.2 Main Results"}]
