Recent techniques use vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, which offer multi-modal representations via zero-shot learning. But, these methods often freeze or only partially tune pretrained weights, which isn't ideal for downstream tasks and maintaining high ID accuracy. The core issue is a modality gap within in-distribution (ID) embeddings, where images and texts are unexpectedly separated in representation space, thus, limiting how well they can leverage the textual knowledge.\n\nTo address this, this paper introduces Cross-Modal Alignment (CMA), which fine-tunes image and text encoders to improve both OoDD performance and ID accuracy. CMA enhances cross-modal alignment by regularizing the distances between image and text embeddings of ID data. This method aligns similar semantics from different modalities (text and image) more closely in the hyperspherical representation space. Experiment results show that CMA achieves SOTA performance on multiple benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18817/podcast.wav"}
