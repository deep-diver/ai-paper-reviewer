By automating the detection of systematic errors, this research **opens new avenues for improving VLM robustness and trustworthiness** in open-world settings, with potential implications for downstream tasks relying on these models.", "summary": "DASH: Detect systematic VLM hallucinations in open-world settings with our automated pipeline, improving model reliability via optimized image retrieval & fine-tuning.", "takeaways": ["DASH, a novel pipeline, effectively detects systematic object hallucinations in VLMs by identifying clusters of semantically similar images that trigger these errors.", "DASH-OPT, an image-based retrieval component, optimizes image generation to uncover model-specific hallucinations, outperforming text-based methods.", "Fine-tuning VLMs with DASH-generated data mitigates object hallucinations and enhances performance on related tasks."], "tldr": "Vision-language models(VLMs) often make mistakes by \u201cseeing\u201d objects that aren't there. Current tests for these errors don't fully capture how these models are used in real-world, open settings, or catch systematic errors. This paper addresses the limitations of current methods that rely on small, labeled datasets and are insufficient for assessing hallucinations in open-world scenarios and detecting systematic errors.\n\nTo fix these issues, the authors introduce an automated process, called DASH, to spot these errors, focusing on scenarios where the model incorrectly says \u201cyes\u201d to seeing an object. DASH uses optimized image retrieval to find misleading images and groups similar images where the VLM hallucinates. The results showed DASH can find many error clusters and that fixing the model with DASH data helps reduce these hallucinations.", "affiliation": "T\u00fcbingen AI Center \u2013 University of T\u00fcbingen", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "2503.23573/podcast.wav"}
