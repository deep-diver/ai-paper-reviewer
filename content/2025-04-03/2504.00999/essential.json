Improving one aspect often negatively impacts others, indicating a lack of consistency in VQ-based learning frameworks. This paper argues that visual generation and representation, while seemingly conflicting, have intrinsic complementarity if information loss is minimized with specific designs, paving way for unified latent space.\n\nTo address the mentioned issues, the paper introduces **MergeVQ, a new framework that incorporates token merging techniques into VQ-based autoregressive generative models.** During pre-training, MergeVQ decouples top-k semantics from the latent space and recovers fine-grained details through cross-attention in the decoder for reconstruction. The method also introduces MergeAR, which performs KV Cache compression for efficient raster-order prediction in the second-stage generation. Experiments verify MergeVQ's effectiveness in achieving competitive results in both representation learning and generation, while maintaining token efficiency and inference speed.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.00999/podcast.wav"}
