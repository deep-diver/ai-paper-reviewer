{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it presents a new approach to **human image animation** that tackles the limitations of existing methods. By offering **holistic control, multi-scale adaptability, and long-term temporal coherence**, this research opens new avenues for creating more realistic and expressive animations. Also, this research provides valuable insights into how hybrid guidance and progressive training can be leveraged to improve the quality and robustness of image animation techniques.", "summary": "DreamActor-M1: Holistic, Expressive and Robust Human Image Animation with Hybrid Guidance", "takeaways": ["DreamActor-M1 enables fine-grained holistic control, multi-scale adaptability and long-term temporal coherence in human image animation.", "The framework uses hybrid control signals including implicit face latent, explicit 3D head spheres and 3D body skeletons for robust motion control.", "The approach utilizes complementary appearance guidance for consistent video generation over long durations."], "tldr": "Existing image-based human animation methods have limitations in fine-grained holistic control, multi-scale adaptability, and long-term temporal coherence. This leads to reduced expressiveness and robustness. To overcome these issues, the paper introduces a new diffusion transformer framework. It aims to produce expressive and identity-preserving animations while handling various body poses and image scales. Methods also often fail to maintain temporal coherence. \n\nThe proposed framework uses hybrid guidance for motion control. It integrates implicit facial representations, 3D head spheres, and 3D body skeletons. It employs a progressive training strategy using data with varying resolutions and scales for scale adaptation. This strategy handles various body poses and image scales. Appearance guidance is integrated from sequential frames with visual references to ensure long-term coherence.", "affiliation": "Bytedance Intelligent Creation", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.01724/podcast.wav"}
