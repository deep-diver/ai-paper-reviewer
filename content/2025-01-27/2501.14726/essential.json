Previous methods often lacked either high fidelity or the ability to relight the avatars in real-time, limiting their applications. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a novel approach, 'Relightable Full-Body Gaussian Codec Avatars'.\nThis approach uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for efficient geometry representation.  It leverages **learned radiance transfer** functions, employing **zonal harmonics** for diffuse light and **deferred shading** for specular light to accurately capture complex light interactions.  The key innovation lies in efficiently handling the rotation of light transport functions, ensuring realism for various body poses and lighting conditions.  The results demonstrate the superior quality and efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.", "affiliation": "ETH Zurich", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.14726/podcast.wav"}
