However, this caching creates a vulnerability: cached prompts are processed faster than new ones, potentially revealing sensitive information about users through timing attacks. This is especially risky if the cache is shared across all users (global caching). The paper focuses on auditing real-world LLM APIs to detect prompt caching. \nThe researchers developed and employed a statistical audit method that leverages timing differences between cached and non-cached prompts to detect caching and identify the levels of cache sharing. The study reveals that global cache sharing was present in many APIs, raising major privacy concerns and leading to significant security risks.  The study also uncovered that timing variations due to prompt caching can leak information about the LLM's architecture, a previously unknown vulnerability.  The responsible disclosure of this critical information prompted several API providers to take actions to mitigate these privacy risks.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.07776/podcast.wav"}
