Existing methods, including reward models and automated verification, often fall short.  This limits the progress towards building truly autonomous AI systems that can iteratively refine their outputs. \nThe paper proposes CTRL (Critic Training via Reinforcement Learning), a novel framework that addresses these challenges. CTRL trains a specialized critic model to generate feedback that guides the generator model towards better solutions.  This is achieved through a two-stage process combining supervised fine-tuning with reinforcement learning.  The results show significant performance gains across various code generation benchmarks and illustrate the method\u2019s effectiveness in test-time scaling via iterative critique-revision.  This decoupled approach demonstrates strong generalization capabilities and offers a promising path towards building more robust self-improving AI systems.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.03492/podcast.wav"}
