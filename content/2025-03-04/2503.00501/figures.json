Xiaohongshu leverages a two-column result list for S&R services, retrieving heterogeneous results like image-text, video, and commercial notes.

There are also various modules to stimulate users to search for any topics they might be interested in.", "description": "The figure shows Xiaohongshu's search results page, which uses a two-column layout.  The results are diverse, including image-text posts, videos, and commercial listings. A key feature is the inclusion of a Deep Query Answering (DQA) module that offers direct answers to user queries, in addition to the standard list of results.  Also shown are various modules designed to suggest new topics and encourage further searches from users.", "section": "1 INTRODUCTION"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.00501/x1.png", "caption": "Figure 2. The data construction process of Qilin. The front-end log is joined with sampled user IDs to obtain the dataset backbone.

It begins with sampling user IDs from Xiaohongshu's database.  These IDs are then linked to the platform's frontend logs to build the dataset's foundation. Next, features are extracted from different databases: request details, user profiles, and note attributes (including image and text information).  A crucial step is the filtering process, employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and manual expert review to eliminate unsafe or inappropriate content, resulting in a clean, high-quality multimodal dataset.", "section": "3 THE QILIN DATASET"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.00501/x2.png", "caption": "(a) Position bias.", "description": "This figure shows the click-through rate (CTR) for search and recommendation results across different ranking positions.  It illustrates the well-known \"position bias,\" where higher-ranked results tend to receive more clicks. The figure also shows that the decay in CTR with ranking position is slower for recommendations than for search results. This difference is likely due to different user browsing behaviors in these two scenarios.", "section": "4.2 Engagement & result distribution"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.00501/x3.png", "caption": "(b) Session bias.", "description": "This figure shows the click-through rate (CTR) for search and recommendation results across multiple sessions.  It demonstrates that CTR decreases as the session progresses, indicating a session bias effect.
