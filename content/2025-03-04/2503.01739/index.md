### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-video models fall short of user expectations because they aren't trained on relevant topics. Existing video datasets often lack alignment with real-world user interests. To address this, the paper introduces the **VideoUFO dataset**, which is specifically curated to focus on user preferences. It also features minimal overlap with existing datasets and uses Creative Commons licensed videos. 



 The paper identifies 1,291 user-focused topics, retrieves related YouTube videos, segments them into clips, generates captions, and verifies content. Experiments show that current models struggle with certain topics. A model trained on VideoUFO outperforms others in these areas, demonstrating the dataset's value in enhancing text-to-video generation quality.

> üîº The figure shows a comparison between a firefly image generated by the Sora text-to-video model and a real-world firefly image.  The generated firefly appears noticeably different from the real one, highlighting the limitations of current text-to-video models when dealing with topics (like glowing fireflies) not adequately represented in their training data.  The model struggles to accurately represent the visual characteristics of the firefly, suggesting a need for datasets with broader topic coverage.

### In-depth insights


#### User-Focused Data
User-focused data in text-to-video generation emphasizes the need for datasets that reflect real-world user interests, addressing a key gap where current models often fall short of expectations. **By curating data based on user-generated prompts, specifically leveraging platforms like YouTube with Creative Commons licenses, a user-focused approach aims to improve the alignment between generated content and actual user needs**. The significance lies in creating a training dataset that prioritizes topics and aesthetics relevant to users, leading to more satisfying and applicable video outputs. Minimal overlap with existing datasets becomes crucial, ensuring that models trained on user-focused data gain new knowledge rather than simply reprocessing old information. Moreover, compliance with data usage regulations, achieved through Creative Commons licensing, ensures greater flexibility and accessibility for researchers.

#### VideoUFO vs Others
When comparing VideoUFO to other video datasets, several key distinctions emerge. **VideoUFO is curated with a specific focus on aligning with real user interests in text-to-video generation**, setting it apart from datasets gathered from open-domain sources that may lack this user-centric approach. Additionally, VideoUFO introduces **novel data** obtained directly from YouTube, contrasting with datasets that primarily reprocess existing data. Moreover, VideoUFO **prioritizes data compliance** by exclusively using videos with Creative Commons licenses, offering researchers greater freedom in utilizing the data, an element often overlooked in other recent datasets. This strategic focus on user needs, new data, and compliance differentiates VideoUFO, making it a valuable resource for advancing text-to-video models that truly cater to user expectations.

#### BenchUFO Design
**BenchUFO design likely focuses on creating a benchmark for text-to-video models.** It will probably involve selecting diverse prompts, generating videos using these prompts, and evaluating the quality of the generated videos. **Key considerations would include the choice of evaluation metrics** to accurately measure the alignment between the text prompt and the generated video content, **diversity of prompts** and **prompt sources** to fairly evaluate generalizability, the choice of the text-to-video generation model, and the resources required for the analysis.** The goal is to analyze effectiveness to generate videos that contain user-focused topics.

#### Topic Coverage Gap
Analyzing the topic coverage gap reveals a critical disparity between existing video datasets and the actual focus of users in text-to-video generation. **Current datasets, often sourced from broad, open-domain content, fail to adequately represent the specific topics users actively seek when creating videos.** This misalignment results in text-to-video models that underperform in real-world scenarios because they are not trained on relevant data. The paper emphasizes the need for datasets curated with a user-centric approach to bridge this gap, ensuring models are exposed to a wider variety of niche interests and emerging trends. This gap highlights a need in more diverse training data to cover real user interests to improve model performance on realistic topics. **VideoUFO is designed specifically to close this gap by collecting videos according to real users' preferences and generating appropriate captions.**

#### Towards Realism
The push **towards realism** in text-to-video generation is a crucial step in bridging the gap between current model outputs and user expectations. The paper highlights Sora's shortcomings in accurately depicting real-world phenomena like glowing fireflies, indicating a need for more realistic training data. A dataset curated to align with 'users' focus,' as opposed to generic open-domain datasets, directly addresses this. **Realism** extends beyond visual fidelity; it encompasses contextual accuracy and capturing intricate details specific to user intents. Improving **realism** inherently enhances the applicability of generated videos across diverse sectors like film, gaming, education, and advertising, ultimately leading to more satisfying and useful creative outcomes. The paper's exploration of user preferences is pivotal for moving away from creating impressive yet often disconnected content towards more meaningful and relatable video generation.
