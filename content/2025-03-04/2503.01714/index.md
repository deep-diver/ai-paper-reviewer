### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Humans easily read scrambled words, a phenomenon called Typoglycemia, by leveraging word form and contextual cues. While LLMs can do the same, it's unclear how. This paper investigates **how LLMs internally process** scrambled text, focusing on the roles of word form and context. They conduct controlled experiments using LLaMA models, introducing a metric called SemRecScore to measure semantic reconstruction. 



The study reveals that **LLMs primarily depend on word form**, using specialized attention heads, with context playing a minimal role. This contrasts with human readers who adaptively balance word form and context. These findings suggest that improving LLMs' context awareness could lead to more human-like semantic understanding. The authors anticipate that the future research direction would be a broader range of model architectures and languages.

> üîº This figure illustrates the correlation between the increase in scrambling ratio (ŒîSR) and the average negative correlation rate (NegCorrRate) across various LLaMA models.  The x-axis represents the change in scrambling ratio (ŒîSR), indicating the extent of character scrambling within words. The y-axis shows the average NegCorrRate, a metric reflecting the consistency of the model's completion probability across different scrambling levels. The graph reveals a strong positive correlation: as the scrambling ratio increases, the NegCorrRate also increases. This demonstrates that SemRecScore (a metric used to quantify semantic reconstruction) is reliably associated with completion probability consistency and is a valid measure for semantic reconstruction. The different colored lines represent the results for different sized LLAMA models, indicating the trend holds across a range of model sizes.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Typoglycemia
**LLMs demonstrate resilience to scrambled words (Typoglycemia), but their mechanisms differ from humans.** While humans adaptively balance word form and context, LLMs primarily rely on word form. LLMs possess **specialized attention heads** for processing word form, exhibiting a structured approach regardless of context. Further research could explore methods that can enhance LLM ability to incorporate human-like, context-aware mechanisms, which results in enhanced LLM performance.

#### SemRecScore Metric
The study introduces a novel metric called SemRecScore to quantify the degree of semantic reconstruction in LLMs when processing scrambled words, a phenomenon known as Typoglycemia. **This metric is crucial for understanding how LLMs internally handle and recover meaning from perturbed word forms**. SemRecScore calculates the cosine similarity between the representation of the original word's token and the representation of the final subword token of the scrambled word at each layer of the LLM. **This layer-wise comparison allows for tracking the progressive recovery of word meaning across the network's depth**. The choice of cosine similarity is likely motivated by its ability to capture semantic relatedness in a vector space, where closer vectors indicate greater similarity. Furthermore, by focusing on the final subword token of the scrambled word, the metric aims to capture the most integrated semantic representation after the LLM has processed the fragmented input. **The metric's effectiveness is validated using Negative Correlation Rate**, showing a link between the metric's scores and the models' ability to generate relevant completion.

#### Form vs. Context
The interplay between form and context is a central theme in understanding language processing, whether by humans or machines. **Word form**, encompassing the visual or orthographic properties of a word, often serves as the initial access point for meaning. If the word form is degraded or unfamiliar, such as in cases of scrambled letters (**typoglycemia**), the reader relies more heavily on **contextual information** to infer the intended meaning. This context can include surrounding words, sentence structure, and broader discourse knowledge. In essence, there exists a dynamic interaction where the relative importance of form and context shifts based on the clarity and completeness of the available cues. While **humans adaptively balance these two sources** to maintain efficient comprehension even with noisy or incomplete input, large language models(LLMs) tend to rely on word form, but **context is negligible for LLMs**.

#### Attention Analysis
Analyzing attention mechanisms offers a lens into how LLMs process information, particularly concerning word form and context. By dissecting attention weights, we can discern which parts of the input the model deems most relevant for semantic reconstruction. **Attention heads specialized in processing word form** might emerge, revealing a structured approach to leveraging form information. Understanding how attention shifts with varying degrees of scrambling and contextual integrity could uncover whether LLMs adaptively adjust their focus, or rely on fixed patterns. **Comparing LLM attention strategies with human reading behavior** may highlight key differences in how each handles scrambled words. This knowledge could inform methods to enhance LLM performance by incorporating more human-like context-aware mechanisms. 

#### Fixed Attention
**Fixed attention** mechanisms, in the context of neural networks and particularly transformers, refer to attention patterns that remain relatively stable regardless of input variations. This contrasts with **adaptive attention**, where attention weights dynamically adjust based on the specific relationships within the input data. A fixed attention might imply a pre-defined allocation of focus, potentially simplifying computation but also limiting the model's ability to capture nuanced dependencies. This could arise from inherent architectural constraints, training biases, or a deliberate design choice to prioritize efficiency over maximal expressiveness. This could reveal insights into the inductive biases present within the model architecture or the training data. Understanding the conditions under which attention remains fixed, and the consequences for model performance, is crucial for both interpreting and improving these models.

> üîº Figure 2 visualizes the performance of semantic reconstruction by LLMs (1B, 3B, and 70B parameter models) under varying levels of word scrambling (Scramble Ratio, SR) and contextual information (Context Integrity, CI). The top row displays the SemRecScore (a metric quantifying semantic reconstruction) across different SR levels for each model, holding CI constant at its highest value (CI=1).  The bottom row shows the impact of varying CI levels on SemRecScore, while keeping SR constant (SR=0.25 and SR=1). This figure demonstrates that across all three models and varying CI conditions, word form is the primary driver of successful semantic reconstruction in the face of scrambled letters, with context playing a minimal role.

> üîº This figure displays the average AttentionSelf across all samples at each layer for different Scramble Ratios (SR) and model sizes.  It shows how much attention the final token of a scrambled word gives to all other tokens in the same word, across different layers of the LLM.  Subplots (a), (b), and (c) show the results for 1B, 3B, and 70B parameter models, respectively, all with complete contextual information (CI=1). Subplot (d) shows results for the 3B parameter model with no contextual information (CI=0). The key observation is that as the SR increases (meaning more scrambling), the AttentionSelf consistently increases across all layers and model sizes.  Furthermore, a cyclic pattern in attention allocation is observed across layers. Critically, the similar cyclic pattern even in the absence of context (subplot (d)) indicates that LLMs focus on word form independently of context.

Higher SR values consistently elicit stronger attention to word form, and the cyclic attention pattern remains unchanged even without context, suggesting that LLMs process word form independently of contextual information.

> üîº This figure visualizes how attention is allocated to word forms within the LLaMA-1B-Instruct language model under varying degrees of word scrambling (Scramble Ratio or SR).  Each heatmap represents a different SR level (0, 0.5, and 1, indicating no scrambling, moderate scrambling, and extreme scrambling, respectively). The x-axis shows the different attention heads in the model, and the y-axis represents the layers of the model's architecture. The color intensity of each cell in the heatmap indicates the strength of attention paid to the word form by a specific attention head at a particular layer. Brighter colors signify stronger attention. The figure demonstrates that certain attention heads consistently focus on word form regardless of the SR level, but a higher SR activates more of these specialized attention heads. This suggests a structured and stable mechanism within the model for processing word-form information, even when the words are significantly scrambled.

The scores are shown for two levels of context integrity (CI): 0 and 0.25. Each plot shows how well the model reconstructs the meaning of a scrambled word across the different layers of the model.  The consistent performance across different levels of CI, regardless of scrambling level, demonstrates that the amount of surrounding context has minimal effect on the model's ability to reconstruct the meaning of a scrambled word.

Two rows show results for different levels of context integrity (CI): the top row for CI=0.25 and the bottom for CI=0.75.  Across different levels of scrambling, the consistency of SemRecScore curves for various CI levels suggests that the amount of context has very little effect on the models' ability to reconstruct the meaning of scrambled words.

> üîº Figure 8 displays the results of an experiment evaluating the impact of word form and context on semantic reconstruction using three different sizes of the LLaMA language model.  The experiment manipulated the Scramble Ratio (SR), representing the degree of letter scrambling within words, and Context Integrity (CI), indicating the amount of surrounding context.  The figure plots the Semantic Reconstruction Score (SemRecScore) across different layers of each model.  The top row shows results with a Scramble Ratio of 0.75, while the bottom row presents results when the context is complete (CI=1).  The close similarity of lines within each row (different CI levels) demonstrates the minor effect of context on semantic reconstruction.  The noticeably lower SemRecScores in the higher SR rows highlight the crucial role of word form in the model's ability to reconstruct the meaning of scrambled words.
