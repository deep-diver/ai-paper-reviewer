Existing systems lack adaptability and real-time environmental awareness, hindering their robustness in real-world scenarios. To tackle this, current integrations still face limits in feedback quality and struggle with continuous adaptation and deployment complexities.\n\nThis paper introduces **CLEA, a novel architecture using four specialized LLMs for closed-loop task management**. It features an interactive task planner for dynamic subtask generation and a multimodal execution critic for assessing action feasibility. **CLEA enhances robustness in object search and manipulation tasks, outperforming baselines with significant improvements in success and completion rates**.", "affiliation": "Shenzhen Future Network of Intelligence Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2503.00729/podcast.wav"}
