A final verification step ensures high-quality labeled patches for training.", "description": "The figure illustrates the multi-step process of creating the SPIDER dataset. It begins with raw whole-slide images (WSIs) that are manually annotated by expert pathologists to identify regions of interest representing different tissue morphologies.  These annotated WSIs then undergo patch extraction, where the images are divided into smaller, 224x224 pixel patches. Feature embedding is performed on these patches using the Hibou-L model. Then, a similarity-based retrieval method is used to identify additional visually similar patches from other WSIs, expanding the dataset size. Finally, all identified patches undergo a binary verification step by pathologists to guarantee high-quality labels, ensuring the patches are ready for model training. This entire process creates the high-quality dataset for the SPIDER project.", "section": "3 Dataset"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.02876/extracted/6252553/plots/classifier.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Model architecture overview: The classifier processes a central patch alongside surrounding context patches. Features are extracted using the Hibou-L model, and an attention-based classification head integrates context information to improve central patch classification.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the model used for patch-level classification in the SPIDER dataset.  The model takes as input a large patch (1120x1120 pixels) composed of a central patch and 24 surrounding context patches.  Each of these 25 smaller (224x224 pixels) patches is processed individually by the Hibou-L feature extractor. The resulting embeddings from all 25 patches are then concatenated and fed into a transformer-based classification head. This head utilizes an attention mechanism to weigh the importance of the central patch and its surrounding context patches.  Finally, the classifier outputs probabilities for each class, which represent the likelihood of the central patch belonging to each class.  The use of context patches is a key feature, designed to improve the accuracy of the central patch classification by providing additional spatial information.", "section": "4 Model"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.02876/extracted/6252553/plots/patches_per_class_skin.png", "caption": "Figure A1: Dataset skin class distribution", "description": "This bar chart visualizes the distribution of different skin tissue classes within the SPIDER dataset.
