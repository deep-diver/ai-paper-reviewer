{"importance": "This study is crucial for **understanding and mitigating the impact of LLMs on information ecosystems**. It underscores the **need for careful monitoring** of content quality and reliability in the face of AI-driven content generation, offering insights for future research and policy.", "summary": "LLMs modestly affect Wikipedia, subtly altering content and potentially skewing NLP benchmarks.", "takeaways": ["LLMs have a limited but measurable impact on Wikipedia content, with certain categories more affected than others.", "Machine translation benchmarks based on Wikipedia content may be skewed by LLM influence, affecting comparative model results.", "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems may be less effective with LLM-generated content due to potential 'pollution' of the knowledge base."], "tldr": "Large Language Models(LLMs) raise concerns about Wikipedia's future. While Wikipedia hasn't remained unaffected, the impact of LLMs requires comprehensive investigation. Current research has started examining the influence of LLMs on Wikipedia, this paper analyzes the direct impact of LLMs on Wikipedia, focusing on changes in page views, word frequency, and linguistic style, exploring indirect effects on NLP, particularly in machine translation and RAG.\n\nThis paper quantifies the impact of LLMs on Wikipedia pages across categories and analyzes this impact from the perspective of word usage, providing estimates. It examines how LLM-generated content affects machine translation and the efficiency of RAG. Results show a slight decline in page views, and some Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs, with an overall limited impact. Machine translation scores may be inflated. RAG may be less effective with LLM content.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.02879/podcast.wav"}
