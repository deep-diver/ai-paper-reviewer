### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Subject-consistent video generation, creating videos that match a reference image while following textual prompts, is a challenging problem. Current methods struggle with either creativity (text-to-video) or control (image-to-video). This paper introduces PHANTOM, a new approach that leverages a combined text-image prompt input and a redesigned model to balance creativity and subject consistency. 



PHANTOM uses a novel data pipeline with image-text-video triplets to train the model. It achieves improved subject consistency by carefully choosing reference images and focusing on the subject's appearance and actions. The results show that PHANTOM outperforms existing methods, particularly in preserving the subject's identity and following textual instructions effectively, paving the way for advanced video generation applications.

> üîº This table compares the performance of different video generation methods across two key aspects: identity consistency and prompt following.  Identity consistency measures how well the generated videos maintain the identity of subjects from the input reference image (e.g., a specific person's face).  Prompt following assesses how accurately the generated videos reflect the textual instructions given as prompts.  The results help to understand the strengths and weaknesses of various approaches in subject-consistent video generation.

### In-depth insights


#### Cross-Modal Alignment
Cross-modal alignment in video generation aims to **harmoniously integrate textual and visual information**, creating videos that accurately reflect both the textual descriptions and the visual content of reference images.  This is crucial because text provides semantic meaning and intent, while images offer specific visual details and subject matter.  **Effective alignment requires a model architecture that can effectively fuse these modalities**, learning complex relationships between words, concepts, and visual features.  The challenge lies in **handling the inherent differences in the nature of text and images**, their varied levels of abstraction, and the need to ensure consistent generation across different prompts.  **Successful cross-modal alignment enables control over the video generation process**, allowing users to specify both the subject matter and the desired actions, leading to subject-consistent video generation.  The core of this alignment often relies on **multimodal training data comprising text-image-video triplets**, allowing models to learn direct mappings between these modalities.  Finally, the **evaluation of cross-modal alignment necessitates a comprehensive metric that considers both the visual fidelity and the semantic consistency** of the generated video relative to the input prompts, capturing both the text-video and image-video alignment.

#### S2V Data Pipeline
A robust Subject-to-Video (S2V) data pipeline is crucial for effective model training.  It necessitates a **triplet data structure** comprising text, image, and video, carefully aligning these modalities.  The pipeline should **differentiate between in-paired and cross-paired data**.  In-paired data, using keyframes from the target video, simplifies training but risks over-reliance on visual similarity and neglect of textual instructions. Cross-paired data, employing images from different videos, encourages the model to synthesize video based on textual descriptions, enhancing generalization.  **Careful filtering and preprocessing** are essential to mitigate visual redundancy, ensure data quality and consistency, and address potential biases.  The selection of image prompts must consider various application scenarios like single vs. multi-subject generation and human-object interactions.  Thorough annotation of videos focusing on subject description rather than generic captioning is critical for effective cross-modal alignment.  Finally, a well-designed S2V pipeline needs to **balance the diversity and controllability** of text and image inputs for better subject consistency in video generation.

#### Phantom Framework
The Phantom framework, as described, is a unified video generation model built upon existing text-to-video and image-to-video architectures.  Its core innovation lies in its **cross-modal alignment** strategy, achieved through a redesigned joint text-image injection model trained on text-image-video triplet data. This allows for the simultaneous and deep alignment of textual instructions and visual references, enhancing subject consistency.  The framework emphasizes **subject consistency** in video generation, surpassing the limitations of previous ID-preserving models, by using a data pipeline that carefully selects and categorizes image-text-video triplets to avoid simple copy-pasting from images to video. It incorporates components like a vision encoder and a text encoder that provide high-level semantic information, thereby compensating for potential limitations of basic encoders. The architecture's modular design, using established pre-trained models, suggests an efficient and scalable approach to achieving high-quality subject-consistent video generation.

#### Evaluation Metrics
To effectively evaluate subject-consistent video generation, a multifaceted approach to evaluation metrics is crucial.  **Video quality** should be assessed using established metrics like resolution, visual clarity, and aesthetic appeal. However, these are insufficient.  **Text-video consistency** needs careful measurement, perhaps using cosine similarity between video captions and input text prompts.  Crucially, the core objective of subject consistency requires dedicated metrics. This could involve comparing generated video features to reference image features using perceptual similarity measures or by employing facial recognition technology for identity preservation tasks.  **Quantitative metrics** should be supplemented by **qualitative analysis**, including human evaluation of generated videos' realism and adherence to textual instructions, to provide a comprehensive assessment.

#### Future of S2V
The future of Subject-to-Video (S2V) generation hinges on several key advancements. **Improved cross-modal alignment** is crucial, enabling more seamless integration of text and image prompts for precise control over video content.  **Enhanced data efficiency** is vital to reduce the large datasets currently needed to train robust models, facilitating broader accessibility and application.  **Development of more sophisticated architectures** capable of handling complex scenes and interactions will allow for more realistic and detailed video generation.  **Addressing ethical concerns** regarding the potential misuse of such technology for creating deepfakes or spreading misinformation is paramount; robust detection and verification techniques are required. Finally, **exploring real-time or near real-time S2V capabilities** would significantly broaden the scope of applications, including interactive storytelling and virtual reality experiences.  The integration of these factors will shape the next generation of S2V, unlocking new creative and practical possibilities.
