Easy examples are processed by the smaller model for efficiency; hard examples, which the smaller model struggles with, are handled by the more accurate, but computationally expensive, larger model.

The x-axis represents latency relative to the smaller model, and the y-axis represents the safety F1 score.  The plot shows that SafeRoute achieves a significantly better balance between lower latency and higher F1 score compared to using either model alone.
