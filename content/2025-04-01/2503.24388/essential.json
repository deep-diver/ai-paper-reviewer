Previous methods either incorporate one of these abilities or combine specialized models, which limits learning efficiency and generalization. To address this, this paper introduces **RIG, an end-to-end generalist policy that synergizes reasoning and imagination**. \n\nTo enable end-to-end training, the authors developed a data pipeline that integrates imagination and reasoning into trajectories collected from existing agents. **RIG learns the correlation between reasoning, action, and environment dynamics**, generating actions, simulating outcomes, and reviewing them before execution. This approach achieved significantly improved sample efficiency and generalization compared to previous works.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2503.24388/podcast.wav"}
