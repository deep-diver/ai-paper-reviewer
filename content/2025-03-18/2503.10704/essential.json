{"importance": "This paper provides a theoretical foundation and error analysis for ARVDMs, offering insights into memory bottlenecks and error accumulation that will help the community develop more efficient and effective models for long-form video generation. Also, the proposed Meta-ARVDM framework will help researchers analyze other ARVDMs. By addressing the limitations of existing models, this work paves the way for generating high-quality, coherent videos with reduced computational cost and improved temporal consistency, advancing the state-of-the-art in video synthesis.", "summary": "Unified framework reveals and mitigates error sources in autoregressive video diffusion models.", "takeaways": ["Meta-ARVDM framework unifies and analyzes ARVDMs.", "Identified memory bottleneck and error accumulation in ARVDMs.", "Network structures mitigate the memory bottleneck."], "tldr": "Auto-Regressive Video Diffusion Models (ARVDM) have shown promise in generating realistic videos, yet lack theoretical analysis. This work introduces **Meta-ARVDM**, a framework for analyzing ARVDMs. It uncovers two key issues: **error accumulation** (errors increase over time) and a **memory bottleneck** (models struggle to retain past information). Error accumulation refers to the fact that the later generated frames usually have poorer equality than the previous. By deriving an information-theoretic impossibility result, it shows that the memory bottleneck phenomenon cannot be avoided. \n\nTo address the memory bottleneck, the paper designs network structures to explicitly utilize more past frames, improving the performance. These structures leverage prepending and channel concatenation. The trade-off between mitigating the bottleneck and inference efficiency is improved by compressing frames. Experiments validate these methods and demonstrate a Pareto-frontier between error accumulation and the memory bottleneck across different methods.
