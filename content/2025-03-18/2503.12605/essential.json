{"importance": "This survey on MCOT is essential for researchers, **consolidating knowledge and spurring innovation** by pinpointing existing challenges and future research directions. The provided resources support further advancements in multimodal AGI.", "summary": "A comprehensive survey of multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) reasoning, bridging the gap in existing literature and fostering innovation towards multimodal AGI.", "takeaways": ["Presents the first systematic survey of MCoT reasoning, defining key concepts and taxonomies.", "Analyzes current MCoT methodologies across various modalities and application scenarios.", "Offers insights into existing challenges and future research directions to foster innovation in multimodal AGI."], "tldr": "Multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) reasoning enhances AI by extending chain-of-thought reasoning to multimodal contexts, integrating modalities like image, video, and audio. This approach has gained traction in applications like robotics, healthcare and autonomous driving. Current MCOT studies design innovative reasoning paradigms to address the unique challenges of each modality, and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are playing an increasingly significant role. \n\nTo address the lack of a unified resource, this survey offers a systematic overview of MCOT reasoning, defining key concepts and providing a taxonomy of methodologies from various perspectives, such as rationale construction, structural reasoning and objective granularity. It highlights applications, datasets, and benchmarks, also exploring the future directions and existing challenges in the field of MCOT. A key resource, it aims to foster innovation toward achieving multimodal AGI.", "affiliation": "NUS", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.12605/podcast.wav"}
