### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing 4D reconstruction methods are limited by their inability to handle wide-range spatial movements and the lack of suitable datasets for evaluation. Current benchmarks mainly focus on actions performed in place within limited scenarios, highlighting the need for datasets that include more complex spatial dynamics. Additionally, existing methods struggle with deformation fields for dynamics estimation, resulting in poor quality when dealing with wide-range movements.



This paper introduces **WideRange4D**, a novel 4D reconstruction benchmark designed to address these limitations. It features rich 4D scene data with large spatial variations, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of 4D generation methods. The paper also presents **Progress4D**, a new 4D reconstruction method that divides the generation process into high-quality 3D scene reconstruction and progressive fitting of 4D dynamics, achieving stable and high-quality results in complex scenes.

### In-depth insights


#### Spatial 4D needs
While 'Spatial 4D needs' isn't explicitly addressed, several implicit needs arise from the paper. Primarily, there's a need for **datasets that capture wide-range spatial movements**, moving beyond in-place actions. Existing datasets limit the evaluation of 4D reconstruction methods in complex scenarios. Therefore, the main need is to create **high-quality 4D scene reconstruction** and maintaining **stability**, especially in complex 4D scenes. Overcoming deformation field limitations and wide-range variations is the fundamental need. Further, advanced algorithms for generating stable and rational 4D scenes that integrate with current SOTA methods is a practical need.

#### Progress4D: SOTA
While the provided text doesn't explicitly have a "Progress4D: SOTA" heading, the content strongly suggests Progress4D achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. **The paper introduces Progress4D as a novel method for 4D reconstruction, specifically designed to overcome limitations of existing methods in handling wide-range movements and complex scenes.** Experimental results on the newly proposed WideRange4D benchmark demonstrate that **Progress4D outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D reconstruction methods.** This claim is supported by both quantitative metrics (L1, PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) and qualitative comparisons. **The method's success is attributed to its two-stage approach: high-quality 3D scene initialization followed by progressive fitting of 4D dynamics.** Ablation studies further validate the importance of key components, such as the timestep alignment loss, in achieving stable and high-quality results. Therefore, based on the presented evidence, Progress4D is positioned as a significant advancement in 4D reconstruction and demonstrates SOTA performance.

#### New: WideRange4D
The introduction of 'WideRange4D' marks a significant advancement in 4D reconstruction. **Existing datasets often lack the complexity of real-world scenarios, particularly in capturing wide-range spatial movements.** 'WideRange4D' directly addresses this limitation by providing a benchmark with diverse scenes and dynamic object motions. **This new dataset enables a more comprehensive evaluation of 4D reconstruction methods**, pushing the boundaries beyond localized actions. By including varied environments and complex movements, 'WideRange4D' presents a more realistic and challenging testbed, ultimately fostering innovation in the field.

#### Accurate init.
The accurate initialization is important for 4D scene generation. The initialization is the first step, it greatly impacts the scene quality. **A blurred foreground object** makes it harder to achieve high-quality 4D synthesis. Hence, the object should be clean to make it easier for the next generation process. It is easier to init a high-quality 3D scene if the test cases in 4D reconstruction benchmarks involve in-place movement. **It is hard to init a high-quality 3D scene with a wide-range of movements**, the existing reconstruction methods struggle to initialize a high-quality 3D scene. The high-quality 3D reconstruction of all objects in the 4D scene should be performed in their stationary state to ensure high-quality 4D scene reconstruction.

#### Future: Flow?
Considering potential future directions in the context of 4D reconstruction, exploring the integration of flow-based methods presents a compelling avenue. **Flow-based techniques, particularly flow matching, could offer enhanced efficiency in capturing the dynamic evolution of scenes.** The explicit modeling of temporal coherence inherent in flow-based approaches might lead to more stable and accurate reconstruction, addressing current limitations in handling large displacements and complex deformations. The inherent ability of flow matching to define straight flows with velocity consistency would be beneficial. However, challenges remain. **The high dimensionality and intricate nature of 4D data necessitate careful design of the flow architecture.** Moreover, effective handling of occlusions and discontinuities in the temporal domain would be crucial for robust performance. Integrating flow matching could lead to significant advancements in 4D reconstruction.

> 🔼 This figure compares the initialization of a 4D scene using two different methods: an existing method (4DGS) and the authors' proposed method (Progress4D).  When dealing with wide-range movements of objects within a 4D scene, existing methods often produce blurred or poorly defined foreground objects in the initial 3D reconstruction. This makes it extremely difficult to generate a high-quality 4D reconstruction in later processing steps. In contrast, the new method's initialization shows clearer and more well-defined objects, even in scenes with significant movement.

> Figure 6: 4D scene initial comparison. The reason why existing methods fail to generate high-quality 4D scenes is that when a 4D scene involves wide-range variations, the initialized foreground objects become so blurred that they seem to vanish completely, making it difficult to achieve high-quality 4D synthesis in subsequent generation processes.

The second stage progressively fits the 4D dynamics using an MLP to estimate deformation fields (Δμ, ΔS, ΔR) at each timestep.  A timestep alignment process is used, calculating weights based on temporal similarity and a motion mask, to help maintain stability and accuracy, particularly in scenes with wide-range movements. The overall loss function includes color loss, total variation loss, and the timestep alignment loss.

The graph likely shows a comparison of the 4D reconstruction results with and without the Lalign component. The results would demonstrate how the inclusion of Lalign improves the quality and stability of 4D scene reconstruction, especially when dealing with complex scenes involving wide-range spatial movements.  Specifically, it likely shows that without Lalign, the quality of the reconstruction degrades over time as the movement becomes more extensive. However, with Lalign, the quality remains consistently high, even for complex movements.
