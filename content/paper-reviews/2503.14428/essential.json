Models still exhibit issues such as semantic leakage, misaligned spatial relationships, and subject missing. Existing methods involve the use of object-grounding layouts or multi-round evaluations based on language models, but still have limitations such as failure to capture the fine-grained shape variations, and high computational and training costs. \n\nTo solve this, the paper proposes a novel training-free method that enhances compositional T2V generation through dual-phase refinement. This strategy reinforces subject-specific semantics, resolves inter-subject ambiguity, and integrates grounding priors and model-adaptive spatial perception to flexibly bind subjects to their spatiotemporal regions through masked attention modulation. Experiments demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.14428/podcast.wav"}
