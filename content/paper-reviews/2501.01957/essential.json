This often leads to performance limitations and latency issues due to the need for separate automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) modules.  Furthermore, modality conflicts during training can hinder the development of truly multimodal systems. \nThis paper introduces VITA-1.5, a novel MLLM that addresses these challenges through a three-stage training approach.  It progressively introduces speech data, starting with vision-language training, followed by audio input processing, and finally, end-to-end speech generation. This approach effectively mitigates modality conflicts and allows for fluent, real-time interactions. VITA-1.5's performance on various image, video, and speech benchmarks demonstrates its strong multimodal capabilities and near real-time efficiency.", "affiliation": "Tencent Youtu Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.01957/podcast.wav"}
