They are often limited to single garment try-ons, and struggle to handle diverse inputs such as text descriptions, garment images, and human poses, restricting user control and customization. Moreover, they frequently can not maintain the fidelity of details in generated images, and are unable to support the generating of human image with consistent IDs. Existing methods also struggle to synthesize realistic and diverse images that cater to the needs of personalized fashion design. \nFashionComposer addresses these limitations by offering a flexible, multi-modal framework based on diffusion models. It accepts diverse inputs including text, parametric human models, and multiple garment images and integrates these inputs through novel attention mechanisms, such as subject-binding attention, to compose complex fashion scenes. Additionally, FashionComposer introduces correspondence-aware attention and latent code alignment to support consistent human album generation. This solution enables users to create photorealistic images, virtual try-ons with multiple garments and personalized outfits.  Extensive experiments show that this method surpasses previous techniques in terms of fidelity and customization capacity.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.14168/podcast.wav"}
