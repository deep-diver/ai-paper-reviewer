### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current virtual try-on and fashion image generation methods lack flexibility. They are often limited to single garment try-ons, and struggle to handle diverse inputs such as text descriptions, garment images, and human poses, restricting user control and customization. Moreover, they frequently can not maintain the fidelity of details in generated images, and are unable to support the generating of human image with consistent IDs. Existing methods also struggle to synthesize realistic and diverse images that cater to the needs of personalized fashion design. 

FashionComposer addresses these limitations by offering a flexible, multi-modal framework based on diffusion models. It accepts diverse inputs including text, parametric human models, and multiple garment images and integrates these inputs through novel attention mechanisms, such as subject-binding attention, to compose complex fashion scenes. Additionally, FashionComposer introduces correspondence-aware attention and latent code alignment to support consistent human album generation. This solution enables users to create photorealistic images, virtual try-ons with multiple garments and personalized outfits.  Extensive experiments show that this method surpasses previous techniques in terms of fidelity and customization capacity.

### In-depth insights


#### Compositional Power
**FashionComposer** exhibits significant **compositional power** by integrating multiple elements.  It handles diverse inputs like text, parametric human models, garment images, and faces, enabling complex scene creation. The **subject-binding attention** mechanism strengthens this power by semantically linking visual assets with text descriptions, allowing the model to discern and represent multiple garments effectively. This approach offers fine-grained control over the generated image, allowing for detailed personalization of the human figure, pose, and clothing.  Evaluations highlight its superiority over existing methods in maintaining fidelity and consistency, showcasing its potential for various applications, including virtual try-on and album generation.

#### Multi-Modal Fusion
**Multi-modal fusion** is crucial for FashionComposer's compositional capabilities. It seamlessly integrates diverse inputs like **text prompts, parametric human models (SMPL), garment images, and face images**. This fusion allows for highly flexible and personalized fashion image generation, controlling human appearance, pose, and garments in a single pass.  The framework effectively combines these modalities, allowing for complex compositions and supporting tasks like virtual try-on and human album generation.  The key is the effective integration of these diverse data types to achieve a unified and coherent representation for downstream image generation tasks.

#### Fidelity Focus
**Fidelity Focus** emphasizes generating high-quality, realistic fashion images.  This involves **preserving intricate details** of garments and faces, avoiding artifacts, and ensuring natural textures.  **Sharpness, color accuracy, and correct representation of materials** are crucial for a believable image. Achieving fidelity requires advanced techniques, like **reference UNets and subject-binding attention**, to effectively utilize reference images.  **Balancing fidelity with other factors, such as compositionality and consistent identity,** is vital for a comprehensive solution, as prioritizing only fidelity may limit flexibility or introduce artifacts. Evaluation metrics like CLIP-I, DINO, and user studies are essential to assess and refine fidelity.

#### Identity Album
**Identity Albums**, fueled by AI, could revolutionize **personalized storytelling and digital identity**. Imagine creating visual narratives showcasing **evolving styles, aging, or diverse personas**. This tech could **impact fashion**, letting users visualize outfits on themselves across time or in various styles. In **entertainment**, it could **generate characters with evolving backstories**, enriching narratives.  However, **ethical concerns arise**, especially around **misinformation and manipulation**. Ensuring **responsible development and usage** is crucial to prevent misuse and protect individuals.  Further exploration of these technologies could lead to powerful **tools for self-expression and creative exploration**.

#### Try-on Trials
**Virtual try-on** technology has revolutionized online shopping by letting users visualize how clothes would look on them.  This is typically achieved by overlaying garment images onto a picture of the user or a model.  A key challenge is maintaining **realistic appearance** while ensuring the garment **fits** the user's figure in a **plausible** way.  Advanced techniques like **3D body modeling and garment warping** help address this, yet perfecting the virtual try-on experience across different body types, poses, and garment styles remains an ongoing area of research. Newer methods are incorporating aspects like **fabric drape and texture**, moving beyond simply placing a 2D image onto a figure.  The ability to **virtually try on complete outfits**, considering layering and coordination, is also a significant advancement.

> üîº FashionComposer takes various inputs such as garment composition, optional face, text prompt, and densepose from SMPL to generate or edit fashion images.  It uses Reference UNet to extract garment/face features, which are then injected for denoising through Feature Injection Attention. The text prompt is fused with UNets via cross-attention and subject-binding attention.  Subject-binding attention associates extracted features with corresponding text descriptions (semantics) to avoid confusion and better maintain details. For example, if given a prompt 'A slim woman with short brown hair wears a green shirt and yellow skirt', it will extract features for the shirt, skirt, face, and pose and bind them to descriptions like 'green shirt' and 'yellow skirt'. It will then use these bound features together with human pose information to generate a realistic image.

Subject-binding attention links visual features of garments with corresponding text descriptions to better distinguish different items.  The table compares variations of subject-binding attention. 'Bind(1,2,3)' applies the attention mechanism to all UNet blocks, while 'Bind(1)' applies it only to the blocks with the smallest resolution. 'Conv-in' refers to another approach where text embeddings are injected through the convolution layer of the reference UNet instead. The metrics used are CLIP-I (image similarity), DINO (image similarity), CLIP-T (text-image similarity), Quality (based on a user study), and Fidelity (based on a user study).  The results suggest that applying subject-binding attention to all UNet blocks achieves the best balance between image similarity and text alignment, with higher scores in both quality and fidelity assessments from users.
