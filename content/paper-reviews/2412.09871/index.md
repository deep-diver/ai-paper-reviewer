### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current large language models (LLMs) rely on tokenization, a pre-processing step that groups bytes into tokens. While effective, tokenization has limitations, impacting model robustness, cross-lingual performance, and efficiency due to fixed compute allocation per token.  Directly using bytes avoids these issues, but processing long byte sequences is computationally expensive, especially at scale. Existing solutions using efficient attention or attention-free models have primarily helped smaller models. At scale, feed-forward layers dominate computational costs, demanding a better compute allocation strategy.  Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) addresses these challenges using dynamic, learnable patching of bytes. It allocates compute based on data complexity using entropy-based patch segmentation.  This allows for efficient compute usage and improved handling of data complexity. BLT introduces byte n-gram embeddings and a cross-attention mechanism to enhance byte-level information flow. Scaling studies show BLT matches and even outperforms token-based models like Llama 3, while offering up to 50% inference FLOP savings. It also reveals a new scaling dimension with simultaneous increases in model and patch size for a fixed inference budget.

> üîº This figure presents scaling trends of byte-level language models compared to token-based models. It demonstrates that for a fixed inference FLOP budget, BLT models with patch sizes 6 and 8 outperform BPE Llama 2 and 3 models when trained on varying training data sizes. The x-axis represents the training FLOPs, and the y-axis represents the bits-per-byte (BPB).  The lower the BPB, the better the performance of the model. As the training data size increases, BLT models achieve lower BPB than the other models. The vertical lines indicate the compute-optimal point for BPE and the crossover point where BLT starts outperforming BPE. The figure highlights that the BLT architecture enables scaling both model and patch size simultaneously for a fixed inference budget, unlike token-based models where the inference budget fixes the model size. The graph also indicates that larger patch sizes (e.g., 8) become more advantageous with larger inference budgets.

In contrast, the BLT architecture provides a new scaling axis allowing simultaneous increases in model and patch size while keeping the same training and inference budget. BLT patch-size (ps) 6 and 8 models quickly overtake scaling trends of bpe Llama¬†2 and 3. Moving to the larger inference budget makes the larger patch size 8 model more desirable sooner. Both BPE compute-optimal point and crossover point are indicated with vertical lines.

> üîº This table compares the performance of different 8B parameter language models on various benchmarks.  The models include a baseline Llama 3 model using the standard Llama 3 tokenizer, and two BLT models trained on the same number of bytes but with different patching schemes: BLT-Space (space patching) and BLT-Entropy (entropy patching).  The benchmarks measure zero-shot and few-shot performance on tasks involving common sense reasoning, world knowledge, and code generation. The table shows that BLT models can achieve better average performance than the baseline Llama 3 model while also potentially using significantly fewer FLOPS during inference.

### In-depth insights


#### Byte-Level LLMs
**Byte-Level LLMs** process text as raw bytes, avoiding tokenization. This offers advantages like **robustness to noise**, handling rare words, and better multilingual support.  However, processing long byte sequences presents computational challenges.  Some models utilize techniques like **dynamic patching** to group bytes and efficiently allocate compute resources.  This approach has shown promising results, demonstrating competitive performance with token-based models while also offering significant **inference cost reductions**.  Further research focuses on scaling laws and efficient training strategies for byte-level LLMs to unlock their full potential. This also presents advantages in several NLP tasks including machine translation of low resource languages.

#### Dynamic Patching
**Dynamic patching**, as explored in the BLT architecture, revolutionizes compute allocation in LLMs.  By dynamically grouping bytes into **variable-length patches** based on next-byte entropy, BLT focuses compute resources on complex segments, enhancing efficiency and performance. This contrasts sharply with fixed-length patching and tokenization, which allocate compute uniformly regardless of content complexity.  BLT's approach leads to **improved inference efficiency**, allowing for larger model sizes within the same compute budget.  The **entropy-based segmentation**, using a small byte-level LM to predict next-byte probabilities and define patch boundaries, dynamically adjusts compute allocation based on information density, showing substantial performance improvements over static methods.

#### BLT Architecture
The **BLT architecture** fundamentally rethinks sequence processing by using **dynamically sized patches** instead of fixed tokens.  A small byte-level local encoder first transforms byte sequences into these patches. Then, a larger, more computationally intensive latent transformer processes the patch representations.  Finally, another small byte-level decoder converts the processed patches back to bytes. This dynamic patching allows **compute allocation** based on data complexity, concentrating resources on less predictable areas, improving efficiency, and facilitating the processing of longer sequences. This approach also enhances **robustness to noise** and **understanding of sub-word aspects**, addressing common limitations of token-based LLMs.

#### Scaling & Robustness
**BLT's dynamic patching** allocates compute based on complexity, enabling efficient scaling. Unlike fixed tokenization, BLT adjusts patch size, optimizing for both **model size and inference speed.**  This allows simultaneous scaling, unlike token-based models where a fixed inference budget dictates size.  Experiments show BLT matching Llama 3 training performance with up to **50% fewer inference FLOPS.** Notably, larger patch sizes in BLT show better scaling trends, suggesting potential for even greater efficiency at larger scales.  This flexible scaling, coupled with robustness to input noise and awareness of sub-word units, positions BLT as a **promising alternative** to traditional methods.

#### Tokenizer-Free Future
A **tokenizer-free future** for Large Language Models (LLMs) offers compelling advantages.  Tokenization, a pre-processing step that segments text into discrete units, introduces limitations like vocabulary size constraints and sensitivity to noise. Eliminating this step could enhance **model robustness**, enabling better handling of noisy or unusual inputs, crucial for real-world applications.  Furthermore, a byte-level approach allows the model to learn directly from raw data, potentially uncovering **deeper character-level understanding** and improving performance on tasks like phonetic transcription or orthographic analysis. By removing the fixed vocabulary, models could also gain **adaptability to new data and languages**, reducing the need for extensive retraining.  This shift also promises improvements in **training and inference efficiency** by dynamically allocating compute resources based on data complexity. However, a tokenizer-free approach presents challenges such as efficiently handling long sequences and developing effective byte-level training strategies.  Despite these hurdles, the potential benefits warrant further exploration into this promising direction for LLM development.

> üîº The figure shows the architecture of the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT). It consists of three main modules: 1) a Local Encoder: This module takes raw bytes as input and encodes them into patch representations. It incorporates byte n-gram embeddings and cross-attention to enhance information flow. 2) a Latent Transformer: This is the core of the model and operates on the patch representations. It's computationally expensive and serves as a global context processor. 3) a Local Decoder: This lightweight module decodes the patch representations from the Latent Transformer and produces raw byte predictions. Unlike conventional tokenization-based models, BLT maintains direct access to byte-level details by dynamically grouping bytes into patches.

The x-axis represents each byte and the y-axis entropy. A red horizontal line shows the global threshold. When the entropy of a byte exceeds this threshold, a new patch is started, marked by a vertical gray line. Longer patches occur when the entropy stays low after the first byte. For example, 'George R.R. Martin' is split into multiple patches since both 'G' and 'e' have entropy above the threshold, but the next few bytes stay low and extend the 'e' patch.

> üîº The local encoder uses a cross-attention mechanism with patch representations as queries and byte representations as keys and values to transform byte representations into patch representations. Similarly, the local decoder uses a cross-attention block but reverses the roles: byte representations serve as queries while patch representations are used as keys and values.  The local encoder and decoder enable the model to transition between byte-level and patch-level representations, enhancing the model's ability to handle both granular byte-level information and higher-level patch-level abstractions. This dual-level processing empowers the model to capture intricate byte-level details while efficiently processing larger chunks of text via patches.  In this figure, a Cross-Attn parameter *k* = 2 is used.

> üîº This table presents benchmark results comparing an 8B parameter BPE Llama 3 tokenizer-based model with two 8B parameter BLT models, one with Space patching and the other with Entropy patching.  All models were trained on the Llama 2 dataset for an optimal number of training steps as determined by Dubey et al. (2024).  The metrics used for evaluation include ARC-Easy, ARC-Challenge, HellaSwag, and PIQA. The goal is to demonstrate that dynamic entropy-based patching allows the BLT model to achieve similar or better performance compared to the BPE baseline, despite the simpler patching strategy.

The model is trained on 100B bytes of text data.  The table reports the bits-per-byte (bpb) performance of these models on different datasets, including Wikipedia, Common Crawl (CC), Github, and a random sample from the training data distribution (Train Dist).  The table investigates whether applying cross-attention to all layers, the last layer, or the first layer of the encoder and decoder impacts performance.

> üîº This table presents an ablation study on the use of n-gram hash embedding tables for a 1B parameter Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) model trained on 100B bytes.  The table explores different n-gram sizes (3-8) and per-n-gram vocabulary sizes (50k, 100k, 200k, and 400k), evaluating their impact on bits-per-byte (BPB) across various datasets (Wikipedia, Common Crawl, GitHub, and a training data distribution). The results demonstrate that incorporating hash n-gram embeddings significantly improves language modeling performance by reducing BPB. The study also reveals that the vocabulary size allocated to each n-gram is a critical factor, with larger vocabulary sizes generally leading to better performance. Furthermore, smaller n-gram sizes appear to be more influential than larger ones in enhancing performance.

The study investigates the impact of varying the number of layers in the local encoder and decoder modules on the model's performance, as measured by bits-per-byte (BPB) on a held-out training data set.  The table also includes a condition where n-gram embeddings are not used. The results suggest that when hash n-gram embeddings are employed, a lightweight local encoder with fewer layers is sufficient, and more layers can be allocated to the decoder for improved performance without increasing computational cost.

> üîº This table compares the bits-per-byte (BPB) performance and perplexity of different n-gram embedding strategies in a 1 billion parameter Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) model trained on 100 billion bytes of text. It specifically ablates the use of frequency-based and hash-based n-gram embedding tables, varying parameters like n-gram sizes and vocabulary size. The table also reports perplexity across different text domains like Wikipedia, Common Crawl, Github, and the training data distribution to assess the effectiveness of these strategies. This comparison highlights the efficacy of both n-gram types in enhancing language modeling performance but showcases hash n-gram embeddings as generally more beneficial due to its ability to overcome vocabulary limitations. Further analyses demonstrate that smaller n-gram sizes often yield better performance gains.
