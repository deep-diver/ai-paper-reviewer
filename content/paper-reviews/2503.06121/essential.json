While researchers have explored various architectures like Transformers, LSTMs, and GRUs, the unique characteristics of time series data and the computational demands of model scaling necessitate new solutions. Current methods often struggle with heightened computational demands and potential accuracy losses when processing data. \n\nThe paper introduces Rimer, a novel solution using **RWKV-7**, which incorporates meta-learning. By integrating RWKV-7's time mix and channel mix into Timer (a transformer-based time series model), Rimer achieves substantial performance improvements and reduces training time with fewer parameters. Benchmarks reveal that Rimer matches or outperforms Timer across metrics, offering a lightweight solution for scaling time series models.", "affiliation": "Not Available", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.06121/podcast.wav"}
