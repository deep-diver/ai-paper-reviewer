Each category is further divided into several variables that determine the degree of access.  For example, Resourcing considers factors like the cost and availability of computing infrastructure needed to use the system. Technical Usability examines the ease of use for different user groups, including the required technical skills and interface quality. Finally, Utility assesses the usefulness and value of the system for various purposes, such as multilingual support and output quality. The figure helps to clarify the different aspects of accessibility beyond simply whether a system is released, highlighting the tradeoffs involved in different choices.", "section": "4 Breaking Down Access"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16701/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Flow of Access and Scale with High Level Tradeoffs", "description": "This figure illustrates the progression from an AI system's initial availability to its eventual widespread accessibility, highlighting key trade-offs at each stage. It starts with the \"Available\" stage, where system components are simply released. This then transitions to the \"Accessible\" stage, emphasizing the three primary dimensions influencing accessibility: resourcing (infrastructure needs), technical usability (required technical skills), and utility (practical benefits for users). Finally, the figure depicts the \"Scaled Access\" stage, which considers the impact of increasing access and reach on the system, including individualized access (for specific researchers), distribution (methods of making the system available to a broader audience), and manageability (ability to identify and mitigate harm). The figure emphasizes how the expansion of access generates both positive outcomes (wider reach and benefits) and negative ones (increased risk and costs).", "section": "5 Scaling Access: Access to Whom"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.16701/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 4: Shifting from Available to Accessible with High Level Tradeoffs", "description": "This figure illustrates the transition of an AI system from a state of mere availability to one of genuine accessibility, highlighting the key factors involved.  The left side shows the \"Available System,\" signifying that the system's components (model weights, code, data, etc.) exist and are released.  The central section focuses on the three axes of \"Accessibility\": Resourcing (the infrastructural requirements for hosting and using the system), Technical Usability (the level of technical expertise needed to use the system), and Utility (the practical applications and usefulness of the system).  The right side shows the \"Accessible System,\" representing the stage where the system components are not only released but also practically usable by a wider range of users. The arrows and annotations illustrate the high-level tradeoffs between the benefits (e.g., broader access, more applications) and the risks (e.g., increased potential for misuse, higher costs) at each stage of the process.
