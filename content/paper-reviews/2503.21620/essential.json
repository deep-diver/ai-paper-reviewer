This paper uses rule-based RL to improve how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) understand graphic user interfaces (GUIs) to predict actions. The authors created a small, high-quality dataset of 136 tricky tasks with five common action types on mobile. They also made a unified rule-based action reward to optimize models using policy-based algorithms.\n\nThe authors introduce **UI-R1-3B**, a data-efficient model that significantly improves both in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain (OOD) tasks. The action type accuracy increases by 15% on the ID benchmark ANDROIDCONTROL, and grounding accuracy goes up by 10.3%, compared to the base model (Qwen2.5-VL-3B). On the OOD GUI grounding benchmark ScreenSpot-Pro, the model outperforms the base model by 6.0%.", "affiliation": "vivo AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21620/podcast.wav"}
