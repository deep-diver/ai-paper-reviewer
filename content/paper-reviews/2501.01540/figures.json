The BoxingGym\u00a0Framework is designed to holistically evaluate experimental design and model discovery capabilities in the spirit of George Box [6]. 1) The process starts with a user defining a goal for the scientist agent. 2) The scientist formulates a theory. 3) This theory guides the experimental design, where the scientist interacts with a simulated world to gather new data. 4) The scientist then analyzes the new and old data to propose and refine theories. This iterative process continues for several iterations. 5) The scientist is then asked to explain the findings to a novice. 6) We evaluate the novice and the scientist by casting the goal as a prediction problem.", "description": "BoxingGym is a framework designed to evaluate AI agents' capabilities in experimental design and model discovery.  The figure shows the iterative process: 1) a user defines a goal; 2) the AI agent (scientist) formulates a theory; 3) the theory guides experiments in a simulated world, yielding new data; 4) the scientist analyzes data (new and old) to refine the theory; 5) the scientist explains the findings to a novice agent; 6) both agents' performance is evaluated based on how well they achieve the initial goal (cast as a prediction problem).", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.01540/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Python pseudocode examples.

The left panel shows the class structure for defining environments (WorldEnv), goals (Goal), and agents (Agent). The classes encapsulate functions for building models, resetting states, taking steps in the environment, defining goals, evaluating goal achievement, calculating information gain, setting goals, acting in the environment, making predictions, and providing explanations. The center panel provides a pseudocode algorithm that details the workflow of BoxingGym. This involves an iterative process of goal setting, proposing a theory, designing experiments, collecting data, analyzing and refining the theory, explaining the results to a novice, and evaluating goal achievement.  The right panel presents an example of the hyperbolic temporal discounting environment illustrating how an agent would interact with it and subsequently explain the obtained results to a novice.", "section": "3 Boxing Gym"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.01540/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Standardized errors compared.
