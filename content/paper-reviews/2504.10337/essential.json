High-quality verification data is scarce, impeding progress in challenging problems. The verification ability of LLMs has not been sufficiently investigated, so verifying solutions remains a difficult task.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces **Heimdall**, a long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification LLM, trained via reinforcement learning to accurately judge solution correctness. **Pessimistic Verification**, a novel method, extends Heimdall's functionality to scale up problem solving, selecting the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. The results show Heimdall significantly improves verification accuracy and problem-solving performance, even generalizing to unseen problem types.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2504.10337/podcast.wav"}
