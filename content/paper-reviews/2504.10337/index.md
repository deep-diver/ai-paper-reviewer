### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current AI excels at complex reasoning, but struggles with verification. High-quality verification data is scarce, impeding progress in challenging problems. The verification ability of LLMs has not been sufficiently investigated, so verifying solutions remains a difficult task.



To address these issues, this paper introduces **Heimdall**, a long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification LLM, trained via reinforcement learning to accurately judge solution correctness. **Pessimistic Verification**, a novel method, extends Heimdall's functionality to scale up problem solving, selecting the most likely correct solution with the least uncertainty. The results show Heimdall significantly improves verification accuracy and problem-solving performance, even generalizing to unseen problem types.

> 🔼 Figure 1 demonstrates Heimdall's scalability in verification accuracy.  The left panel shows that longer reasoning sequences during reinforcement learning (RL) training lead to more accurate assessments of solution correctness on the AIME2024 dataset. The middle panel illustrates that repeated sampling and majority voting further enhance accuracy. The right panel showcases how Heimdall, when integrated with a solver model using Pessimistic Verification, improves problem-solving accuracy on the AIME2025 dataset by selecting the most likely correct solution from multiple candidates (each verified 16 times). The improvement is particularly noteworthy when compared to using Majority Voting alone.

> Figure 1: Scaling of Heimdall. Left: the verification accuracy scales with the response length during RL training. With more reasoning tokens, Heimdall gives more accurate judgment on the solutions on AIME2024. Middle: the verification accuracy scales with repeated sampling and Majority Voting. By sampling multiple verification trajectories and voting, the accuracy can be further improved. Right: with Heimdall scoring the solutions on AIME2025, the problem solving accuracy scales with the number of solutions. We verify 16161616 times on each solution and select the most likely correct one with Pessimistic Verification(×16absent16\times 16× 16). When inter-playing with various solver models, Heimdall gives significant improvements over pure solver-based Majority Voting(MV).

### In-depth insights


#### CoT Verification
While the provided document doesn't explicitly have a section titled "CoT Verification," we can infer its meaning from the context. It likely refers to the process of **verifying the correctness of Chain-of-Thought reasoning** performed by large language models (LLMs). This verification is critical because while CoT enhances problem-solving, the reasoning steps can still contain errors. A "CoT Verification" module would ideally **analyze each step in the CoT process**, identifying logical flaws, incorrect calculations, or unsupported assumptions. It would need to be able to generalize, detecting errors even in CoT processes it hasn't seen before. Furthermore, it should be robust, avoiding false positives that undermine trust in the LLM's solutions. The paper proposes a "Heimdall" model and method called "Pessimistic Verification" to address this challenge. The ability to accurately verify CoT reasoning is crucial for building reliable and trustworthy AI systems.

#### Pessimistic LLM
**Pessimistic LLMs represent a fascinating area of research**, potentially offering improved robustness and reliability in decision-making. The 'pessimism' likely entails prioritizing caution, rigorously scrutinizing inputs, and assigning higher costs to potential errors. **One key advantage is its potential mitigation of overconfidence**, a common issue in LLMs leading to inaccurate outputs. By design, such models are less prone to making bold, unsupported claims. **They would likely prioritize solutions with the least uncertainty**, enhancing dependability in high-stakes scenarios. Further research could explore how to balance pessimism with efficiency, to avoid excessive computational costs.

#### RL Data Filter
Based on the provided research paper, the concept of an 'RL Data Filter' isn't explicitly mentioned; however, data filtering is indeed employed. **Specifically, easy problems with solely correct solutions and hard problems with only incorrect solutions are deliberately excluded.** The rationale behind this is to prevent the verifier model from developing biases based on problem difficulty rather than accurately assessing solution correctness. **This filtering strategy enhances the RL training process by ensuring a balanced dataset with contrastive examples**, leading to more effective learning and improved verification accuracy. This meticulous approach to curating training data is a crucial aspect of Heimdall's success in achieving high accuracy in verifying solutions, particularly in complex mathematical problems.

#### Auto. Discovery
Automatic knowledge discovery is an exciting prospect, suggesting a system that can autonomously expand its understanding of the world. This goes beyond simply retrieving information; it implies an ability to **formulate questions, seek answers, and, critically, validate the accuracy** of those answers. The paper's exploration of Heimdall in this context is particularly interesting. By using Heimdall to verify solutions generated by other LLMs (like NuminaMath), the system essentially builds a **self-checking loop**. If successful, such a system could **identify flaws in existing datasets**, refine its own knowledge base, and potentially even uncover new mathematical relationships. A key challenge would be ensuring the system doesn't simply reinforce existing biases or errors. A robust verification mechanism, like Heimdall, is essential to maintaining the integrity of the discovered knowledge. The ability to autonomously discover knowledge could revolutionize various fields, from scientific research to education, by accelerating the pace of discovery and reducing the reliance on human experts for validation.

#### Beyond Answers
While answering questions is a core capability, the realm of AI extends **beyond simply providing answers**. It encompasses understanding the underlying context, reasoning through complex scenarios, and adapting to nuanced inquiries. Future research should focus on equipping AI systems with the ability to **formulate their own questions**, identify knowledge gaps, and engage in a proactive pursuit of information. Moreover, **evaluating the quality and reliability of information** becomes paramount, preventing the dissemination of misinformation or biased perspectives. Ultimately, the true potential of AI lies in its capacity to **augment human intellect**, fostering a collaborative partnership where machines not only provide answers but also contribute to a deeper understanding of the world. This includes areas such as knowledge discovery, the system poses questions, solves problems and verifies.

It highlights the two key methods Heimdall uses: forward checking (verifying the correctness of each step in the solution) and backward checking (ensuring that conclusions align with established constraints). The example in the table demonstrates how Heimdall applies both methods, identifying correct steps and pointing out inconsistencies.  The 'red texts' mentioned in the original caption refer to the parts of the verification where these checks are explicitly performed. This example illustrates Heimdall's ability to handle intricate problems and its detailed step-by-step verification process.

(Note that a, b, and c need not be distinct; if b = c, then a’s vote does not change for
this update.) Every player updates their vote exactly once in each round, in an order
determined by the players (possibly different across different rounds).

The prompt was modified to focus on verifying each step of the proof process rather than simply assessing the final answer's correctness (as indicated by the red text in the original paper).

> 🔼 This table showcases a specific example from a synthetic dataset used to evaluate the Heimdall model. The example highlights a flawed solution to a math problem. The table presents the problem statement, the incorrect solution provided, the verification process undertaken by Heimdall (including its step-by-step reasoning), and Heimdall's final judgment on the solution's correctness. This illustrates Heimdall's capability to accurately identify and flag erroneous solutions within a synthetic dataset, a key aspect of its automatic knowledge discovery function.
