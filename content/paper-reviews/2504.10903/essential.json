{"importance": "This survey is important for researchers because it provides a **structured overview of efficient reasoning techniques**, which can enable the development of more scalable and practical AI systems. It highlights key challenges and opportunities, guiding future research directions to address limitations in current reasoning models.", "summary": "Efficient reasoning survey: Compressing chains of thought, smaller models, and faster decoding to boost reasoning with less overhead.", "takeaways": ["Efficient reasoning can be achieved through shorter reasoning chains, smaller models, and faster decoding strategies.", "Model compression and reinforcement learning are promising avenues for enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models.", "There is a growing need for better evaluation metrics that balance performance and efficiency in reasoning models."], "tldr": "Reasoning models have shown remarkable progress by generating Chain-of-Thoughts (CoTs), yet introduce computational overhead. This survey categorizes existing works into three key directions: (1) compressing lengthy CoTs into concise chains; (2) developing compact language models with strong reasoning capabilities through knowledge distillation, model compression, and reinforcement learning; and (3) designing efficient decoding strategies to accelerate inference. It addresses the urgent need for effective acceleration in reasoning models.\n\nThis survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in efficient reasoning, categorizing methods into shorter, smaller, and faster approaches. It highlights reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning techniques to shorten CoTs, model compression via distillation/quantization/pruning to build small models, and efficient sampling to accelerate decoding. By structuring the landscape of efficient reasoning research, the paper identifies key challenges and offers potential research directions, serving as a valuable resource.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore, Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.10903/podcast.wav"}
