We categorize existing efficient reasoning methods into three key directions based on how they improve reasoning efficiency: (1) make long CoT short (shorter); (2) build small language model with strong reasoning ability (smaller); and (3) let decoding more efficient (faster).", "description": "This figure provides a visual overview of efficient reasoning methods, categorized into three main approaches based on how they enhance reasoning efficiency.  The first approach focuses on shortening excessively long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) sequences by various techniques, aiming to make the reasoning process more concise without sacrificing accuracy.  The second approach involves creating smaller language models that retain strong reasoning capabilities, thereby reducing computational resource demands.  This is often achieved using model compression or other similar techniques. The third approach concentrates on optimizing the decoding process itself to speed up inference while maintaining the quality of the reasoning output.  Each category is illustrated with key methods and techniques used to improve reasoning efficiency.", "section": "Efficient Reasoning"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.10903/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Taxonomy of efficient reasoning.", "description": "This figure presents a taxonomy of efficient reasoning methods categorized into three main approaches based on how they improve reasoning efficiency: shortening long chain-of-thoughts (CoTs), building smaller language models with strong reasoning capabilities, and making decoding more efficient.  Each approach is further broken down into sub-categories with specific methods and examples. The methods are color-coded for easy identification of their respective approach.", "section": "3 Efficient Reasoning"}]
