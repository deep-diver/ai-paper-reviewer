GraphRAG retrieves community summaries but provides coarse-grained information. LightRAG incorporates one-hop neighbors, yet retrieves redundant nodes.

It illustrates the step-by-step construction of the heterograph, including the process of graph decomposition, graph augmentation, and graph enrichment", "description": "This figure illustrates the three main steps involved in creating the NodeRAG heterograph: graph decomposition, graph augmentation, and graph enrichment.  Graph decomposition starts with raw text data that is processed to identify entities, relationships, and semantic units, which are represented as different node types in the graph. Graph augmentation enhances this initial graph by incorporating higher-level information derived from node importance and community detection analysis. This results in the addition of attribute and high-level element nodes to the graph. Finally, graph enrichment integrates the original text chunks, adds HNSW semantic edges and embedding nodes, further enriching the graph with context and improving search performance.  The final result is a comprehensive heterograph that is highly optimized for retrieval-augmented generation tasks.", "section": "2 NodeRAG"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11544/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: This figure focuses on the querying process, where entry points are extracted from the original query, followed by searching for related nodes that need to be retrieved in the heterograph.", "description": "This figure illustrates the query processing steps within NodeRAG.  It begins by extracting entry points from the user's query. These entry points are then used to initiate a search within the heterograph, which is a knowledge graph containing various types of nodes (e.g., entities, relationships, semantic units). The search process identifies relevant nodes, including 'cross-nodes' \u2013 nodes closely related to entry points. Finally, these entry points and cross-nodes are filtered to return only the most relevant nodes for the final answer generation.", "section": "2.5 Graph Searching"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11544/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 4: Ablation analysis on PPR iterations.", "description": "This ablation study analyzes the impact of varying the maximum number of iterations in the Personalized PageRank (PPR) algorithm on the overall performance of the NodeRAG system.  The figure shows the accuracy and average number of tokens retrieved, as well as the average processing time.  It illustrates how different iteration counts affect the system's ability to effectively retrieve relevant information and the computational cost associated with that retrieval process.
