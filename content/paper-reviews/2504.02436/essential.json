Existing methods often struggle to balance element-specific consistency with overall coherence and text alignment, limiting their applicability in fields such as AI drama and virtual e-commerce. The primary hurdles involve preserving the fidelity of each reference element, ensuring coherent scene composition, and achieving natural-looking outputs. \n\nTo tackle these issues, **SkyReels-A2** proposes a comprehensive data pipeline to construct prompt-reference-video triplets for model training. It employs a novel image-text joint embedding model to inject multi-element representations into the generative process, balancing element-specific consistency with global coherence and text alignment. The paper also optimizes the inference pipeline for both speed and output stability and introduces A2-Bench, a benchmark for systematic evaluation. Experiments show that SkyReels-A2 generates diverse, high-quality videos with precise element control, outperforming advanced closed-source models and marking the first open-source commercial-grade model for elements-to-video generation.", "affiliation": "Skywork AI, Kunlun Inc.", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.02436/podcast.wav"}
