Foundation models have shown potential in ultra-low bit-rate image compression but current methods still relies on proprietary models or suffer from quality deviations. This paper addresses the gap and quantify the existing analysis of the design in the research area.\n\nThe paper introduces **PerCoV2**, a novel and open ultra-low bit-rate perceptual image compression system built on Stable Diffusion 3. It enhances entropy coding efficiency by modeling the hyper-latent image distribution with implicit hierarchical masked image modeling. The method conducts a comprehensive comparison of autoregressive methods and demonstrates its benefits for compression and generation, achieving higher image fidelity and perceptual quality.
