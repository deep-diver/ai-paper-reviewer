A causal VAE, by incorporating temporal dependencies in its encoding, likely results in **more efficient video compression** compared to standard autoencoders. This efficiency translates to faster training times and lower computational costs during video restoration.  Moreover, a causal approach may lead to **improved reconstruction quality**, as temporal information is preserved, enhancing the consistency and coherence of the restored video. The impact likely extends beyond computational advantages.  By better capturing temporal relationships, the causal VAE could facilitate **more effective temporal alignment and artifact removal**, particularly beneficial in handling real-world videos with varied degradation types.  In essence, a causal VAE's impact is multifaceted, affecting training efficiency, reconstruction quality, and the overall performance of the video restoration system.
