### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Reinforcement learning (RL) has become popular for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. GRPO, known for its success in training models like DeepSeek-R1, lacks clear understanding of its effectiveness. This paper revisits GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm view, analyzing its key parts to see how it works. Surprisingly, a basic rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which only trains on positively rewarded samples, performs comparably to GRPO and PPO. 



The authors found GRPO's advantage comes from discarding prompts with completely wrong responses, rather than reward normalization. Motivated by this, they suggest Reinforce-Rej, a policy gradient extension that filters both entirely incorrect and correct samples. It improves KL efficiency and stability, offering a lightweight alternative to complex RL algorithms. They recommend RAFT as a robust baseline and suggest focusing on principled designs for negative samples.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper provides **valuable insights** into reward-based LLM post-training by demonstrating the effectiveness of simple rejection sampling and identifying key factors that impact performance. It encourages a more principled approach to incorporating negative samples, **opening new avenues** for developing lightweight and effective RL algorithms. This work will help researchers to **focus on sample selection** rather than complex algorithmic designs.
