{"importance": "This paper is crucial for democratizing search AI. It provides an **open-source alternative that matches the state-of-the-art performance**, reducing reliance on closed solutions. This fosters innovation and opens new research directions in reasoning and search methodologies. ODS enables future work to **build upon a transparent**, high-performing search AI.", "summary": "Open Deep Search (ODS): Democratizing Search with Open-source Reasoning Agents.", "takeaways": ["ODS, an open-source AI search solution, achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks, rivaling closed-source alternatives.", "Key innovations include Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent.", "ODS improves accuracy on FRAMES, even surpassing GPT-4o Search Preview."], "tldr": "**Proprietary search AI solutions dominate**, limiting transparency and innovation. To address this, the paper introduces Open Deep Search (ODS), aiming to bridge the gap with an open-source alternative. ODS seeks to encourage community-driven development in search AI, harnessing collective talent. It achieves performance matching or surpassing closed-source options in benchmark evaluations, offering a competitive, transparent solution. \n\nODS augments open-source LLMs with **reasoning agents for web search**. It consists of Open Search Tool and Open Reasoning Agent. The Open Search Tool outperforms proprietary tools. Combined with LLMs like DeepSeek-R1, ODS nears or exceeds state-of-the-art baselines on SimpleQA and FRAMES. For instance, ODS improves FRAMES accuracy by 9.7% over GPT-4o Search Preview. This flexible framework enhances any LLM.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20201/podcast.wav"}
