A query is first fed into Open Reasoning Agent which orchestrates the available set of tools to interpret and answer the query. The most important tool is the Open Search Tool that we design, which provides a high quality context from multiple retrieved sources from the web. In our experiments we use Llama3.1-70B and DeepSeek-R1 as our base model.", "description": "The figure illustrates the architecture of Open Deep Search (ODS), an open-source framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) with search and reasoning capabilities.  Users can select any LLM as a base model.  The core components are the Open Reasoning Agent and the Open Search Tool.  The Open Reasoning Agent receives user queries and uses a chain of thought to determine which tools are needed to best answer the query. The Open Search Tool is a key component, designed to retrieve high-quality context from multiple web sources.  The figure shows the flow of information, highlighting the interaction between the LLM, the reasoning agent, the search tool, and other auxiliary tools like a calculator or code interpreter. The example uses Llama3.1-70B and DeepSeek-R1 as base models.", "section": "2 Open Deep Search (ODS)"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.20201/extracted/6310633/ods_v2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Illustration of the ReAct prompt structure utilized in ODS-v1.", "description": "Figure 2 shows the structure of the prompt used by the ReAct agent in ODS-v1.  The ReAct framework combines reasoning steps with actions, enabling iterative interactions with tools.  The figure illustrates this process with an example query, showing the structured sequence of Thought, Action, Action_Input, Observation, and Final_Answer steps involved in answering the question.  This iterative structure allows the agent to refine its understanding of the query and incorporate external information obtained through tools, leading to a final, accurate answer.", "section": "2.2.1 ODS-v1 with ReAct Agent"}]
