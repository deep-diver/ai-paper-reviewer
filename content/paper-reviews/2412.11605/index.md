### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Precise instruction-following in LLMs is important, and preference learning methods play a key role in achieving it. However, current methods often create preference pairs by sampling multiple independent responses, introducing irrelevant variations. For example, if the instruction is to write a story with a specific ending, the models might generate completely different stories, making it difficult to learn the nuances of the instructions. This issue hinders the effectiveness of preference learning and limits its potential for improving instruction-following abilities.

This paper introduces **SPAR**, a self-play framework with tree-search refinement to improve instruction following in LLMs. It addresses the limitations of existing preference learning methods by generating comparable preference pairs through a novel self-play mechanism. An **LLM acts as both actor and refiner**, generating responses and refining them based on instructions.  A **tree search algorithm** systematically refines responses, minimizing irrelevant variations and highlighting key differences. Experiments show that **SPAR significantly improves instruction following** across various LLMs, even outperforming GPT-4 on the IFEval benchmark.  The results demonstrate the importance of refinement and the **potential for continuous LLM self-improvement**.

It highlights how independently sampled responses can vary in content, such as different story titles (e.g., Hansel and Gretel vs. Little Red Riding Hood) which interferes with preference learning.  It then shows how refined responses maintain consistent story content and focus on the key requirement of the prompt, which is the ending sentence.

### In-depth insights


#### Self-Play Refinement
**Self-play refinement**, a novel training paradigm, enhances LLMs by iterative self-improvement.  A model acts as both "actor" generating text and "refiner" critiquing and improving it.  This feedback loop fosters continuous learning, focusing on subtle nuances crucial for complex instruction following.  By playing against itself, the model identifies and corrects its weaknesses, minimizing discrepancies between generated text and instructions. **Tree search** within self-play systematically explores refinement paths, ensuring significant improvement.  Unlike methods using independent responses, refinement pairs created via self-play reduce irrelevant content variations, highlighting key differences for effective preference learning.  This approach allows models to learn from their mistakes, boosting performance without relying solely on external data or human feedback.  The refiner's role as both judge and improver allows for scalable self-correction, potentially exceeding the initial bootstrapping data quality.

#### Nuance-Driven I-F
**Nuance-Driven Instruction Following (I-F)** emphasizes the profound impact of subtle variations in instructions on an LLM's output.  Ignoring these nuances can lead to misinterpretations and inaccurate responses, even when the core instruction is understood.  This highlights the need for models to be sensitive to not just the explicit directives, but also the implicit connotations and contextual cues embedded within the instructions.  Effectively capturing these subtle variations is crucial for achieving truly robust and reliable I-F capabilities, enabling LLMs to respond accurately and appropriately to the full spectrum of user intent.

#### Tree-Search Refinement
**Tree-search refinement** enhances instruction following by iteratively improving responses.  A **refiner model** critiques **actor model** outputs. Unlike directly sampling varied responses, tree search refines a single response, minimizing **interfering variations**. This targeted approach helps isolate crucial differences affecting instruction adherence, leading to more effective learning for the actor model via DPO.  The refiner uses breadth-first or depth-first search to explore potential refinements, judged for correctness.  Experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly boosts performance, even surpassing strong baselines. This suggests that highlighting key differences is crucial for preference learning in instruction following.

#### Iterative LLM Training
**Iterative LLM training** is crucial for progressive self-improvement in complex instruction following.  By refining model responses through methods like tree search and using these refined pairs for preference learning, LLMs can focus on key differences, minimizing irrelevant variations.  This iterative process allows both actor and refiner models to enhance performance reciprocally, surpassing capabilities achieved through standard training. The results demonstrate potential for continuous self-improvement without reliance on extensive external data, offering a promising direction for autonomous LLM alignment and instruction following tasks.

#### Bias in Self-Eval
**Bias in self-evaluation** of language models is a critical concern.  LLMs judging their own refinements can create a feedback loop, amplifying existing biases and hindering true improvement.  This **self-reinforcement of errors** can lead to overestimation of capabilities and a skewed learning process.  Mitigating this bias requires external evaluation methods, diverse training data, and techniques to **decouple self-assessment** from refinement training.  Exploring strategies like adversarial training or incorporating human feedback can offer more **objective performance measures**, crucial for building robust and reliable LLMs.

> üîº The figure illustrates the iterative training process of SPaR.  At each iteration *t*, there's an actor model (M_t) and a refiner model (R_t), both initialized from the same base model.  The actor generates responses to instructions, and the refiner critiques these responses, identifying negative (incorrect) examples. The refiner then uses a tree-search algorithm to refine these negative responses into correct ones, creating refined response pairs. These pairs, along with the refiner's judgments, are used to train the next iteration's actor (M_{t+1}) and refiner (R_{t+1}) via DPO and RFT respectively.  This iterative process fosters continuous self-improvement in both models, leading to enhanced instruction following capabilities.

> üîº This figure presents the results of a synthetic data experiment designed to isolate the impact of interfering factors in preference learning. Two tasks are used: Character Sequence Generation and Start/End Story Generation. In the Character Sequence Generation task, the model is prompted to generate a sequence of characters with length constraints. Interfering pairs are created by introducing variation in character case. Results show that the model quickly learns the uppercase ratio in interfering pairs but performs worse on the primary instruction following objective, as compared to training with refined pairs. The Start/End Story Generation task prompts the model to generate a story with a specified beginning and ending sentence.  Here, interfering pairs contain variations in the story's middle section, which is irrelevant to the given instruction. Results show that refinement pairs outperform interfering pairs significantly. Notably, training with interfering pairs leads to worse performance than the initial model.

> üîº This table presents an evaluation of various large language models (LLMs) on several general benchmarks. These benchmarks are designed to assess the overall capabilities of the models, including mathematical reasoning (GSM8k), question answering (TriviaQA), multi-task language understanding (MMLU), and code generation (HumanEval). The table compares the performance of different LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct, LLaMA3-8B-Instruct, GLM-4-9B-Chat, and LLaMA3-70B-Instruct, both before and after training with the SPaR framework. The results are presented as average scores across different iterations of training. The purpose of this table is to demonstrate that while SPaR improves the instruction-following capabilities of the LLMs (as shown in other tables), it does not negatively impact their general performance on these broader benchmarks.

> üîº This table compares the effectiveness of different decoding strategies for the refinement task, which is refining model responses to better adhere to instructions. It presents the accuracy achieved using each strategy. Specifically, it compares Greedy Decoding, Best-of-N, Iterative Refinement, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS).  The table also shows two different accuracy scores: one evaluated by GPT-4 (Acc-GPT) and the other by a specific version of the model being tested, the SPAR-8B-RFT-iter3 refiner (Acc-SPAR). This comparison helps assess the alignment of self-evaluation with external judgment.
