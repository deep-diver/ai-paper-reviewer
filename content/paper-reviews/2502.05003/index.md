### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are computationally expensive.  One approach to reduce costs is using quantized representations, but existing Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) methods struggle to achieve high accuracy at low bit-widths, often plateauing around 8-bits.  The open problem is achieving accuracy comparable to higher-precision models while significantly reducing computational resources. 



The paper introduces QuEST, a novel QAT method that solves this problem.  **QuEST uses Hadamard normalization and a new trust gradient estimator for accurate and fast quantization**.  It demonstrates that LLMs can be trained successfully with only 1-bit weights and activations, surpassing existing accuracy at much lower model sizes and significantly reducing inference cost. **Experiments show QuEST induces stable scaling laws, making it highly efficient across different hardware precisions.**

> üîº This figure illustrates the scaling laws observed when training Llama-family language models using QuEST, a novel quantization-aware training method.  Models ranging in size from 30 million to 800 million parameters were trained on the C4 dataset.  QuEST allows for the use of quantized weights and activations, with bit depths from 1 to 4 bits.  The experiment was conducted in a regime where the number of training tokens was 100 times the number of model parameters.  Importantly, the graph shows that higher compression ratios (fewer bits) require proportionally more training data to achieve comparable performance.  The results demonstrate that QuEST achieves stable training even at the extreme of 1-bit weights and activations (W1A1).  Furthermore, the 4-bit weights and 4-bit activations model (W4A4) trained with QuEST outperforms the baseline BF16 model in terms of achieving lower training loss at a smaller model size (Pareto dominance).

### In-depth insights


#### QuEST's Novel QAT
QuEST introduces a novel approach to Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) for large language models (LLMs).  Its key innovation lies in a **trust gradient estimator** that directly minimizes the error between the quantized and full-precision gradients. This contrasts with previous methods that primarily relied on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE), often leading to instability and inaccurate gradient estimations.  **Hadamard normalization** is cleverly incorporated to improve the accuracy of quantization by making the data distribution closer to Gaussian, which is vital for optimal fitting.  The method achieves **Pareto-competitive results with FP16**, demonstrating improved accuracy at lower model sizes, and enables stable training with extremely low-bit (even 1-bit) weights and activations, pushing the boundaries of current QAT capabilities.

#### Hadamard Transform
The research paper utilizes the Hadamard Transform as a **pre-processing step** before Gaussian fitting in their quantization method, QuEST.  This is a **crucial innovation**, distinguishing it from previous QAT methods that relied on learned normalization. By applying the Hadamard Transform, the data's distribution is shaped to better approximate a Gaussian distribution, improving the accuracy of subsequent quantization. This technique makes the subsequent MSE-optimal quantization more effective, **reducing quantization errors and thereby improving gradient estimations during backpropagation**. The authors suggest that the orthogonality and fast computation of the Hadamard Transform are key benefits, making their method more efficient than other methods.  The transform facilitates stable training, especially at very low bit-widths such as 1-bit, by mitigating the impact of outliers.  This is a significant advancement that contributes to QuEST's superior performance and ability to achieve a Pareto-optimal frontier in low precision training.

#### Trust Gradient Estimator
The core idea behind the "Trust Gradient Estimator" is to improve the accuracy of gradient estimation during quantization-aware training (QAT) by **reducing the impact of large quantization errors**.  Standard QAT methods often rely on the Straight-Through Estimator (STE), which can lead to significant inaccuracies, especially when quantization errors are substantial. The trust estimator addresses this by **explicitly minimizing the difference between the true, full-precision gradient and the noisy gradient calculated from quantized values**. It achieves this by assigning a "trust score" to each gradient component, based on its corresponding quantization error. Components with small errors are given high trust, while components with large errors (outliers) receive low trust, thus **reducing their influence on the final gradient update**.  This approach is particularly effective at low bit-widths where quantization errors tend to be larger.  The use of a Hadamard transform further enhances the estimator's performance by improving the distribution of weights and activations before quantization, ultimately leading to more stable and accurate training.

#### Optimal Precision Frontier
The concept of "Optimal Precision Frontier" in the context of large language model (LLM) training centers on finding the **sweet spot** between model accuracy and computational efficiency.  It's a Pareto-optimal frontier, where increasing precision beyond a certain point yields diminishing returns in accuracy improvements, while incurring significantly higher computational costs.  The research likely investigates how different quantization techniques impact this frontier, aiming to identify the minimum precision (bit-width) for weights and activations that maintains competitive accuracy while minimizing resource consumption. This involves analyzing the relationship between bit-width, model size, and training data, ultimately determining the optimal balance.  **Finding this frontier is crucial** for deploying LLMs efficiently in resource-constrained environments.

#### GPU Kernel Enhancements
Optimizing GPU performance for quantized large language models (LLMs) is crucial for efficient inference.  **GPU kernel enhancements** are essential in this context, focusing on accelerating computationally intensive operations like matrix multiplication with low-precision arithmetic (e.g., INT4).  The paper likely details custom kernel implementations, potentially leveraging libraries such as CUTLASS, to handle the unique data formats and quantization schemes employed.  **Efficient Hadamard Transform kernels** are also vital, given their use in the proposed QuEST method.  The optimization strategies probably include techniques for memory access optimization, exploiting data parallelism, and minimizing unnecessary data transfers to maximize throughput.  **Performance gains** are likely demonstrated through benchmarks comparing the custom kernels with standard implementations, highlighting improvements in speed and energy efficiency.  **The fusion of multiple operations** into a single kernel is also a critical aspect, minimizing kernel launch overheads.  The overall goal is to bridge the gap between computational support and achievable accuracy, enabling practical deployment of quantized LLMs on GPU hardware.

A higher fraction indicates that a larger portion of the weights are considered unreliable for gradient updates during that iteration. Two lines are plotted, one showing the results with the Hadamard Transform (HT) and the other without. The HT is a component of QuEST, and the figure demonstrates its impact on the fraction of masked weights.  The plot also includes a horizontal line showing the theoretically expected fraction of masked weights, assuming the weights follow a standard normal distribution. The comparison highlights how the Hadamard transform improves the approximation of the weight distribution to a normal distribution, leading to a more consistent trust mask.

> üîº This table presents the results of a zero-shot evaluation on the HellaSWAG benchmark, a test of commonsense reasoning.  It compares the accuracy of an 800-million parameter model trained using QuEST with 4-bit precision against a model trained with standard BF16 precision.  Both models were trained on 80 billion tokens.  The nearly identical accuracy scores demonstrate that QuEST's quantization-aware training preserves model performance, even with significantly reduced computational cost and precision.

> üîº This table presents the results of a hyperparameter search for the LSQ (Learned Step Size Quantization) method, focusing on the weight decay parameter.  The search was conducted for a 30-million parameter language model across three different bitwidths (2-bit, 3-bit, and 4-bit).  For each bitwidth, the table shows the validation perplexity (PPL) achieved with various weight decay values. The lowest PPL for each bitwidth, indicating the best-performing hyperparameter setting, is highlighted in bold.
