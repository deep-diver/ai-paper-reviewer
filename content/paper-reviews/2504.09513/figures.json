The contour is created by identifying the edges of the damaged area, effectively outlining the region requiring restoration. This process is important because the extracted contour serves as a conditional guidance for the AI model during the mural restoration process, ensuring the restored area blends seamlessly with the surrounding undamaged regions.  The contour acts as a kind of \"mask\" or boundary to guide the model's inpainting, helping to maintain the structural integrity and stylistic coherence of the restored mural.", "section": "Contour Extraction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.09513/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 5.
