Quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes, focus on asymptotic properties, but finite-size optimization lags.  Traditional methods like greedy algorithms struggle to achieve needed distances. Weight reduction, lowering check weight while maintaining code properties increases physical qubit overhead.\n\nThis paper introduces a versatile, computationally efficient method for stabilizer code weight reduction using reinforcement learning (RL). This method produces new low-weight codes that outperform current state-of-the-art results, drastically reducing physical qubit overhead.  The RL framework offers insights into code parameter interplay and demonstrates how RL can advance quantum code discovery, which paves the way for practical quantum technologies.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Optimization"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14372/podcast.wav"}
