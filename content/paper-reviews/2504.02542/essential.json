Generating videos driven by both audio and facial motion poses challenges like control conflicts, where signals interfere, and difficulties in aggregating signals effectively across spatial-temporal dimensions. Existing video diffusion models separately process these dimensions, missing important interactions. To tackle these problems, **ACTalker** is introduced. \n\n**ACTalker**, an end-to-end video diffusion framework, uses a parallel mamba structure with multiple branches to control specific facial regions with separate driving signals. A gate mechanism provides flexible control. The mamba structure and mask-drop strategy handle facial control with single signals in specific regions. Experimental results show that this method produces natural-looking facial videos driven by diverse signals and integrates multiple driving modalities without conflict.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.02542/podcast.wav"}
