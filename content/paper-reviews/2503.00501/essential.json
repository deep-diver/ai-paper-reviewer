{"importance": "This paper introduces Qilin, a new multimodal dataset for information retrieval, addressing the scarcity of high-quality resources. **It offers diverse data including user sessions and APP-level contextual signals, enabling the development of advanced S&R systems**. Qilin\u2019s insights and resources can significantly impact future research and industry innovations.", "summary": "Qilin: A multimodal dataset with APP-level user sessions for advancing search and recommendation systems.", "takeaways": ["Qilin is a novel multimodal dataset featuring user sessions with heterogeneous results from Xiaohongshu.", "The dataset includes APP-level contextual signals and user feedback, facilitating advanced multimodal neural retrieval models.", "Analysis of Qilin reveals insights into user behavior, DQA module impact, and query patterns, aiding in improving search and recommendation systems."], "tldr": "User-generated content (UGC) communities benefit from integrating visual and textual information into search and recommendation (S&R). However, the progress on multimodal S&R is limited by the lack of high-quality datasets. To address this, the paper introduces **Qilin, a multimodal information retrieval dataset collected from Xiaohongshu**.  Unlike existing datasets, Qilin offers user sessions with image-text notes, video notes, commercial notes, and direct answers, facilitating advanced multimodal neural retrieval models. \n\nTo better model user satisfaction and support analysis, Qilin collects APP-level contextual signals and user feedback. It includes user-favored answers and referred results for search requests triggering the Deep Query Answering (DQA) module, enabling training and evaluation of a Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and exploration of the module's effect on user search behavior. The paper provides findings and insights for improving S&R systems, **highlighting Qilin's contribution to multimodal content platforms with S&R services**.", "affiliation": "Xiaohongshu Inc.", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Datasets"}, "podcast_path": "2503.00501/podcast.wav"}
