### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for building figure question-answering (QA) datasets are expensive and time-consuming, hindering progress in visual language model research.  Existing synthetic approaches often fall short due to limitations in diversity, quality, and error-prone code generation.  This makes it difficult to create large-scale datasets needed for effective model training.

This paper introduces SBS Figures, a novel approach to generate synthetic figure QA data.  It utilizes a stage-by-stage pipeline, which ensures high-quality, diverse figures and accurate QA pairs.  The method is more efficient, and avoids many common issues, such as code errors, which are common problems with other LLM-based approaches.  The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by showing that models pre-trained on SBS Figures perform significantly better on various benchmark datasets.

### In-depth insights


#### Synth Figure QA
Synthetic Figure QA presents a novel approach to address the challenges in creating large-scale figure question-answering datasets.  Traditional methods are labor-intensive, requiring manual annotation of figures and question generation.  **This technique leverages LLMs to generate both synthetic figures and their corresponding QA pairs**, significantly reducing the manual effort.  The stage-by-stage generation process‚Äîstarting with data generation, followed by figure rendering using error-free Python code, and finally, QA pair generation‚Äî**enables efficient creation of diverse and high-quality data**. This approach not only minimizes errors but also allows for control over figure aesthetics and topic diversity.  The resulting dataset shows a **strong pre-training effect**, enabling efficient training of models with limited real-world data, significantly advancing the field of figure understanding.

#### Stage-wise Pipeline
A stage-wise pipeline offers a structured approach to complex tasks, breaking them into smaller, manageable steps.  This is particularly beneficial in synthetic data generation, where each stage can focus on a specific aspect‚Äîsuch as data generation, figure rendering, and QA pair creation.  **The modularity promotes efficiency** by allowing for code reuse and parallel processing.  **Error control is significantly enhanced**, as errors in one stage are less likely to cascade through the entire pipeline.  **Iterative refinement** is facilitated, permitting adjustments at each stage based on intermediate results.  **Flexibility** is increased allowing modification of individual stages to generate diverse outputs, thereby enhancing the variety and quality of the final synthetic data.  **Scalability** is also improved as each step can be optimized independently, thus making the overall process efficient for massive datasets.  However, careful design and coordination are needed between stages to maintain data integrity and ensure that output from one stage seamlessly feeds into the next.

#### Pre-train Effects
The research demonstrates a **strong pre-training effect** when using the synthetically generated SBS Figures dataset.  Models pre-trained on SBS Figures significantly outperform those trained from scratch or pre-trained on other synthetic datasets like FigureQA, DVQA, and PlotQA, achieving substantially higher accuracy on real-world figure QA tasks. This highlights the **effectiveness of synthetic data** in pre-training, particularly when carefully designed to encompass diverse figure types, styles, and comprehensive annotations (including dense QA pairs).  The superior performance is not limited to a single model architecture, further solidifying the dataset's value as a versatile resource for figure understanding.  Importantly, the ablation study shows that aspects like figure appearance diversity and QA quality directly impact the pre-training effect, underscoring the importance of a holistic, well-designed synthetic dataset.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model or system to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of a research paper focusing on figure question answering (QA), ablation studies would likely investigate the impact of various elements within a dataset creation pipeline or a model architecture. For example, **removing the randomness in figure generation** might reveal whether diverse visual styles are crucial for model performance.  Similarly, **testing the effect of different QA generation techniques** (e.g., template-based vs. LLM-generated) helps quantify the value of high-quality, varied questions.  **Evaluating the influence of data topic diversity** would assess whether a broad range of topics improves generalization. Ultimately, ablation studies aim to pinpoint the most critical factors, clarifying the model's strengths and weaknesses and guiding future improvements by isolating the impact of individual components.  Analyzing these results offers a **deeper understanding of the model's behavior**, highlighting which aspects of the dataset or architecture are most important for effective figure QA.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on SBS Figures could explore several avenues. **Improving the diversity and realism of generated figures** is crucial; while the current method produces variety, incorporating more nuanced data distributions, chart styles, and real-world data elements could enhance the training effect.  **Investigating different LLMs** and their impact on both figure and QA generation quality is warranted, possibly leading to better performance with less computational cost. The current research focuses on chart figures, and extending it to encompass other data visualization types like maps, diagrams, and images would significantly broaden the scope and impact.  Finally, evaluating the robustness of models pre-trained on SBS Figures against noisy or incomplete real-world data is necessary to assess their practical applicability in various real-world document understanding applications.  These directions would further establish SBS Figures as a leading resource for advancing the field of figure QA and visual document understanding.

> üîº This figure illustrates the three-stage pipeline used to generate the SBS Figures dataset.  The first stage involves generating visualization data (chart type, data topic, numerical data, text, and colors) and representing it in JSON format. The second stage uses pre-defined, error-free Python scripts to create chart images based on the JSON data. The final stage generates accurate and comprehensive question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the JSON data without requiring optical character recognition (OCR). This fully synthetic approach ensures high quality, diverse data, and eliminates the need for manual annotation.

> üîº This figure illustrates the three prompt templates used in the SBS Figures generation pipeline.  The pipeline is fully automated, creating data, images, and question-answer pairs without human intervention.  The templates are designed to elicit specific outputs from a large language model (LLM). The first template generates diverse data topics suitable for visualization. The second template, using few-shot learning (providing examples of the desired JSON format), generates formatted JSON data representing the visualization data (numerical values, labels, etc.). The third template, also using few-shot learning, creates relevant question-answer pairs based on the generated JSON data. The pipeline's efficiency is enhanced by code that dynamically adjusts prompts and context, optimizing the LLM's responses.
