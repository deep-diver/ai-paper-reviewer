Existing synthetic approaches often fall short due to limitations in diversity, quality, and error-prone code generation.  This makes it difficult to create large-scale datasets needed for effective model training.\nThis paper introduces SBS Figures, a novel approach to generate synthetic figure QA data.  It utilizes a stage-by-stage pipeline, which ensures high-quality, diverse figures and accurate QA pairs.  The method is more efficient, and avoids many common issues, such as code errors, which are common problems with other LLM-based approaches.  The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach by showing that models pre-trained on SBS Figures perform significantly better on various benchmark datasets.", "affiliation": "Kyoto University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Visual Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2412.17606/podcast.wav"}
