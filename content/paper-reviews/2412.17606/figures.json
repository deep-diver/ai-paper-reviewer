The figure highlights the stage-by-stage generation process used to create the dataset: starting with the generation of diverse data, followed by error-free code for rendering charts using this data and the generation of accurate, dense QA pairs without relying on manual annotations or Optical Character Recognition (OCR). The resulting dataset contains a wide variety of charts (with diverse topics and visual styles), making it well-suited for effective model pre-training and robust generalization to real-world chart data.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.17606/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Generation pipeline of SBS Figures. SBS Figures\u00a0was created using a fully synthetic method. First, we generate the visualization data, represented in JSON format, containing complete numbers, text, and colors.

Finally, we generate dense and accurate QA pairs from visualization data without the need for OCR.", "description": "This figure illustrates the three-stage pipeline used to generate the SBS Figures dataset.  The first stage involves generating visualization data (chart type, data topic, numerical data, text, and colors) and representing it in JSON format. The second stage uses pre-defined, error-free Python scripts to create chart images based on the JSON data. The final stage generates accurate and comprehensive question-answer (QA) pairs directly from the JSON data without requiring optical character recognition (OCR). This fully synthetic approach ensures high quality, diverse data, and eliminates the need for manual annotation.", "section": "3 SBS Figures Dataset"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.17606/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Prompt templates used in the generation pipeline of SBS Figures. We adopt few-shot prompting to ensure consistent formatting for both JSON data and QA generation. To improve efficiency, our pipeline includes code that repeatedly adjusts the context and prompts during the generation process.", "description": "This figure illustrates the three prompt templates used in the SBS Figures generation pipeline.  The pipeline is fully automated, creating data, images, and question-answer pairs without human intervention.  The templates are designed to elicit specific outputs from a large language model (LLM). The first template generates diverse data topics suitable for visualization. The second template, using few-shot learning (providing examples of the desired JSON format), generates formatted JSON data representing the visualization data (numerical values, labels, etc.). The third template, also using few-shot learning, creates relevant question-answer pairs based on the generated JSON data. The pipeline's efficiency is enhanced by code that dynamically adjusts prompts and context, optimizing the LLM's responses.", "section": "3 SBS Figures Dataset"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.17606/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 4: Example of SBS Figures\u00a0QA pairs.\nThe figures show diverse visual variations, with each data content containing around 2,000 combinations of visual components.
