Existing 4D methods fine-tune 3D models using data with geometric priors, like optical flow. However, accuracy declines with dynamic objects that violate geometric rules. To address this, researchers need a generalizable 4D model without extensive training. This paper asks if there are human perception methods for 4D reconstruction. \n\nThe paper introduces **Easi3R**, a simple, training-free method for 4D reconstruction via attention adaptation during inference. It uses DUSt3R attention layers to encode camera & object motion. By disentangling these maps, it segments dynamic regions, estimates camera pose, & reconstructs 4D point maps. Experiments show Easi3R outperforms trained methods, offering a scalable solution.", "affiliation": "Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.24391/podcast.wav"}
