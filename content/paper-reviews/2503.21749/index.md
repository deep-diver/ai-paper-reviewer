### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Text-to-image models often struggle with accurately rendering text and integrating it seamlessly into images. While accuracy has been a focus, the aesthetic quality & integration with image content have been overlooked. Existing datasets lack high-quality samples for training models to produce diverse, aesthetically pleasing results. Thus, the paper explores these challenges in visual text generation.



The paper introduces **LeX-Art, a framework for high-quality text-image synthesis**. This includes the LeX-10K dataset, created using DeepSeek-R1 for prompt refinement and multi-stage filtering. Additionally, the paper provides LeX-Enhancer prompt enrichment and two text-to-image models, LeX-FLUX & LeX-Lumina. The benchmark LeX-Bench & a new metric, PNED, are introduced for evaluation, demonstrating significant improvements.

### In-depth insights


#### Text & Image Aligned
**Text and Image Alignment** is crucial for high-quality text-to-image generation. Models must ensure that the generated image accurately reflects the text prompt's content, style, and layout. Poor alignment can manifest as missing text, incorrect font styles, wrong colors, or misplaced text elements. Datasets with well-aligned text and images are essential for training models that can generate visually coherent and semantically accurate results. Metrics that accurately measure the degree of alignment between the generated image and the input text are also necessary for evaluating and improving model performance. Effective strategies for achieving robust text and image alignment often involve fine-grained prompt engineering and data augmentation to train robust models.

#### LeX: A Data-Centric T2I
**LeX: A Data-Centric T2I Approach** suggests a paradigm shift in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. Rather than solely focusing on architectural innovations in models, it prioritizes the **quality and quantity of the training data**. This approach acknowledges that even powerful models are limited by the data they are trained on. By emphasizing data curation, LeX likely aims to create a dataset that is **more diverse, aesthetically refined, and representative** of the desired output characteristics. This could involve meticulous selection, cleaning, and augmentation of existing data or the creation of entirely new synthetic datasets. The benefits of a data-centric approach include **improved model performance, generalization, and robustness**. A well-curated dataset can also **reduce biases and enhance the fairness** of the generated images. Furthermore, this approach encourages **interpretability and control over the generation process**. By carefully designing the data, it becomes easier to understand and influence the model's behavior. The success of LeX hinges on the ability to create a dataset that effectively captures the complex relationships between text and images, enabling the model to generate high-quality, visually appealing, and semantically accurate outputs. It may also emphasize the importance of **scalable data synthesis techniques** for further improving T2I technologies.

#### PNED:Text Metric
**Pairwise Normalized Edit Distance (PNED)** is introduced as a flexible metric to evaluate how well generated text matches the input prompt. It addresses the limitations of Normalized Edit Distance (NED) in non-glyph-conditioned models, where text order may vary. PNED treats prompts and OCR-extracted text as unordered word sets, computing pairwise edit distances and applying penalties for unmatched words, allowing for robust text accuracy evaluation. By leveraging PNED, a more robust and generalizable metric for evaluating text accuracy across diverse T2I models can be provided.

#### Scaling the Dataset
**Scaling a dataset** is crucial for enhancing model generalization and performance. A larger dataset typically leads to better representation of the underlying data distribution, enabling models to learn more robust features and patterns. However, simply increasing the dataset size without careful consideration of data quality and diversity can be detrimental. **Data augmentation** techniques can artificially expand the dataset, but it's important to ensure that these augmentations generate realistic and meaningful variations. Furthermore, as the dataset grows, efficient data management and processing become essential to avoid computational bottlenecks. **Active learning** strategies can prioritize the selection of the most informative samples to label, maximizing the impact of each data point and reducing the overall annotation effort. The key is to strike a balance between dataset size, data quality, diversity, and efficient data handling to achieve optimal model performance.

#### Future: More Scalable
The idea of a "Future: More Scalable" approach to text-to-image generation is compelling. Scalability implies several key areas of focus. **Firstly, data synthesis** needs to be more efficient, perhaps through automated prompt engineering and active learning techniques to prioritize data points that most improve model performance. **Secondly, the models themselves** could benefit from architectures designed for scalability, such as those employing efficient attention mechanisms or knowledge distillation to transfer capabilities from large models to smaller ones. **Thirdly, evaluation metrics** must also scale, moving beyond human evaluation to automated metrics that reliably assess text accuracy, aesthetic quality, and alignment across diverse datasets. Successfully addressing these challenges would unlock the potential for text-to-image models to be deployed in a wider range of applications, with lower computational costs and greater accessibility.

> üîº The LeX-Art framework is composed of three key components: dataset construction, model fine-tuning, and benchmark evaluation.  The dataset is created using DeepSeek-R1 to enhance prompts and filter images, resulting in LeX-10K.  LeX-Enhancer, a prompt enrichment model, and two text-to-image models (LeX-FLUX and LeX-Lumina) are trained using this dataset. The LeX-Bench benchmark evaluates the fidelity, aesthetics, and alignment of visual text generation, using metrics like Pairwise Normalized Edit Distance (PNED).

> üîº This figure illustrates the data construction pipeline used in LeX-Art for generating high-quality text-image datasets. It starts with seed prompts that are enhanced using DeepSeek-R1, resulting in prompts that include detailed descriptions of visual attributes.  These enriched prompts are then used to generate images using a text-to-image model. The generated images and captions are then subjected to a multi-stage filtering process to ensure high quality and alignment. Finally, GPT-40 is utilized for knowledge-augmented recaptioning, where the captions are refined to precisely match the generated images, handling cases where certain words in the enhanced prompt were not accurately rendered.  The example showcases how an initial prompt is enhanced, an image is generated, and then the caption is refined to accurately reflect the final image.
