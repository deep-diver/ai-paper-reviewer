These methods introduce complexity, require extensive computing resources and can be prone to instability during training, hindering large-scale applications.  Newer methods address some issues but may create other problems. \nThis paper introduces REINFORCE++, a novel method that enhances the classic REINFORCE algorithm. **REINFORCE++ addresses these issues by integrating key optimization techniques from PPO, but without the need for a critic network**. This simplification leads to improved training stability and reduced computational overhead.  Empirical evaluations demonstrate REINFORCE++'s superior stability compared to GRPO and greater computational efficiency than PPO while maintaining comparable performance. The open-source availability further enhances its accessibility and use.", "affiliation": "string", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.03262/podcast.wav"}
