{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in NLP and AI interpretability.  It **directly addresses limitations of existing automated interpretability pipelines**, offering novel, efficient methods for generating more accurate and insightful feature descriptions. This work **opens new avenues for understanding complex language models**, improving model control through steering, and potentially resolving issues related to 'dead' features.", "summary": "Boosting LLM interpretability, this study introduces output-centric methods for generating more accurate feature descriptions, improving causal understanding and model control.", "takeaways": ["Existing automated interpretability methods often fail to capture the causal effect of features on model outputs.", "Output-centric methods (VocabProj, TokenChange) provide more accurate feature descriptions, especially for steering.", "Combining input- and output-centric methods yields the most faithful feature descriptions, outperforming existing approaches."], "tldr": "Automated interpretability aims to explain large language models (LLMs) by describing the concepts features represent. Current methods primarily focus on identifying inputs activating features which is costly, ignoring how feature activation causally impacts model outputs. This limitation leads to incomplete and potentially misleading feature descriptions, hindering accurate model understanding and control through 'steering'.\nThis research introduces efficient, output-centric methods to address these limitations.  By focusing on how feature activation affects model outputs (using steering evaluations and vocabulary projection), these methods generate more accurate feature descriptions. Experiments across various LLMs demonstrate improved performance over existing input-centric methods. Combining both input and output-centric methods further enhances accuracy.", "affiliation": "Blavatnik School of Computer Science and AI, Tel Aviv University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08319/podcast.wav"}
