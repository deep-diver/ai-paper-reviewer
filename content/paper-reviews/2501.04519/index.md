### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current approaches for training language models to solve mathematical problems often rely on large models or high-quality datasets, which are limited and expensive.  This makes it difficult to improve the reasoning abilities of smaller models.  The existing methods for training reward models also face challenges due to the scarcity of accurate step-by-step feedback data. 

The paper introduces rStar-Math, a novel approach that uses smaller language models and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to overcome these limitations. It introduces three key innovations: a code-augmented Chain-of-Thought data synthesis method, a new process reward model training method, and a self-evolutionary training process. These innovations allow rStar-Math to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various math benchmarks, even surpassing larger models in some cases.  The results demonstrate the potential for smaller language models to tackle complex reasoning tasks if trained effectively.

### In-depth insights


#### Self-Evolved Deep Thinking
The concept of "Self-Evolved Deep Thinking" presents a novel approach to enhancing Large Language Models' (LLMs) reasoning capabilities.  It leverages **iterative self-improvement**, where the LLM's reasoning process isn't static but dynamically evolves through multiple rounds. Each round refines both the policy model (which generates reasoning steps) and a process preference model (which evaluates the quality of generated steps).  This iterative refinement relies on **synthesized training data**, created using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS).  The key is the MCTS generates verified reasoning trajectories and step-by-step quality scores that avoid the need for manual data annotation, making the training process significantly more scalable and efficient.  The self-evolution aspect is crucial because it enables the system to progressively tackle more challenging problems and generates increasingly high-quality data, ultimately leading to **state-of-the-art performance** in mathematical reasoning.

#### Code-Augmented CoT
The proposed Code-Augmented Chain of Thought (CoT) method represents a significant advancement in generating high-quality training data for mathematical reasoning.  By augmenting the traditional natural language CoT with executable Python code, **the approach directly addresses the issue of hallucination inherent in large language models (LLMs)**. The requirement that the code successfully executes acts as a powerful filter, ensuring that only valid and coherent reasoning steps are retained.  This verification process not only mitigates errors but also enables the automatic assignment of Q-values through Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) rollouts, thereby eliminating the need for tedious manual annotation. **The integration of code execution within the CoT framework is a novel and elegant solution**, effectively combining the strengths of symbolic computation with the capabilities of LLMs for a more robust and reliable training dataset. This crucial innovation is a key contributor to the success of the rStar-Math framework, highlighting the potential of code-augmented techniques to improve the accuracy and generalizability of LLMs in complex reasoning tasks.

#### Process Reward Model
Process reward models are crucial for effective System 2 reasoning, offering fine-grained feedback on intermediate reasoning steps.  However, **training data is scarce**, requiring extensive human annotation or impractical-to-scale automatic methods which suffer from noisy scores.  This paper introduces a novel approach to training a process preference model (PPM) by avoiding na√Øve step-level score annotation.  Instead, it leverages the Q-values from Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to construct preference pairs, using a pairwise ranking loss to train the PPM. This method enables reliable step-level evaluation without intense human labeling, yielding a more effective model than traditional outcome-based or Q-value based reward models.  The iterative self-evolution method further refines the PPM by continually improving the quality of training data.  This strategy avoids the limitations of existing approaches which rely on superior LLMs for data synthesis and achieve state-of-the-art results in mathematical reasoning. The **novel PPM training method is a key innovation**, significantly improving the reliability and efficacy of the process reward component in the overall System 2 framework.

#### Self-Evolution Recipe
The 'Self-Evolution Recipe' section details a crucial iterative process.  The core idea is **bootstrapping**: starting with relatively weak small language models (SLMs) and iteratively improving them. Each round involves using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to generate high-quality training data, which is then used to train stronger SLMs and process preference models (PPMs). This self-improvement cycle, repeated four times, allows the system to progressively tackle more challenging math problems. A key innovation is the use of code-augmented Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, ensuring the accuracy of intermediate steps.  The PPM's design avoids the need for expensive manual annotation of intermediate steps, further increasing efficiency and scalability. The **iterative refinement** of both SLMs and PPMs through this cycle is the key to the remarkable performance improvements observed.

#### Limitations and Future Work
The study's limitations center on the **reliance on specific model architectures**, potentially limiting generalizability.  Future work could explore applying the methodology to diverse model types and problem domains, enhancing its robustness.  Furthermore, the **self-evolution process** could benefit from more sophisticated techniques, such as incorporating external knowledge or human feedback. Investigating the scalability and efficiency of the approach for larger datasets and more complex problems remains crucial.  Finally, a **deeper dive into the self-reflection capabilities** observed in the system, and whether it is a consistent feature or artifact of the methodology, would significantly improve the understanding of the deep thinking mechanism.

> üîº This figure shows an example of a Code-augmented Chain of Thought (CoT) used in the rStar-Math model.  The example problem is a word problem asking to calculate the direct distance from a starting point after a series of movements. The solution is presented step-by-step using a code-augmented CoT, where each step involves natural language reasoning (the NL CoT) accompanied by executable Python code. The Python code directly implements the reasoning described in the accompanying natural language. This approach ensures the correctness and verifiability of each step, mitigating the problem of hallucination often seen in large language models (LLMs) that generate only natural language reasoning steps.

Four different benchmarks (MATH, AIME 2024, Olympiad Bench, and College Math) are shown, each represented by a separate graph. The x-axis represents the number of solutions sampled during the test-time computation, and the y-axis shows the percentage accuracy achieved.  Multiple models are compared: OpenAI's o1-preview and o1-mini models, and the rStar-Math model with a 7B parameter policy LLM and a 7B parameter PPM, as well as a comparison using Qwen2.5 Best-of-N models with 7B and 72B parameter LLMs and a 72B parameter ORM. This allows for a visual comparison of how different models and levels of computational scaling (number of solution samples) impact the accuracy of mathematical reasoning across the various benchmarks. The plot shows that increasing the number of samples generally improves accuracy, but the rate of improvement varies for different models and benchmarks. It also highlights the competitive performance of rStar-Math, sometimes exceeding even the larger models with less compute.

The goal is to assess the impact of the reward model on the overall accuracy of the system.  The results show that both PQM and PPM outperform the ORM, demonstrating the benefit of using fine-grained feedback on the reasoning process rather than only considering the final outcome. The PPM achieved the best performance and enabled the model to reach state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing even the ORM used with a much larger model.
