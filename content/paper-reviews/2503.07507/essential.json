Existing methods rely on scene-specific training, introducing computational overhead and limiting scalability, hindering real-world applications. Addressing these limitations is vital for advancing 3D scene understanding.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel framework for efficient 3D semantic reconstruction. It uses pixel embedding disambiguation, semantic field reconstruction, and global view perception to reconstruct 3D scenes solely from 2D images. It achieves over 9-fold speedups and improved accuracy without pre-calibrated 3D data.
