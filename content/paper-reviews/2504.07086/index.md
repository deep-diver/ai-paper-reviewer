### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Language models (LMs) have shown impressive advances in reasoning, but current evaluations often lack transparency and rigor. This paper investigates the reliability of these advancements, finding that performance on mathematical reasoning benchmarks is surprisingly sensitive to minor changes in implementation, such as decoding parameters, random seeds, and even hardware configurations. Many reported gains stem from unclear comparisons or unreported sources of variance, raising concerns about the true progress in the field. The authors highlight the need for more standardized and reproducible evaluation practices to ensure that improvements are genuine and robust.



To address these issues, the paper proposes a standardized evaluation framework with clear best practices and reporting standards. Applying this framework, they reassess recent methods, revealing that reinforcement learning (RL) techniques often yield only modest improvements compared to previous claims and are susceptible to overfitting, especially on small datasets. In contrast, supervised finetuning (SFT) methods demonstrate more consistent generalization. The authors release all code, prompts, and model outputs to foster reproducibility and establish more rigorous foundations for future work. The research underscores the critical importance of robust, multi-seed evaluations for reliable performance estimates.

### In-depth insights


#### Reasoning Pitfalls
**Reasoning pitfalls** in language models are multifaceted, stemming from data biases, flawed evaluation metrics, and inherent limitations in understanding context. Models may rely on surface-level patterns rather than true reasoning, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. **Overfitting** on specific benchmarks can create a false sense of progress, while **lack of robustness** to adversarial examples highlights vulnerabilities. Moreover, models often struggle with **common-sense reasoning** and **causal inference**, indicating a gap between statistical learning and genuine understanding. Addressing these pitfalls requires careful dataset curation, robust evaluation protocols, and novel architectures that promote deeper reasoning abilities.

#### Seed-Induced Var.
**Seed-induced variance** refers to the variability in a model's performance that arises solely from using different random seeds during training or evaluation. This variance can significantly impact the reliability and reproducibility of results, especially in deep learning models, due to the complex interplay of factors such as initialization, data shuffling, and optimization algorithms. **Controlling and quantifying seed-induced variance** is crucial for ensuring fair comparisons between models and obtaining robust performance estimates. Techniques to address this variance include averaging results over multiple seeds, using variance reduction techniques, and carefully controlling experimental setups. Failing to account for seed-induced variance can lead to misleading conclusions and hinder progress in machine learning research.

#### Reproducible Stk
While the paper doesn't explicitly have a section titled "Reproducible Stk," the core theme revolves around **reproducibility in language model reasoning**. The authors advocate for a standardized evaluation framework, releasing code, prompts, and model outputs to foster transparency. This suggests the need for a **robust and consistent software stack** to ensure experiments can be replicated reliably. Issues like hardware variations and different evaluation frameworks are highlighted as sources of inconsistencies. Therefore, a 'Reproducible Stk' would encompass a **well-defined and documented software environment**, including specific versions of libraries, frameworks (like PyTorch and VLLM), and even hardware configurations (ideally using publicly accessible cloud instances). This standardization is crucial for the community to build upon existing research and to avoid drawing false conclusions based on irreproducible results. It further emphasizes the importance of **transparent evaluation protocols** to facilitate reproducibility and enable others to rigorously assess the validity of claims.

#### RL Overfitting
**RL overfitting** is a significant concern when training language models for reasoning tasks. **Reinforcement learning (RL)** algorithms, while promising, can easily overfit to the training distribution. **Small datasets** exacerbate this issue, as models memorize specific training examples rather than learning generalizable reasoning skills. This results in poor performance on unseen data or slightly different benchmarks. **Careful monitoring** of performance on validation sets and employing regularization techniques are crucial to mitigate overfitting in RL-trained models. Addressing **data curation** protocols for reasoning models also help mitigate this issue. **Out-of-distribution generalization** is an important metric to track.

#### Standardize Eval
**Standardizing evaluations** is crucial for reliable progress in LM reasoning. It requires careful control over variables like decoding parameters, seeds, hardware, and prompt formats. **Variance estimation** is essential, especially on small datasets where single-seed runs are unstable. **Model-specific hyperparameter tuning**, large context lengths and robust answer matching are also important. Transparent reporting of code, prompts, and outputs, along with uncertainty quantification, are vital for reproducibility and thorough comparisons.

> 🔼 Figure 2 illustrates the significant impact of random seeds on the accuracy of various large language models (LLMs) when performing mathematical reasoning tasks.  The results demonstrate a substantial variability in Pass@1 scores (the percentage of problems solved correctly in the first attempt) across multiple runs with different random seeds for nine different models. This variability is especially pronounced on smaller datasets like AIME'24 and AMC'23, exhibiting up to 15% and 13% variance, respectively, due to their limited number of test problems.  This underscores the unreliability of using single-seed evaluations to evaluate model performance, highlighting the importance of employing multiple seeds and averaging their results for robust performance estimates.

The x-axis represents the number of random seeds (K) used, ranging from 1 to 10. The y-axis shows the variance of the mean Pass@1 score, a metric that assesses the model's performance. The graph demonstrates that when using only a small number of seeds (K<10), the variance is very high, indicating unstable and unreliable results.  However, as the number of seeds increases, the variance decreases significantly, converging to a more stable level around K=10.  This illustrates that using at least 10 random seeds for evaluation is crucial for obtaining reliable performance estimates, especially for small datasets like AIME'24. The results for AMC23 and MATH500 datasets are presented in Figures 12 and 13, respectively.

The experiment sweeps across a range of `max_new_tokens` values for three different sized models (DeepScaleR-1.5B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-7B) across three different datasets (AIME24, AMC23, MATH500). The results show that the performance of all the models is highly sensitive to this parameter, indicating that insufficiently long generation limits lead to premature truncation of the model's responses and a significant decrease in accuracy.  Conversely, excessively long generation limits may lead to other issues such as repetitive or incoherent reasoning.

> 🔼 This table presents the Pass@1 scores achieved by two language models, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-1.5B and S1.1-7B, when evaluated using two different evaluation frameworks: lighteval and evalchemy.  The models were evaluated on the AIME'24 dataset using identical settings, excluding the evaluation framework.  The results highlight the impact of choosing different evaluation frameworks on the final performance metrics reported, even with identical model, data, and parameter settings.

> 🔼 Table 3 presents a standardized evaluation of various large language models (LLMs) on six mathematical reasoning benchmarks.  It compares the performance of different model types (Reinforcement Learning and Supervised Fine-tuning based models) across different benchmarks, showing Pass@1 accuracy (mean and standard deviation) calculated using the LightEval framework.  The evaluation controlled for factors such as random seeds, context length, and prompt templates. The results provide a more robust comparison of the relative performance of these methods than previous reports, highlighting that reinforcement learning methods do not produce significant performance gains and that supervised fine-tuning on reasoning traces generalizes significantly better.

> Table 3: A Standardized and Sober Compilation of LM-Reasoning Results. We report Pass@1 accuracy (mean ±plus-or-minus\pm± std) of all models across six math reasoning benchmarks under a standardized evaluation setup—results are averaged over ten seeds for AIME and AMC, and three seeds for the rest, using the LightEval framework with best hyperparameters tuned per method, 32,768 context lengths for all except 4,096 for Math models, and appropriate prompt templates. RL- and SFT-based variants are evaluated relative to their respective base or instruction-tuned models. Main takeaways—(1) RL-trained methods do not yield meaningful performance gains, (2) SFT on reasoning traces yields significant generalization.

> 🔼 This table presents a detailed analysis of the diversity collapse phenomenon, a concept suggesting that improved performance in top-1 accuracy (Pass@1) might correlate with a decrease in diversity across the top-k results (Pass@k, where k>1).  The table compares the performance of various RL-trained language models against their corresponding baselines across three different metrics: Pass@1, Pass@5, and Pass@10.  The 'delta' values shown represent the difference in performance between the RL-trained models and their respective baselines for each of these metrics. The results presented challenge prior research findings, indicating that RL-trained models do not consistently exhibit diversity collapse.  Specifically, the difference in performance between RL models and baselines for Pass@5 and Pass@10 are predominantly positive, counteracting the negative trends seen in Pass@1 at comparable rates. This suggests that improvements in top-1 accuracy do not necessarily come at the expense of diversity in the top-k results.

> Table 4: RL-trained models do not show a diversity collapse (Dang et al., ). We report the delta between Pass@k of RL-trained models and their corresponding baselines. Unlike reported in prior work, we observe no significant phenomenon of diversity collapse: δ⁢@⁢5𝛿@5\delta@5italic_δ @ 5 and δ⁢@⁢10𝛿@10\delta@10italic_δ @ 10 are largely positive, and are negative at similar rates as δ⁢@⁢1𝛿@1\delta@1italic_δ @ 1.

> 🔼 This table presents three different prompt templates used in the paper's evaluation: 'Math', 'Default', and 'No Template'.  The 'Math' template is specifically designed for mathematical problems and includes instructions, while the 'Default' template is a simpler query. The 'No Template' option consists solely of the question without any additional structuring or instructions. The table highlights the significant impact of these variations on model performance. In particular, instruction-tuned models show substantially different performance levels based on the prompt template used, indicating a strong sensitivity to the structure and instructions provided in the prompt.
