The problem is significant because high-fidelity 3D models are crucial for many applications but acquiring high-resolution multi-view images can be challenging.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach that leverages VSR models to address these issues.  Instead of fine-tuning VSR models, it introduces simple, yet effective algorithms to generate 'video-like' sequences of low-resolution images, eliminating artifacts, improving spatial consistency, and achieving state-of-the-art results on standard benchmarks. The proposed method utilizes ground truth images, avoiding the distribution mismatch problems associated with using rendered images.", "affiliation": "Sungkyunkwan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.11525/podcast.wav"}
