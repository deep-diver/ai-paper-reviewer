### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-video generation models heavily rely on paired video-caption data. However, existing captioning methods often fall short.  Short captions lack detail, dense captions hallucinate, and coarse captions miss fine-grained information.  These issues hinder generating high-fidelity videos consistent with text prompts.  Accurate, detailed captions are crucial for improving model performance and generating realistic and coherent videos from text descriptions.

InstanceCap offers an **instance-aware structured captioning** solution. This framework captures fine-grained details about individual instances within a video, including their appearance, actions, motion, and position, along with background and camera movement, creating richer captions.  A novel **auxiliary models cluster** assists by isolating instances, and an improved Chain-of-Thought process refines descriptions.  The authors also create a 22K **InstanceVid dataset** and prompt enhancement pipeline to validate their method. This approach significantly improves text-to-video generation by making descriptions more precise, minimizing errors, and improving realism.

### In-depth insights


#### InstanceCap Framework
The InstanceCap framework tackles **text-to-video (T2V) generation** limitations by enhancing caption detail and motion depiction.  It employs an **instance-aware structured caption** approach. This isolates and describes individual instances within a video. Key elements like appearance, action, motion, and position are specified. An **auxiliary models cluster (AMC)** extracts instance data from the video. Simultaneously, a refined **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** prompting process guides **multimodal large language models (MLLMs)** to generate concise, accurate descriptions, minimizing hallucinations. This structured captioning approach significantly improves **fidelity** between generated videos and prompts.

#### Instance-Aware Captions
**Instance-aware captions** enrich video descriptions by focusing on individual objects or "instances." This approach moves beyond general scene descriptions to offer detailed information about each distinct object within the video frame.  By identifying each instance, its attributes (like appearance, action, and position) can be described precisely. This granularity is crucial for text-to-video generation as it allows for more accurate and detailed video synthesis, ensuring the generated video closely reflects the intended content of the caption.  This method enhances **fidelity and control** in video generation and allows more nuanced video editing or manipulation based on textual instructions.

#### 22K InstanceVid Dataset
The **22K InstanceVid dataset** focuses on high-quality, short videos (2-10 seconds) featuring dynamic instances.  This choice prioritizes **instance-level detail** while aligning with the capabilities of current T2V models.  InstanceVid emphasizes **diverse instances and scenes** for broader applicability, balancing outdoor and indoor content to avoid scene bias.  The dataset's size, while substantial, raises questions about its sufficiency for pre-training large T2V models.  **Further exploration is needed** to assess whether augmenting InstanceVid or combining it with other datasets can improve its effectiveness for pre-training, which would enhance video generation capabilities.

#### Reconstruction & T2V
**Reconstruction in text-to-video (T2V) emphasizes faithful recreation of visual content from textual descriptions.**  This involves generating videos that accurately reflect the details, actions, and overall scene depicted in the prompt. Key challenges include preserving fine-grained details, ensuring temporal consistency, and handling complex multi-instance scenarios.  **Robust evaluation metrics are crucial, often incorporating perceptual similarity measures and human evaluations to assess fidelity.**  T2V models often leverage diffusion-based architectures, benefiting from instance-aware structured captioning for improved prompt understanding and generation quality.  **Future directions involve refining these models to better handle complex prompts and exploring advanced techniques for capturing subtle visual nuances and dynamics.**

#### Limitations & Future Work
**InstanceCap's reliance on object detection methods presents a key limitation**, impacting performance in instance-free scenes and requiring domain-specific fine-tuning.  The current scale of **InstanceVid restricts its use for large-scale pre-training**, potentially hindering broader applicability. **Future work will address these limitations by expanding InstanceCap to a more substantial video dataset**, enabling the training of larger-scale T2V models.  This expansion will enhance performance on diverse scenes and improve generalizability, unlocking the full potential of instance-aware structured captions for video generation.

> üîº This figure provides a high-level overview of the InstanceCap pipeline, illustrating the key stages involved in generating instance-aware structured captions. The pipeline begins with 'Prior Information,' which includes details like object class and camera motion.  This information is then fed into the 'Auxiliary Model Cluster.'  The cluster uses models like an object detector, SAM2 for instance segmentation, and tools for analyzing camera motion to process the input video.  These models help isolate 'Local Instances' from the 'Global Videos,' a key step in enhancing the fidelity of instance descriptions. The output of the auxiliary model cluster is then used to refine 'Dense prompts' into 'Structured phrases' using MLLMs. This process, further detailed in Figure 3, transforms complex video descriptions into concise yet precise instance-level captions.

It illustrates an enhanced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline that facilitates Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to accurately capture instances with precise descriptions. This pipeline leverages information interactions (highlighted by a red arrow) to guide MLLMs in generating detailed and precise descriptions of various attributes for each instance, such as appearance, actions and motion, and position.  The CoT interaction starts with a blurred background video derived from the original video.  Then it leverages global description and instance-specific prompts to generate descriptions of appearance and actions and motions. Finally combine these information with background details and camera movement obtained from global video to finalize the whole caption.

> üîº This table presents a quantitative comparison of InstanceCap and other state-of-the-art video captioning models.  All methods are evaluated based on their performance on the popular open-source T2V model, Open-Sora [35]. The table also includes results for CogVideoX-5B, Pyramid-Flow, and Open-Sora Plan, which are three other high-performing T2V generation models.  The comparison focuses on video generation quality achieved when these models are used with different captioning methods. The metrics used for evaluating video generation quality are based on instance level attributes including 'Single Action', 'Color', 'Shape', 'Texture', 'Detail' as well as 'Multiple Action', 'Color', 'Texture' for single-object and multi-object scenarios respectively.  The highest scores achieved by the captioning models and by Open-Sora across all metrics are highlighted in bold. The second-highest score is underscored.

> üîº This table presents 3DVAE scores, a metric evaluating video reconstruction quality by calculating the distance between latent representations of original and reconstructed videos. It showcases the effectiveness of this metric by applying it to videos distorted in various ways (blurring, compression, etc.) and comparing it to typical scores from T2V models. The 'Setting' column provides specific parameters for each distortion type.

| Instance Detail | Instance Detail | Hallucination Scores | Hallucination Scores |
|---|---|---|---| 
| **1** | Descriptions are extremely vague, imprecise, or largely inaccurate. Almost no specific details from the video are captured correctly. | **1** | Severe hallucination - Describes many nonexistent details, significantly misrepresents what is shown, or introduces extensive irrelevant content with many unrelated topics or external information. |
| **2** | Descriptions have major inaccuracies or omit many important details. Only a few basic elements are described correctly. | **2** | Frequent hallucination - Multiple instances of fabricated or misrepresented details and significant extra content introducing information beyond the video scope. |
| **3** | Descriptions are moderately accurate but lack precision in some areas. Core details are present but some secondary details are missing or incorrect. | **3** | Occasional hallucination - A few minor instances of fabricated details, misrepresentations, or the addition of extra content not covered in the video. |
| **4** | Descriptions are largely accurate and detailed. Most key elements and nuances from the video are captured correctly, with only minor omissions or imprecisions. | **4** | Minimal hallucination - One or two very minor discrepancies or limited introduction of external information. |
| **5** | Descriptions are highly precise and comprehensive. All important details from the video are captured accurately, including subtle elements and specific examples. | **5** | No hallucination - All described details accurately reflect what is shown in the video, with no external content added. |{{< /table-caption >}}
> üîº This table provides a detailed breakdown of the scoring criteria employed for evaluating both instance detail and hallucination aspects, combining intrinsic and extrinsic hallucinations within a unified evaluation framework. The 'Instance Detail' section assesses the accuracy and completeness of descriptions, ranging from extremely vague to highly precise. The 'Hallucination Scores' section evaluates the presence and severity of hallucinated details, categorizing them from severe (many fabricated details) to minimal (very few discrepancies).
