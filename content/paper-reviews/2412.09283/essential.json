{"importance": "**InstanceCap enhances text-to-video generation by improving caption quality.** It addresses the limitations of existing captions (short, dense, coarse) that affect video fidelity.  This work introduces a novel framework for creating **instance-aware structured captions**, focusing on detail and motion accuracy, which are crucial for generating high-quality videos.  The introduced **InstanceVid dataset** and **enhancement pipeline** further contribute to training and fine-tuning advanced text-to-video generation models, opening new avenues for research in video generation and captioning.", "summary": "InstanceCap improves text-to-video generation through detailed, instance-aware captions.", "takeaways": ["InstanceCap introduces instance-aware structured captions for text-to-video generation.", "A new 22K InstanceVid dataset is created for training and fine-tuning models.", "An enhancement pipeline improves caption detail and reduces hallucinations, leading to better video fidelity"], "tldr": "Current text-to-video generation models heavily rely on paired video-caption data. However, existing captioning methods often fall short.  Short captions lack detail, dense captions hallucinate, and coarse captions miss fine-grained information.  These issues hinder generating high-fidelity videos consistent with text prompts.  Accurate, detailed captions are crucial for improving model performance and generating realistic and coherent videos from text descriptions.\nInstanceCap offers an **instance-aware structured captioning** solution. This framework captures fine-grained details about individual instances within a video, including their appearance, actions, motion, and position, along with background and camera movement, creating richer captions.  A novel **auxiliary models cluster** assists by isolating instances, and an improved Chain-of-Thought process refines descriptions.  The authors also create a 22K **InstanceVid dataset** and prompt enhancement pipeline to validate their method. This approach significantly improves text-to-video generation by making descriptions more precise, minimizing errors, and improving realism.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.09283/podcast.wav"}
