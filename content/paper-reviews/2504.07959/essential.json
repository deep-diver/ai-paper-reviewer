Existing color constancy methods often struggle to generalize to new cameras. They require retraining or additional images from the test camera, limiting their practical use. Current methods can be computationally heavy, and some rely on additional information which is not always available.\n\nThis paper introduces **CCMNet**, a learning-based method that leverages pre-calibrated color correction matrices (CCMs) available in camera ISPs to achieve cross-camera color constancy. **CCMNet** transforms predefined illumination colors into the test camera's raw space using CCMs, encoding them into a compact camera fingerprint embedding (CFE). It uses a data augmentation technique that interpolates between cameras and their CCMs, improving generalization and achieving state-of-the-art performance.", "affiliation": "Yonsei University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Scene Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.07959/podcast.wav"}
