{"importance": "This paper is important because it introduces a novel approach to human relighting that can **handle various scenarios** with consistent results. This **advances the field** of image-based relighting and opens up possibilities for realistic and controllable human image manipulation in diverse applications.", "summary": "Comprehensive Relighting: A generalizable model for consistent monocular human relighting & harmonization!", "takeaways": ["Comprehensive Relighting enables controlling the lighting of humans with arbitrary body parts in any scene.", "The model leverages a pre-trained diffusion model and unsupervised temporal lighting for temporal coherence.", "The method shows strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence."], "tldr": "Existing image-based relighting methods often struggle with generalizability and controllability, typically being limited to specific scenarios like faces or static humans due to dataset scarcity and restrictions in modeling multiple light sources. These issues hinder their applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\nThis paper introduces Comprehensive Relighting, a novel approach that utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and unsupervised temporal lighting model. This ensures temporal coherence by learning lighting cycle consistency from real-world videos. It demonstrates strong generalizability and lighting temporal coherence, outperforming existing methods.", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03011/podcast.wav"}
