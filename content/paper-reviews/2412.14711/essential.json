Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models address this by activating only a subset of parameters, significantly reducing computational costs.  However, traditional MoE architectures often rely on non-differentiable routing mechanisms (like TopK), hindering performance and scalability.  This has led researchers to explore fully-differentiable alternatives.\nThis paper introduces ReMoE, a novel MoE architecture that uses a fully differentiable ReLU function for routing. This simple yet effective change enables efficient dynamic allocation of computation and superior scalability.  Experiments demonstrate ReMoE consistently outperforms traditional TopK-routed MoE models across various settings, showcasing significant improvements in both performance and scalability. The proposed adaptive L1 regularization effectively controls the sparsity of the model, further enhancing its efficiency.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.14711/podcast.wav"}
