However, existing benchmarks for evaluating Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) often have limited data size, focus on narrow domain. They lack structured knowledge distribution, making it difficult to evaluate the true capabilities of MLLMs in real-world complex scenarios. It is really difficult to have reliable benchmarks to assess their real-world reasoning capabilities.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces a new benchmark that assesses MLLMs' reasoning capabilities using real-world K-12 examinations across Math, Physics, Chemistry, and more. This benchmark features a large-scale dataset with detailed knowledge point annotations and answer explanations. Additionally, the paper presents a dynamic evaluation framework that mitigates data contamination by generating new test samples through bootstrapping. Experiments on this benchmark reveal current MLLMs' limitations in multimodal reasoning, which shows the potential for the next generation models.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05782/podcast.wav"}
