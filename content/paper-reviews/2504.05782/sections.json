"}}, {"heading_title": "Dynamic Eval", "details": {"summary": "Dynamic evaluation is a crucial aspect of benchmarking MLLMs. The paper recognizes that static benchmarks are vulnerable to **data contamination**, where test items appear in the MLLM's training data, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this, the study introduces a novel framework that dynamically transforms both textual and visual components of questions. This involves techniques like word substitution, paraphrasing, question type permutation for text, and image expansion, color shift and style transfer for visual elements. By **bootstrapping** new test samples in this manner, the framework aims to challenge MLLMs with unseen data, providing a more reliable assessment of their true reasoning capabilities. The dynamic approach ensures the benchmark remains relevant and robust as models evolve and training datasets expand.This mitigates biases introduced by memorization and superficial pattern matching, ensuring the evaluation genuinely reflects the model's capacity for reasoning and generalization. This framework effectively maintains benchmark integrity."}}, {"heading_title": "K12 Reasoning", "details": {"summary": "K12 reasoning, as presented in the paper, offers a structured and interconnected learning environment, ideal for evaluating MLLMs. K-12 education provides a **broad spectrum of subjects** that test knowledge comprehension and high-order thinking skills.

The development of effective benchmarks like MDK12-Bench is crucial for **assessing and advancing** MLLMs towards this goal. Overcoming challenges such as limited data scope, narrow domain coverage, and unstructured knowledge distribution is essential. **Dynamic evaluation frameworks** that mitigate data contamination and the sensitivity of MLLMs to contextual shifts are also key.

Building robust multimodal large language models (MLLMs) requires addressing vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and ensuring consistent performance across diverse data distributions. Key considerations for robustness include: **1) Adversarial Training:** Techniques to fortify models against crafted inputs intended to cause failures. **2) Data Augmentation:** Strategies to expand training datasets with diverse, realistic variations to improve generalization. **3) Uncertainty Estimation:** Methods for models to quantify their confidence in predictions, enabling rejection of uncertain cases. **4) Explainable AI (XAI):** Approaches to increase transparency, identifying potential failure points. Robust MLLMs are essential for reliable deployment in real-world scenarios where unpredictable or malicious inputs may arise. Addressing the robustness is a critical aspect for reliable reasoning."}}]
