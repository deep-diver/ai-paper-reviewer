### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Retrieval Augmented Language Models (RALMs) enhance LLMs by retrieving information, but often misalign with human preferences. Effective alignment is crucial for trustworthy and reliable responses, especially given the risks of generating harmful or biased content from retrieved data. Current methods, like supervised fine-tuning, lack feedback mechanisms to capture human preferences, highlighting a need for better alignment processes.  Reward Models (RMs) provide crucial feedback during alignment, yet their effectiveness in RAG remains underexplored. This paper introduces RAG-RewardBench, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate RMs in RAG settings. It includes four RAG-specific scenarios, utilizes 18 datasets with 6 retrievers and 24 RALMs, and employs an LLM-as-a-judge approach for efficient and effective preference annotation. Evaluating 45 RMs revealed their limitations in RAG and the minimal improvement of existing trained RALMs in preference alignment, emphasizing a need to shift towards preference-aligned training.

> üîº This figure illustrates two paradigms for training Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models: (a) traditional RAG training and (b) preference-aligned RAG training.  Traditional RAG training uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of question-document-response triplets.  However, this method can result in unfaithful or harmful responses.  Preference-aligned RAG training incorporates a reward model (RM) that provides feedback on generated responses.  This feedback is then used by a preference learning algorithm, such as PPO or DPO, to optimize the RAG model's policy, aligning it better with human values like helpfulness and harmlessness.

### In-depth insights


#### RAG RM Evaluation
**RAG-RewardBench**, a novel benchmark, rigorously evaluates Reward Models (RMs) within Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  It addresses **four key RAG challenges**: multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstaining, and conflict robustness.  The benchmark incorporates diverse datasets, retrievers, and RALMs, enhancing evaluation comprehensiveness.  An **LLM-as-a-judge approach** improves preference annotation quality and efficiency.  Results reveal existing RMs struggle with RAG scenarios and highlight that **current trained RALMs show limited preference alignment**, indicating a need to shift towards preference-aligned training.  The strong correlation between RAG-RewardBench performance and downstream RAG tasks emphasizes its practical value for developing and deploying effective RMs.

#### Preference Alignment
**Preference alignment** is crucial in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  Current RALMs, despite advancements, often lack robust alignment with human preferences. This necessitates a shift towards preference-aligned training paradigms, where reward models (RMs) play a central role. Evaluating RMs in RAG settings is complex, requiring **well-crafted RAG-specific scenarios**, **diverse data sources**, and **high-quality preference judgments**.  Existing benchmarks fall short, neglecting the nuances of preference alignment in information retrieval contexts. A dedicated benchmark focusing on **multi-hop reasoning, fine-grained citation, appropriate abstaining**, and **conflict robustness**, while incorporating diverse datasets, retrievers, and RALMs, is crucial for building RALMs that truly align with human values.

#### RAG Scenarios & Data
**RAG-RewardBench** introduces four key RAG scenarios: **multi-hop reasoning**, **fine-grained citation**, **appropriate abstain**, and **conflict robustness**.  These scenarios reflect real-world challenges and evaluate diverse aspects of RM performance. The benchmark incorporates 18 datasets spanning various domains, using six retrievers and 24 RALMs.  This diversity ensures **robust evaluation** and reduces biases.  This multifaceted approach allows for the comprehensive assessment of reward models within diverse and challenging RAG settings.

#### LLM-as-a-Judge
**LLM-as-a-Judge** signifies using LLMs for preference evaluation, mimicking human judgment.  This approach offers **scalability**, crucial for RAG where context length hinders manual annotation. It entails LLMs scoring responses based on defined criteria (accuracy, relevance, etc.), averaging scores for a final judgment.  While promising, it raises key questions: Does LLM judgment truly align with human preferences? How do we mitigate potential LLM biases? RAG context length further complicates evaluation, necessitating specialized benchmarks.  Despite these challenges, LLM-as-a-Judge is vital for aligning complex RAG systems with user needs, opening exciting research avenues.

#### Future of Aligned RAG
**Preference alignment** is crucial for trustworthy and helpful Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  Current SFT training for RALMs shows minimal alignment improvement, making **preference-aligned training** vital. This involves reward models (RMs) providing feedback, guiding algorithms like PPO and DPO to optimize responses.  Developing **specialized RMs for RAG** is key. They should address the nuances of long contexts and unique RAG scenarios like multi-hop reasoning, citation accuracy, and conflict robustness.  Effective RMs will **improve both alignment and downstream task performance** like Best-of-N sampling.  Further research on process-level or more fine-grained reward signals could significantly enhance alignment.

> üîº RAG-RewardBench constructs preference pairs from diverse sources of datasets, retrievers, and RALMs and employs LLMs as judges to enhance annotation quality. Initially, real-world queries are collected from 18 datasets across various domains, and those queries are sent to six different retrievers to fetch relevant documents. The retrieved documents, along with the queries, serve as the input to 24 RALMs, which then generate corresponding responses. Subsequently, these generated responses are evaluated and rated by four distinct commercial LLMs acting as judges based on pre-defined criteria. After filtering out responses with inconsistent scores, high-quality preference pairs are selected for evaluating the performance of Reward Models (RMs). The figure also shows an example of preference judgment by LLMs on three different responses generated by various RALMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the construction process.

The x-axis represents the chosen-rejected score gap in RAG-RewardBench, and the y-axis represents the chosen-rejected score gap of the reward model. For each scenario (Helpful, Reasoning, Citation) a separate line graph visualizes the relationship, showing the reward model‚Äôs predicted score difference as the benchmark's score difference changes.  The graphs demonstrate that as the score gap in the benchmark increases (making the preference more clear), both models also tend to predict a larger score difference, indicating they find it easier to discriminate between responses when the benchmark's preference is stronger. The figure suggests that the difficulty of reward model evaluation can be adjusted by controlling the score difference in the preference pairs.
