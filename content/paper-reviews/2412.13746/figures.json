Traditional RAG training uses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of question-document-response triplets.  However, this method can result in unfaithful or harmful responses.  Preference-aligned RAG training incorporates a reward model (RM) that provides feedback on generated responses.  This feedback is then used by a preference learning algorithm, such as PPO or DPO, to optimize the RAG model's policy, aligning it better with human values like helpfulness and harmlessness.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.13746/x5.png", "caption": "Figure 2: The construction process of RAG-RewardBench.", "description": "RAG-RewardBench constructs preference pairs from diverse sources of datasets, retrievers, and RALMs and employs LLMs as judges to enhance annotation quality. Initially, real-world queries are collected from 18 datasets across various domains, and those queries are sent to six different retrievers to fetch relevant documents. The retrieved documents, along with the queries, serve as the input to 24 RALMs, which then generate corresponding responses. Subsequently, these generated responses are evaluated and rated by four distinct commercial LLMs acting as judges based on pre-defined criteria. After filtering out responses with inconsistent scores, high-quality preference pairs are selected for evaluating the performance of Reward Models (RMs). The figure also shows an example of preference judgment by LLMs on three different responses generated by various RALMs, demonstrating the effectiveness of the construction process.", "section": "3 The RAG-RewardBench Benchmark"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.13746/x6.png", "caption": "Figure 3: The source model distribution.", "description": "This figure presents a pie chart illustrating the distribution of source models used in generating responses for RAG-RewardBench.
