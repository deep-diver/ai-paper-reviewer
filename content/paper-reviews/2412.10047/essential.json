{"importance": "**This paper introduces a novel approach to building Large Action Models (LAMs), a crucial step towards more practical and interactive AI.**  Researchers benefit from the detailed, step-by-step guide for developing LAMs, from data collection to deployment.  The focus on bridging the gap between language understanding and real-world action execution opens exciting possibilities for future research in areas like robotics, autonomous systems, and human-computer interaction.", "summary": "From language models to action models: building AI that *does* things.", "takeaways": ["Large Action Models (LAMs) are introduced to bridge the gap between language understanding and real-world action execution.", "A four-phase training approach is proposed to develop LAMs from scratch, including task-plan pretraining, learning from experts, self-boosting exploration, and learning from a reward model.", "LAMs achieve competitive accuracy and superior efficiency compared to traditional LLMs in complex, multi-step real-world task completion within a Windows OS environment using a GUI agent called UFO"], "tldr": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at understanding and generating text.  However, they struggle to perform real-world actions.  This limits their use in applications requiring interaction with the environment, like controlling software or robots.  There's a need for AI that can not only understand but *act*. Current LLMs excel in textual tasks but lack real-world action execution. This limits their application in interactive environments.  Building agents with LLMs is challenging, requiring data and expertise.  There's a gap between language processing and tangible action.This paper introduces **Large Action Models (LAMs), which are designed to generate and execute actions** within dynamic environments.  A **detailed four-phase training process** transforms an LLM into a LAM. The process includes **data collection**, **model training**, **integration with a Windows OS GUI agent**, **grounding**, and **evaluation**. The approach focuses on teaching the model to plan, imitate expert demonstrations, explore new solutions, and learn from feedback. This study bridges the gap between language and action, enabling AI to perform complex real-world tasks efficiently.", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2412.10047/podcast.wav"}
