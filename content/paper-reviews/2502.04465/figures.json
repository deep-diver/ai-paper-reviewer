These features are then mapped to a low-dimensional space by the compressor, binary quantized, and projected back by the decompressor.

The encoder processes the input audio to extract features rich in both acoustic and semantic information. These features are compressed into a low-dimensional representation by the compressor module. This compressed representation is then quantized using a binary codebook. A decompressor module reconstructs the compressed features from this quantized representation. Finally, the decoder uses the reconstructed features to generate the output waveform, completing the speech coding process.", "section": "3. FocalCodec"}]
