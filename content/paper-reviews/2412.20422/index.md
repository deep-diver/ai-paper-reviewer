### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-4D methods lack control over the appearance of generated 4D content and often significantly alter the input object when introducing dynamics. This paper introduces 3to4D, a novel method that animates user-provided 3D objects while preserving their visual identity.  It uses a two-stage process: first, it creates a static 4D representation of the object, then uses an image-to-video diffusion model to animate the object based on a text prompt. 



To improve the realism of the generated animations, 3to4D introduces an incremental viewpoint selection protocol and a masked SDS loss. The incremental viewpoint selection gradually increases the viewpoint diversity during the generation process, which enhances the dynamic motion, while the masked SDS loss focuses the optimization on the relevant parts of the object, maintaining the original identity. This approach allows users to generate high-quality 4D animations that are both visually appealing and consistent with the input object and the text description. **The experimental results demonstrate that 3to4D outperforms baseline methods in terms of visual quality and dynamic realism,** effectively bridging the gap between static 3D assets and animated 4D content.

### In-depth insights


#### 4D Anim. from 3D
The concept of generating 4D animations directly from 3D models presents a significant advancement in digital content creation.  This approach bypasses the traditional two-stage process (first generating a static 3D object, then adding dynamics), which often results in loss of the original object's identity.  **Direct 4D animation offers greater control and efficiency**.  Instead of relying solely on text prompts, which can lead to unpredictable results, using existing 3D models as a base ensures that the generated animation maintains the appearance and geometry of the original.  This is crucial for applications requiring precise control over the visual output.  **Challenges remain in seamlessly integrating motion while preserving the original object's features.**  Techniques like employing a static 4D Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to capture the initial object's properties, combined with image-to-video diffusion models to add animation, show promise. However, the methods need improvements in handling dynamic movements and maintaining high visual fidelity throughout the animation. **Future research should focus on enhancing motion realism and ensuring robust preservation of the input object's identity**.

#### SDS & Viewpoint
The paper introduces a novel approach to 4D object animation by combining Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) with an innovative viewpoint selection strategy.  **SDS loss is crucial for guiding the optimization of the animation process**.  However, the authors observed that conventional random viewpoint sampling often produces inconsistent and unrealistic motions. To address this, they propose an **incremental viewpoint selection protocol**. This approach begins with a narrow field of view and gradually expands the range of viewpoints over time. **This incremental approach ensures greater consistency between viewpoints, resulting in improved optimization and more dynamic motion generation.** This strategy cleverly balances exploration of potential motion variation with stable optimization, enabling the 4D model to learn more realistic movements.  The combination of SDS and the new viewpoint strategy allows the system to maintain the identity and visual fidelity of the original 3D object while simultaneously generating compelling and coherent dynamic content. It emphasizes the importance of controlling the sampling process of training data, which directly impacts the quality of the animation.

#### 3to4D: Method
The core of the 3to4D method lies in its two-stage approach.  First, it **initializes a static 4D representation from a provided 3D object**. This is achieved by training a neural radiance field (NeRF) to accurately capture the object's visual attributes (RGB, depth, normals) from multiple viewpoints, ensuring consistency across the temporal dimension.  Secondly, **dynamics are added** to this static representation using an image-to-video diffusion model conditioned on the object and a text prompt.  **Two key innovations** are presented to enhance realism and control. An incremental viewpoint selection protocol gradually expands the sampling range during optimization, promoting more dynamic motion. A masked score distillation sampling (SDS) loss leverages attention maps to focus optimization on object-relevant areas, minimizing interference from irrelevant background elements, thus preserving object identity throughout the animation. This refined process results in 4D animations that are temporally coherent, prompt-adherent, and visually faithful to the original 3D object, showcasing a significant improvement over existing methods.

#### Ablation Study
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to determine their individual contributions.  In the context of this research, an ablation study on a 3D-to-4D animation model would likely investigate the impact of key elements such as the **image-to-video diffusion model**, the **viewpoint selection strategy**, and the **masked SDS loss**.  Removing each component in turn, and comparing the results against the full model, reveals how much each contributes to overall performance.  **Improved motion smoothness, visual quality, and fidelity to the original 3D object** would be key metrics. The study would likely show the importance of each element: that the image-to-video model is crucial for creating realistic motion, the viewpoint sampling improves motion dynamism, and the masked SDS loss ensures accurate animation without losing object identity.  **Significant drops in performance metrics** upon removing a component indicate its critical role in the success of the model.  The ablation study, therefore, provides valuable insights into the model's architecture and identifies which components are essential for achieving high-quality 4D animations.

#### Future Work
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the handling of complex object interactions and articulated movements** is crucial for generating more realistic and nuanced animations.  Addressing limitations in handling intricate details, such as fine textures and complex geometries, would enhance visual fidelity.  Expanding the approach to handle a broader range of object categories and motion types would broaden the applicability of the system.  **Investigating alternative neural architectures** for representing 4D scenes could lead to improved efficiency and scalability.  **Exploring different methods for incorporating textual prompts** might enable finer control over the generated animation's style and characteristics. Furthermore, research could focus on developing more robust and efficient training procedures to reduce computational costs and improve the model's generalization capabilities.  Finally, **integration with other tools and platforms** within virtual and augmented reality environments would unlock new applications and extend the system's impact.

It begins by training a static 4D Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) from the input 3D object to capture its appearance consistently across time. Dynamics are then added using an image-to-video diffusion model and a novel incremental viewpoint selection protocol that gradually expands the sampling range of viewpoints.  This enhances motion realism.  The process also incorporates a masked Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss, leveraging attention maps to focus optimization on the object and prevent unwanted background effects.

First, a 4D NeRF is trained to represent the static object (plant, left), having the same input structure at each time step. Then, we introduce dynamics to the 4D NeRF by distilling the prior from a pre-trained image-to-video model. At each SDS step, we select a viewpoint and render both the input object and the 4D NeRF from the same selected viewpoint. These renders, along with the textual prompts, are then fed into the image-to-video model, and the SDS loss is calculated to guide the generation of motion while preserving the object’s identity. The attention-masked SDS, focuses learning on the relevant parts of the object, improving identity preservation.
