The methods are: Incremental (the authors' proposed method), Uniform (random sampling), Deterministic (a systematic sweep), and Sweep (a gradual expansion of the sampling range).  The comparison focuses on the impact of the viewpoint sampling strategy on the quality of the generated animations.  Key metrics include LPIPS (perceptual similarity), CLIP-I (image-text similarity), Style (textual coherence with visual features), Smoothness (motion continuity), LPIPS-F (frame-to-frame perceptual similarity), and Dynamic Degree (amount of motion). The results show that the Incremental method balances visual similarity with randomness, resulting in a better preservation of 3D object perspective across time while also achieving high dynamic variability compared to the other methods.", "section": "5.
