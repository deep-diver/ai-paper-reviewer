### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Joint audio-video (AV) generation struggles with quality, synchronization, and infinite duration. Existing methods often focus on single modalities or have limited video lengths. Techniques like MM-Diffusion are restricted in video duration, while auto-regressive approaches suffer from error accumulation. Rolling Diffusion improves quality but lacks audio track generation, highlighting the need for solutions addressing all these challenges.



RFLAV, a novel transformer-based architecture, tackles these issues. It employs rolling flow matching for infinite AV generation, explores cross-modality interaction modules, and identifies a lightweight temporal fusion module for effective audio-visual alignment. Experiments show RFLAV outperforms existing models in quality and consistency, enabling unrestricted AV sequence generation.

> üîº This figure presents a detailed architectural overview of the RFLAV model, illustrating the processing pathways for both audio and video streams.  The model incorporates a rolling flow matching mechanism. It begins with separate encoding of audio and video data, which avoids early fusion, allowing for efficient intra-modality interactions (like self-attention) before cross-modality processing.  The figure shows the flow of information through various modules, including VAE encoder/decoder, Mel encoder, HiFi-GAN, and RFLAV blocks.  This architecture is explicitly designed to generate videos of arbitrary length, unlike models restricted by fixed-size encoders.  It emphasizes the three proposed alternatives for cross-modality interaction within the RFLAV block.

### In-depth insights


#### AV Infinite Gen.
The concept of "AV Infinite Gen." is intriguing, representing a significant leap in generative AI. The aim is to create audio-visual content of unlimited duration, a challenge that demands high-quality output, seamless multimodal synchronization, and long-term temporal coherence. **Breaking free from fixed-length constraints** is pivotal, enabling dynamic and evolving narratives. Key to achieving this is tackling error accumulation in auto-regressive models and maintaining consistency over extended periods. Solutions like **rolling diffusion** offer promise by focusing on local temporal relationships, but integrating robust audio synchronization is crucial. Future research should explore architectures that can handle the complexities of infinite generation, ensuring both visual and auditory fidelity while preserving computational efficiency and temporal coherence. The ultimate success of 'AV Infinite Gen.' hinges on its ability to create immersive and engaging experiences without the artifacts and limitations of current generative methods.

#### RFLAV: Details
The RFLAV architecture introduces a novel approach to audio-video (AV) generation by leveraging a transformer-based model without relying on traditional video or audio encoders. This **design choice enables the generation of videos of arbitrary lengths**, a significant advancement. RFLAV processes video and audio in parallel branches, delaying modality fusion to encourage initial intra-modality interaction via self-attention. The architecture's core, the RFLAV block, features separate video and audio branches, with the video branch applying both spatial and temporal attention. A key innovation is the **custom DiT adaptive layer normalization (AdaLN)**, which modulates features based on timestep embeddings and optional class conditioning. RFLAV explores three cross-modality fusion blocks, with the most effective one incorporating timestep and class information to enhance cross-modal understanding. The model employs a rolling rectified-flow matching framework, modifying the rolling diffusion methodology to facilitate training with rectified flow matching. This **ensures high-quality, coherent video generation with synchronized audio**, avoiding the limitations of fixed-length or auto-regressive approaches.

#### Flow Matching
The paper leverages **Flow Matching** as a crucial component for achieving high-quality audio-video generation. Flow matching is essential to guide the sample from noise to data distribution by predicting the velocity vector. **A loss function is defined to quantify the difference between predicted and actual velocity**. This technique, combined with rolling diffusion, allows the model to create temporally coherent and synchronized AV content, effectively addressing the challenges of infinite video generation. The authors have also modified the standard loss by incorporating the weight factor to help further control the framework. In rolling flow matching they use equations to define the forward process to take noisy video and audio embeddings.

#### Ablation Studies
The ablation study meticulously investigates the impact of various components within the proposed RFLAV architecture, offering valuable insights into their individual contributions. The comparison of different cross-modality interaction blocks (a, b, and c) reveals that block (c), which incorporates timestep and class conditioning embeddings with a lightweight temporal averaging mechanism, achieves superior performance, suggesting a more effective and efficient approach for fusing audio and video modalities. Further exploration of varying window sizes (5, 10, and 20 frames) uncovers an optimal balance at 10 frames, indicating the importance of capturing sufficient temporal context without introducing redundant information or noise. **These findings highlight the design choices in RFLAV and provide a solid foundation for understanding its effectiveness in joint audio-video generation**. The improvements achieved with block (c) suggest the importance of temporal conditioning and modality fusion, while the ideal window size of 10 frames points to the need to consider both short-term dynamics and long-term coherence. **This level of detail is essential for assessing the robustness and generalizability of the model across different datasets and tasks**.

#### Loop Detection
The approach to detect looping sequences in generated videos leverages the Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) metric to compute frame-to-frame similarity, constructing a matrix where each entry reflects the similarity between frames. By averaging off-diagonal similarity values, a function r(k) is derived, with peaks indicating repetitive patterns occurring k frames apart. Analyzing the Fourier transform of r(k) enables identification of dominant frequency components, helping to discern if the generated videos contain recurring sequences. This method distinguishes genuine motion dynamics from mere repetitions, ensuring the model's capacity to create diverse and extended video sequences. A key finding is that while real-world videos often exhibit clear looping patterns, the generated content demonstrates significantly reduced looping, validating the model's ability to produce novel and non-repetitive motion dynamics. It highlights the importance of assessing temporal coherence and originality in generative models beyond traditional metrics.

> üîº Figure 4 illustrates the rolling diffusion process used in the RFLAV model for video generation.  (a) shows the 'rolling phase', where a sliding window processes video frames. At each step, the model denoises the oldest frame in the window (red), and then removes it. A new, fully noisy frame (blue) is then added to the end of the window to keep the window size constant.  This process continues, enabling the generation of arbitrarily long video sequences. (b) shows the 'pre-rolling phase', which initializes the process. Here, the window starts with all frames completely noisy, gradually denoising until it is ready to transition into the rolling phase.
