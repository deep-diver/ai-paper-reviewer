Current synthetic image detection methods lack artifact-level interpretability, are overly focused on image manipulation detection, and datasets have outdated generators and lack fine-grained annotations. To address these issues, this paper introduces SynthScars, a high-quality, diverse dataset consisting of fully synthetic images with human-expert annotations, featuring distinct image content types, categories of artifacts, and fine-grained annotations. \n\nTo complement this, the paper presents LEGION, a multimodal large language model-based image forgery analysis framework that integrates artifact detection, segmentation, and explanation. Moreover, it uses LEGION as a controller, integrating it into image refinement pipelines to guide the generation of higher-quality and more realistic images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LEGION outperforms existing methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.
