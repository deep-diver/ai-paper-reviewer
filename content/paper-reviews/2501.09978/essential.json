Existing text-driven editing techniques often lack the ability to handle these complex scenarios effectively, leading to artifacts and inconsistencies in the final output.  The paper tackles the challenges of editing animatable 3D Gaussian head avatars, which are particularly complex due to the inherent difficulty of addressing occlusions and maintaining consistency across various frames of an animation. \nThis paper introduces GaussianAvatar-Editor, a novel framework that addresses these issues. It uses a Weighted Alpha Blending Equation (WABE) to enhance the blending of visible Gaussians while suppressing the influence of those that are occluded.  Furthermore, it incorporates conditional adversarial learning to refine the edited results and maintain consistency across different time steps and perspectives. The proposed method achieves high-quality, photorealistic editing results, demonstrating superiority over existing approaches in handling complex animation challenges and significantly enhancing the realism of the final avatar rendering.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.09978/podcast.wav"}
