Existing methods rely on token-by-token predictions, leading to inefficiency and restricted user control. Therefore, there is a need for faster methods with better user control.\n\nThis paper introduces MeshCraft, a novel framework for efficient and controllable mesh generation, leveraging continuous spatial diffusion to generate triangle faces. MeshCraft uses a transformer-based VAE and a flow-based diffusion transformer conditioned on the number of faces. This method demonstrates superior speed and controllability, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the ShapeNet dataset and superior performance on the Objaverse dataset.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.23022/podcast.wav"}
