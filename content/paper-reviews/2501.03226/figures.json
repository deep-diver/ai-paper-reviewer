The x-axis represents different benchmarks (MATH, AMC10, AMC12, AQUA, MathBench-C, MathBench-H, MathVerse, OlympiadBench, and MathVision), and the y-axis represents the accuracy.  The radar chart compares the performance of three methods: 0-shot, few-shot in-context learning (COT), and the proposed BoostStep method. The BoostStep approach consistently outperforms the other two methods across all benchmarks. Notably, on benchmarks with lower similarity to the training data (OlympiadBench and MathVision), the BoostStep method shows significant improvement over few-shot COT, which even demonstrates a negative impact in those cases.  This highlights BoostStep's robustness and effectiveness, especially when dealing with less similar problems. The BoostStep method's improvement averages about 4% across all benchmarks.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.03226/extracted/6113775/figs/method.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Our strategy refines in-context learning from problem-level granularity (fig.a) to step-level granularity(fig.b) to provide more real-time fine-grained guidance.

Panel (a) shows traditional problem-level in-context learning, where the model receives a set of complete example problems before attempting to solve a new problem. This approach offers limited guidance during the reasoning process. Panel (b) presents BoostStep's step-level in-context learning, which provides more granular guidance by retrieving examples for each individual reasoning step.  The 'first-try' strategy, where the model attempts the step before retrieving examples, ensures higher relevance. Panel (c) demonstrates how BoostStep integrates with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), guiding both the candidate generation and decision-making processes by introducing highly relevant example steps.", "section": "3 Step-Level In-Context Learning"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.03226/extracted/6113775/figs/example.png", "caption": "Figure 3: An example of different problems may contain similar steps.

It shows two distinct math problems with different surface-level features.  Problem-level methods would deem these problems dissimilar due to their contextual differences and might not find them relevant to each other.  However, BoostStep focuses on the underlying steps involved in solving the problem and highlights that both problems share a similar 'core skill' or reasoning step (e.g., squaring an expression of the form (x + 1/x) to solve for a polynomial). Step-level learning allows retrieval and use of this highly relevant guidance (the core skill), improving the model's ability to solve problems with similar underlying steps, even if their overall problem statements differ.", "section": "3 Step-Level In-Context Learning"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.03226/extracted/6113775/figs/case.png", "caption": "Figure 4: A specific example of adjusting reasoning during real-time inference through step-level in-context learning.

The example shows the model's initial attempt ('first-try') at solving a step in a mathematical problem, where it incorrectly uses an equation.  The step-level in-context learning then retrieves a relevant example from a database, guiding the model to utilize the correct equation and arrive at the correct solution for that step. This highlights the method's ability to provide targeted guidance and correct errors in the model's reasoning.", "section": "3.4 Step-Level Example Guidance in MCTS"}]
