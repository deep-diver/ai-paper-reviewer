The planning module generates a planning graph that outlines the logic of a query. This graph guides the reasoning module, which employs mixed traversal by interweaving structural traversal (following the relationships in the knowledge base) and textual matching (comparing text content with the query) to identify candidate answers. Finally, the organizing module reranks the retrieved candidates, prioritizing those that align best with the query's logical structure based on their traversal trajectories.", "section": "3 Framework"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.20317/extracted/6244716/figures/query-pattern-20250215.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Imbalance number of queries and performance of different retrievers across different logical structures.", "description": "This figure displays a bar chart showing the performance of three different retrieval methods (Textual Retriever, Structural Retriever, and Mixture-of-Retrievers) across various logical structures found within the Amazon dataset.
