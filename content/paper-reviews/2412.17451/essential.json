Self-evolving training, where models learn from their own outputs, presents a promising solution, but its application in the multimodal domain has been limited. This paper addresses this gap by systematically investigating self-evolving training for multimodal reasoning.  This includes exploring different training methods, reward models, and prompt variations, highlighting key factors influencing training effectiveness.\nThe researchers propose M-STAR, a novel framework that incorporates the best practices discovered during this systematic investigation.  M-STAR demonstrates a significant improvement in multimodal reasoning abilities across various benchmarks and different model sizes. Notably, it achieves these advancements without human annotation, thus addressing the scarcity of annotated data.  The study also reveals important insights into the dynamics of self-evolving training and introduces techniques for optimizing model exploration and exploitation.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2412.17451/podcast.wav"}
