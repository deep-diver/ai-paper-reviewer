This paper addresses this gap by proposing a novel approach to scale flow models effectively. Traditional flow models rely on deterministic processes, limiting their ability to incorporate particle sampling, a key technique for enhancing sample quality during inference. This limitation hinders their ability to effectively align outputs with user preferences or other reward signals, making them less adaptable compared to diffusion models in certain applications.\n\nTo solve this, the paper introduces three key innovations: (1) SDE-based generation to enable particle sampling in flow models, (2) Interpolant conversion, using Variance Preserving (VP) to broaden the search space and enhance sample diversity, and (3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), which adaptively allocates computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Results show SDE-based generation and VP interpolant improve particle sampling in flow models. Furthermore, RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming previous inference-time scaling approaches, and better align images with complex user prompts.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.19385/podcast.wav"}
