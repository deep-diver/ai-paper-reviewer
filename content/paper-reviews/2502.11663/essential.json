These models, which rely on video prediction, are limited in complex scenarios like weather changes and scene variations. To tackle these issues, a new model design is needed, that combines generation loss with feature-level context learning to improve fidelity, generalizability, and long-time series prediction.\n\nThis paper introduces **MaskGWM, a Generalizable driving World Model** that utilizes video mask reconstruction. It employs a Diffusion Transformer structure trained with extra mask construction, diffusion-related mask tokens, and extends mask construction to spatial-temporal domains using row-wise masking. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets confirm that **MaskGWM** significantly improves upon existing driving world models, demonstrating enhanced video quality, zero-shot performance, and long-term prediction.", "affiliation": "SenseTime Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.11663/podcast.wav"}
