### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

AI is increasingly used to control robots, learning from human demonstrations. **Diffusion Policies**, a cutting-edge method, enable robots to learn complex, versatile behaviors. However, these models can become computationally expensive, limiting their real-world use, especially for robots with limited processing power. This poses a challenge for researchers seeking to deploy these advanced AI models on real-world robotic systems.

To overcome this obstacle, the researchers introduced **MoDE (Mixture-of-Denoising Experts)**, a new type of Diffusion Policy.  MoDE uses a clever trick: it only activates parts of the model relevant to the robot's current situation, making the process much more efficient.  It routes tokens based on the noise levels, which also enables smart caching, cutting down processing time even further. Tests showed MoDE outperforms current top methods while using less computational resources and even achieving state-of-the-art performance in complex, multi-step tasks, showcasing the power of this efficient design.

### In-depth insights


#### Scaling Diffusion Policies
**Scaling diffusion policies** involves increasing model size and data to handle complex behaviors.  This poses a **computational challenge** due to larger models and numerous denoising steps.  **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** offers a promising solution by activating only a subset of parameters during each forward pass.  Noise-conditioned routing allows specialized experts for different denoising phases. Combining noise-conditioned self-attention further improves efficiency.  This enables **scaling model capacity while reducing computational costs**, which is crucial for real-time robotics applications.

#### MoDE Architecture
The MoDE architecture presented leverages a Mixture of Denoising Experts (MoE) within a transformer framework for diffusion-based policies.  A **key innovation** is the **noise-conditioned routing**, where expert selection depends on the noise level during the denoising process. This specialization allows experts to focus on specific denoising phases and enables efficient **expert caching**, reducing computational overhead during inference. The design incorporates **noise-conditioned self-attention**  and noise input tokens for enhanced noise injection. These elements together enable MoDE to efficiently scale to larger model capacities while maintaining a smaller active parameter footprint. Notably, the architecture facilitates a flexible utilization of experts, allowing the model to dynamically adapt to the denoising requirements at different noise levels.

#### Noise-Conditioned Routing
**Noise-conditioned routing** presents a novel approach in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, where the routing of input tokens to expert networks is determined by the noise level in the data. This strategy proves particularly advantageous in Diffusion Policies, which are increasingly used for tasks like imitation learning in robotics.  Traditional MoE routing often relies on input content, while noise-conditioned routing allows for specialization of experts across different denoising phases in diffusion models. This specialization is crucial for efficient handling of the varying levels of noise present during the denoising process. It enables **improved performance and computational efficiency**, as experts can be pre-computed and cached based on noise level. This reduces computational overhead during inference. Furthermore, this routing method leads to **better scaling and generalization** compared to standard MoE approaches by allowing experts to focus on specific noise regimes rather than the entire data distribution.

#### Multitask Efficiency
**MoDE**, a Mixture-of-Denoising-Experts policy, exhibits remarkable multitask efficiency in imitation learning.  Its **noise-conditioned routing** mechanism activates specific expert denoisers based on the noise level, enabling **sparse parameter usage and expert caching**. This significantly reduces computational costs, achieving up to **90% fewer FLOPs and faster inference** compared to dense transformer models.  Evaluations across diverse benchmarks like CALVIN and LIBERO show MoDE's superior performance on a wide range of tasks, confirming its potential for efficient and scalable multitask learning.

#### Expert Utilization Analysis
**MoDE's noise-conditioned routing** enables dynamic expert allocation during action denoising.  Visualizations reveal specialized expert roles across noise levels.  Early layers differentiate strongly between high and low noise, while middle layers exhibit more distributed utilization, suggesting a transition from coarse to fine action refinement.  Later layers show a return to specialization, indicating a focus on final action adjustments.  The first layer prioritizes low-noise scenarios. Notably, different experts handle distinct noise ranges.  Some specialize in initial high-noise denoising, others in low-noise refinement, and some in transitional phases.  **This division of labor** across noise levels, without explicit supervision, highlights the effectiveness of noise-conditioned routing for enabling specialized denoising expertise within MoDE's architecture.

> üîº MoDE's router pre-computes expert utilization at each noise level before inference. This allows fusing selected expert MLPs into a single, composite MLP, enhancing efficiency by eliminating per-step expert invocation and streamlining memory access.  The figure illustrates how the router activates different experts based on the noise level during the denoising process. At high noise levels, different experts are used than at lower noise levels. Caching eliminates the need for the router after training. This process significantly reduces the FLOPs overhead by over 80% and speeds up inference by a factor of two compared to standard Mixture of Experts.

> üîº This figure compares the computational efficiency of MoDE against a dense transformer baseline with a similar number of parameters. The left plot shows that MoDE with caching significantly improves inference speed, especially at larger batch sizes. At batch size 1, MoDE is only slightly faster (12ms vs 15ms). However, at batch size 512, MoDE achieves nearly 40% faster inference (64ms vs 104ms). The right plot demonstrates the substantial reduction in FLOPs achieved by MoDE, particularly with router caching enabled. At batch size 1, the difference is marginal. However, at batch size 512, MoDE requires 16x fewer FLOPs (361 vs 5,772 GFLOPs) due to its sparse architecture and caching mechanism. These results highlight the superior computational efficiency of MoDE in terms of both inference speed and FLOP count.

> üîº This figure visualizes how a Mixture-of-Denoising-Experts (MoDE) model distributes its workload across different expert modules during the denoising process of generating actions. Each small heatmap represents a layer in the MoDE architecture, and the horizontal axis represents the different expert modules within that layer. The vertical axis shows the denoising steps, progressing from high noise levels at the top to low noise levels at the bottom. The color intensity within each cell indicates the proportion of tokens (parts of the input data) that the corresponding expert processes at a given denoising step. Darker yellow colors signify higher utilization of an expert, while darker purple colors indicate lower usage. The figure shows how different experts specialize in different phases of the denoising process, with some experts handling high-noise inputs and others focusing on refining low-noise outputs.

> üîº Figure 8, located in the 'Evaluation' section (specifically subsection 4.5.4: 'How does the model scale with more experts?'), presents the performance of MoDE and its dense variants (Dense-small and Dense-large) on two CALVIN benchmark challenges: ABC and ABCD. The x-axis represents the number of experts used in the MoDE architecture, ranging from 2 to 8. The y-axis represents the performance, measured as the average rollout length achieved by the policy.  Higher average rollout lengths indicate better performance, as the robot successfully completes more tasks within a given instruction sequence. Two variants of dense MoDE baselines are included for comparison. Dense-small has the same latent dimensionality as MoDE, while Dense-large is scaled to match MoDE's overall parameter count (2048 dimensions). The graph demonstrates how increasing the number of experts in MoDE initially improves performance, peaking at 4 experts for both ABC and ABCD. However, further increasing the number of experts leads to a decrease in performance, potentially due to overfitting or increased routing complexity.  The consistent underperformance of the Dense-small variant across both tasks highlights the parameter efficiency of the MoE architecture in MoDE.

Each subplot corresponds to a layer, with experts E0-E3 on the horizontal axis and the log-scaled token count on the vertical axis. The color gradient represents the proportion of tokens routed to each expert; darker colors indicate higher usage. The figure reveals that the experts specialize in handling different noise levels. High-noise regimes (œÉ1-œÉ7) and low-noise regimes (œÉ8-œÉ10) are handled by different experts, with some experts focusing on initial denoising and others on final refinement. The first layer (L0) exhibits a strong preference for the final denoising steps at low noise levels. Certain layers, especially L4 and L5, clearly demarcate high-noise and low-noise handling experts, showcasing the transition point at around œÉ8. Smooth transitions in expert activations across noise levels are seen, like in L7, demonstrating smooth hand-offs between experts in denoising phases. Overall, the figure elucidates the noise-level specialization and coordinated behavior among experts within the MoE architecture during the denoising process.
