{"importance": "**SURVEYX** automates academic survey generation, enhancing content and citation quality, offering a new approach to tackle information overload and boost research efficiency. This research is relevant to automate literature review and improve academic productivity.", "summary": "SURVEYX automates academic survey generation, enhancing content and citation quality.", "takeaways": ["SURVEYX enhances content quality by 0.259 over existing systems.", "SURVEYX improves citation quality by 1.76.", "SURVEYX approaches human expert performance across multiple evaluation dimensions."], "tldr": "**Automated survey generation** is challenging due to the need for comprehensive, up-to-date references and standardized evaluation metrics. Existing methods suffer from limitations in retrieval, reference pre-processing, and expressive diversity, hindering their applicability in large-scale academic settings. Thus, there is a need to develop efficient systems for automated survey generation.\n\nThis paper introduces **SURVEYX**, a system that divides the survey composing process into Preparation and Generation phases. By introducing online reference retrieval, AttributeTree, and a re-polishing process, **SURVEYX enhances survey composition efficacy**. The system outperforms existing methods in content and citation quality.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14776/podcast.wav"}
