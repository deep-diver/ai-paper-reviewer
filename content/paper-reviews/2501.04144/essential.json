Existing approaches often struggle with generating high-fidelity 3D models from 2D data, especially for complex objects like birds, hindering progress in fields like virtual and augmented reality, and 3D asset creation. This paper presents the challenges of existing methods, and the limitations faced in fine-grained 3D generation.\nThis research introduces Chirpy3D, a novel framework that addresses these challenges. Chirpy3D leverages multi-view diffusion models to integrate fine-grained 2D image understanding into 3D space.  It models parts using continuous latent distributions, allowing for the generation of entirely new, yet plausible parts. A self-supervised loss further enhances the visual coherency of generated objects. The result is a system that produces high-quality 3D models that surpass the limitations of previous methods, offering unprecedented levels of creative control and intricate detail.
