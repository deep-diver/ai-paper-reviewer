{"importance": "This paper introduces a novel atlas and charting method for Hugging Face models, revealing hidden model relationships and improving attribute prediction. This work provides insights that can **help researchers better navigate and utilize the growing number of available models**, optimize resource allocation, and explore novel model training paradigms.", "summary": "Navigating millions of models is hard. This paper charts Hugging Face, revealing model relationships and attribute predictions.", "takeaways": ["The atlas of Hugging Face reveals complex relationships between models, including the prevalence of different training techniques and the impact of model merging.", "Atlas structure can be used to predict model attributes such as accuracy and license, improving model selection and utilization.", "A new charting method is proposed that leverages real-world patterns in model repositories to accurately map model relationships, even in the presence of incomplete documentation."], "tldr": "As the number of publicly available models grows, navigating and analyzing these repositories becomes increasingly challenging. Existing model documentation is often incomplete. This limitation hinders the discovery of valuable models and the understanding of the machine learning landscape. To address these issues, this work focuses on charting a preliminary atlas of models within the Hugging Face repository. Visualizations reveal intricate structures and trends in the relationships between these models. \n\nTo address the challenge, the paper introduces a novel atlas charting method that identifies and leverages common patterns in model repositories. This enables accurate mapping of previously undocumented regions. The paper makes its dataset, code, and interactive atlas publicly available. **This enables trend analysis, measuring model impact, predicting model attributes, and recovering the lineage of models in large repositories.** The results demonstrate significant improvements in atlas structure recovery and attribute prediction, paving the way for more effective model discovery and utilization.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10633/podcast.wav"}
