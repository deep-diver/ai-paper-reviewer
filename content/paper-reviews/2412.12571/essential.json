Existing solutions, like adapters or unified models, haven't fully cracked the code for stable, general-purpose zero-shot generation and often falter with unseen tasks. These approaches also often underutilize the wealth of publicly available task-agnostic data.\nThis paper introduces ChatDiT, a novel framework leveraging the inherent zero-shot capabilities of pre-trained diffusion transformers (DiTs).  It requires no additional training or modifications. Instead, it uses a clever multi-agent system:  an Instruction-Parsing agent to understand user instructions and images, a Strategy-Planning agent to devise generation steps, and an Execution agent to perform actions using a toolkit of DiTs. This enables users to interact with the system via natural language for tasks ranging from image edits to multi-page illustrations. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench reveals ChatDiT outperforms existing models in zero-shot generation, showcasing DiTs' potential.", "affiliation": "Tongyi Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.12571/podcast.wav"}
