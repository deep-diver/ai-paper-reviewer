The baselines include SAM2, a popular semantic segmentation model, tested in three configurations: (1) original SAM2; (2) SAM2 fine-tuned on the PartGen dataset; and (3) SAM2 fine-tuned for multi-view segmentation. PartGen's performance is evaluated using three different sampling counts (1, 5, and 10), showing how performance improves with more samples, reflecting the stochastic nature of the approach.  The evaluation metrics are mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 50% and 75%, indicating the accuracy of part segmentation in terms of overlap with ground truth.  The results demonstrate that PartGen significantly outperforms the SAM2 baselines.", "section": "4.
