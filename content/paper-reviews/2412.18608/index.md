### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current text-to-3D and image-to-3D models produce high-quality 3D assets, but these assets typically lack internal structure and are represented as single, fused objects. This limits their use in applications requiring manipulation of individual parts, such as video games or robotics.  **Existing methods struggle with automatically segmenting 3D objects into meaningful parts and completing occluded parts.**



PartGen solves this by employing a novel multi-view diffusion model approach.  **It first identifies plausible parts by segmenting multi-view images of 3D objects.**  A second diffusion model then completes the partially visible or occluded parts, accounting for their context within the whole object. This enables accurate 3D reconstruction of each part.  **The process allows for the generation of multiple plausible segmentations and the completion of entire invisible parts.** The method also enables 3D part editing based on text instructions, improving control in 3D object creation. The superior performance is demonstrated on a large dataset of 3D objects and various applications.

> üîº PartGen is a system for creating compositional 3D objects.  It starts with text, an image, or a pre-existing 3D model.  A multi-view diffusion model automatically identifies and segments the object into its constituent parts. A second diffusion model then completes and reconstructs each part in 3D, considering the context of the other parts for accurate assembly.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-view Diffusion
Multi-view diffusion models represent a significant advancement in 3D object generation and reconstruction. By leveraging multiple 2D views of an object, these models overcome limitations inherent in single-view approaches.  The use of diffusion models enables the generation of plausible and view-consistent part segmentations, accurately capturing the object's composition.  This is particularly crucial when parts of the object are occluded in some views. **The multi-view nature ensures the parts generated are not only individually realistic but also seamlessly integrate within the full 3D model.**  Furthermore, **the generative aspect of the approach allows for the completion of occluded parts, even hallucinating entirely missing pieces based on context.** This capability greatly improves the quality of 3D reconstructions compared to traditional methods that struggle with missing information. **The combination of multi-view consistency, completion, and diffusion models creates a powerful pipeline for various applications**, such as part editing, and offers a significant step towards generating truly realistic and usable 3D assets from various input modalities.

#### Part Segmentation
The core challenge of Part Segmentation in 3D object processing lies in the inherent ambiguity of defining parts.  **PartGen cleverly addresses this by framing the problem as a multi-view consistent colorization task**. This shifts the focus from precise, deterministic boundaries to a probabilistic representation of plausible part distributions, aligning with the variability inherent in artistic interpretations.  Instead of relying on a single, predefined segmentation, **PartGen utilizes a diffusion model to generate multiple possible segmentations**, thus capturing the nuanced ambiguity that would be missed by a purely deterministic approach.  This generative approach allows for more flexible and context-aware segmentations, considering not just the object's visible surface but also occluded regions.  The use of a multi-view framework is crucial, allowing the model to learn relationships between views and produce more consistent and reliable part boundaries, even in challenging cases with occlusions. Overall, PartGen's approach to Part Segmentation is innovative in its handling of ambiguity, leveraging the power of generative models to produce realistic and diverse results.

#### 3D Part Completion
The core challenge of 3D part completion lies in reconstructing 3D shapes from incomplete or occluded views.  The paper cleverly addresses this by using a multi-view diffusion model, **not just to segment parts, but also to complete and generate missing views**. This is crucial because directly reconstructing a partially visible part with a standard 3D reconstruction network often fails. The multi-view approach considers contextual information from the entire object, ensuring that completed parts integrate seamlessly.  This **generative completion** is key to handling heavily occluded or even entirely invisible parts, going beyond simple inpainting.  The model's ability to "hallucinate" missing information based on context shows a sophisticated understanding of object composition. This novel approach surpasses standard 3D reconstruction methods and is demonstrated by empirical results showing improved reconstruction quality and coherence.

#### Compositional Gen
A hypothetical section titled "Compositional Gen" within a research paper on 3D generation would likely explore methods for creating complex 3D objects by assembling simpler, meaningful parts.  This contrasts with monolithic generation approaches that produce a single, fused 3D model lacking inherent structure.  **Key aspects** would include techniques for **part segmentation** (identifying individual components from a complete object), **part completion** (generating missing or occluded portions of parts), and **part assembly** (combining individual parts into a coherent whole).  The research might investigate different representation methods for parts, such as implicit neural fields or meshes, and explore how context and relationships between parts influence the final object's appearance.  **Advanced techniques** could involve generative models capable of learning and modeling the distribution of plausible part compositions, enabling diverse outputs similar to those of human artists. The section would likely emphasize the benefits of compositional generation for downstream tasks like **3D editing and manipulation**, where individual parts can be modified independently, offering increased flexibility and control over the final product.  Evaluation would focus on assessing the accuracy and realism of generated parts, as well as the overall coherence and quality of the assembled 3D objects.

#### PartGen Limits
PartGen, while innovative, faces limitations stemming from its reliance on a curated dataset of artist-created 3D assets.  This introduces **inherent biases** that may affect generated outputs and raise ethical concerns regarding cultural representation.  The model's capacity is currently limited to objects with fewer than 10 parts, potentially hindering its effectiveness in more complex scenarios.  **Highly intricate scenes**, like those with dense foliage, may result in inaccuracies during depth map generation, impacting reconstruction quality.  The approach primarily focuses on object-level generation, neglecting scene-level applications, which represent a significant area for future expansion.  Addressing these limitations, especially the data bias and scalability challenges, will be crucial for PartGen's wider applicability and reliability.

> üîº PartGen starts with text, an image, or a 3D model as input.  It first generates a multi-view grid image of the object. A diffusion-based segmentation network then identifies the object's constituent parts, ensuring consistency across multiple views. Each segmented part, along with its context within the entire object, is fed into a multi-view part completion network. This network completes each part's view, handling occlusions and generating missing information. Finally, a pre-trained 3D reconstruction model uses these completed views to generate the final 3D parts that make up the object.
