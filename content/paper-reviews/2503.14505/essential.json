{"importance": "This paper introduces MusicInfuser, a method to generate synchronized dance videos, offering a promising direction for AI-driven content creation. **It leverages existing diffusion models, enhancing their capabilities without extensive retraining**, and opens avenues for further exploration in AI-assisted choreography.", "summary": "Sync your moves! MusicInfuser adapts video diffusion to make models listen and dance to music, preserving style and aligning movement.", "takeaways": ["MusicInfuser adapts pre-trained text-to-video models to generate dance videos synchronized to music.", "The method uses music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter and only fine-tunes on dance videos.", "An evaluation framework using Video-LLMs assesses dance generation quality."], "tldr": "Generating synchronized video and audio has been a difficult task, requiring larger and more complex models. The generation of dance movements from music is challenging due to the need to simultaneously consider multiple aspects, like style and beat. Current methods depend on motion capture data which is resource-intensive. To resolve this, the paper introduces MusicInfuser.\n\nMusicInfuser adapts pre-trained text-to-video models to condition on music tracks using music-video cross-attention and a low-rank adapter. This method generates videos synchronized with the input music, with styles and appearances controllable via text prompts. MusicInfuser preserves the rich knowledge in the text modality, enabling various forms of control, while also introducing an evaluation framework using Video-LLMs.", "affiliation": "University of Washington", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.14505/podcast.wav"}
