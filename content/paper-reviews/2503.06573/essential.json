{"importance": "This paper introduces **WILDIFEVAL**, a unique dataset with 12K real user instructions under multi-constraint to benchmark the abilities of instruction-following LLMs. WILDIFEVAL, aims to reflect a realistic and contemporary view of constrained generation user requests, serves as a playground for fine-grained analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of models, drilling down beyond the task level into atomic user constraints, can help focus model improvement efforts.", "summary": "WILDIFEVAL: Instruction Following in the Wild.", "takeaways": ["Current LLMs still struggle with multi-constraint instructions, showing performance degradation as the number of constraints increases.", "The specific type of constraint significantly impacts model performance, with length-related constraints proving particularly challenging.", "The WILDIFEVAL dataset offers a valuable resource for future research on improving instruction-following capabilities in complex, realistic scenarios."], "tldr": "Recent advances in LLMs show remarkable success in following instructions, but handling those with multiple constraints remains a challenge. Existing works evaluating the ability of LLMs follow a bottom-up approach, starting from curated verifiable constraints. To evaluate the abilities of LLMs to follow real-world instructions, this paper introduces a large-scale dataset of real user instructions under diverse conditions.\n\nThis paper introduces **WILDIFEVAL**, a dataset of 12K real user instructions. It analyzes different types of user tasks and constraints to provide an insight into real-world generation use cases. The paper compares the performance of various LLMs and analyzes the impact of the number and type of constraints on model performance. Releasing WILDIFEVAL provides the first comprehensive analysis of the types and properties of constraints appearing in real-world user instructions.", "affiliation": "Hebrew University of Jerusalem", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.06573/podcast.wav"}
