### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Recent advances in LLMs show remarkable success in following instructions, but handling those with multiple constraints remains a challenge. Existing works evaluating the ability of LLMs follow a bottom-up approach, starting from curated verifiable constraints. To evaluate the abilities of LLMs to follow real-world instructions, this paper introduces a large-scale dataset of real user instructions under diverse conditions.



This paper introduces **WILDIFEVAL**, a dataset of 12K real user instructions. It analyzes different types of user tasks and constraints to provide an insight into real-world generation use cases. The paper compares the performance of various LLMs and analyzes the impact of the number and type of constraints on model performance. Releasing WILDIFEVAL provides the first comprehensive analysis of the types and properties of constraints appearing in real-world user instructions.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-Constraint
**Multi-constraint** scenarios in research highlight the complexities of real-world problems. **Balancing multiple objectives** and limitations requires sophisticated approaches. Traditional methods often struggle, leading to suboptimal solutions. **AI and optimization techniques** offer promising tools for addressing these challenges. Effective strategies involve **prioritization**, **trade-off analysis**, and **robustness evaluation**. Future research should focus on **scalable algorithms** and **adaptive constraint handling** to improve decision-making.

#### Dataset: WILDIFE
The WILDIFEVAL dataset is introduced as a **large-scale resource** for evaluating LLMs on multi-constraint instructions. Comprising 12K real-world user instructions, it aims to tackle the challenge of LLMs struggling with complex constraints. Unlike existing datasets, WILDIFEVAL captures a broad lexical and topical range of constraints found in natural user prompts, categorized into eight high-level classes. The dataset enables a **fine-grained analysis** of LLM performance, breaking down tasks into individual constraints for evaluation. Its release promotes research on instruction-following under complex, realistic conditions and fills a gap in realistic and diverse instructions.

#### Constraint Types
Constraint types in generation tasks are diverse, ranging from **explicit content rules** (**include/avoid**) to **nuanced stylistic** and **quality directives**. Taxonomies often lack unification, needing bridging with **data-driven insights**. Analyzing frequent words helps uncover patterns and refine categories, revealing overlooked types. **Persona/role** and **style/tone** significantly shape the output's narrative voice.

#### LLM Benchmarking
**LLM benchmarking** is vital for assessing model capabilities. The paper uses WILDIFEVAL to **evaluate** LLMs, focusing on instruction-following in complex scenarios. The method **measures** the fraction of fulfilled constraints. The paper evaluates 14 LLMs. Results show that **larger models generally perform better**, but all models struggle with multiple constraints, especially those related to length. Specific constraint types influence model rankings.

#### Atomic Analysis
**Atomic analysis** in the context of LLMs instruction following could refer to a **granular, component-level investigation** of model behavior. It entails breaking down complex instructions into **individual constraints or sub-tasks** and evaluating the model's success in fulfilling each one. This allows for identifying **specific strengths and weaknesses**, pinpointing which types of constraints models handle well and where they struggle. By focusing on these **atomic elements**, researchers can gain **deeper insights into the model's decision-making process**, leading to more targeted improvements in instruction following capabilities and a better understanding of the relationship between instruction components and model performance.

Panel (a) presents a bar chart illustrating the distribution of various constraint types, showing their relative frequencies.  Panel (b) shows a t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) projection of constraint embeddings, where each point represents a constraint and is colored according to its type.  The t-SNE visualization reveals clustering patterns: constraints related to 'Format and Structure', 'Length', and 'Style and Tone' form distinct clusters, while 'Focus/Emphasis' and 'Include/Avoid' constraints are more dispersed. This suggests that the former group possesses a more inherent, generic nature than the latter content-oriented group.
