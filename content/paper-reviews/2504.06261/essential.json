Inference, a parallel LLM inference engine, improves reasoning speed by leveraging concurrent attention and shared memory."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often require extensive computation for complex tasks, leading to long inference times. Current methods for parallel LLM operation involve pre-defined frameworks that can hinder flexibility and applicability. The paper addresses these limitations by proposing a novel approach. This method allows LLMs to synchronize via a concurrently-updated attention cache, enabling dynamic collaboration and adaptation to the task at hand. \n\nThe paper introduces **Hogwild! Inference**, a parallel LLM inference engine where multiple instances of the same LLM run concurrently with a shared attention cache. This enables real-time access to each other's generated tokens. By leveraging Rotary Position Embeddings (ROPE), the engine avoids recomputation while improving hardware utilization. The study demonstrates that modern reasoning-capable LLMs can perform inference with a shared Key-Value cache effectively.", "affiliation": "Yandex", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.06261/podcast.wav"}
