Early automatic methods optimize prompts or hyperparameters but still rely on fixed workflows, requiring human effort for each scenario. Graph-based methods automate workflow designs but face scalability limits. State-of-the-art methods use programming codes and prompt performant LLMs as meta-agents, but they generate single task-specific systems lacking adaptability for individual user queries. \n\nThis paper proposes **FlowReasoner**, a query-level meta-agent that automates the design of query-specific multi-agent systems. It incentivizes a reasoning-based meta-agent via external execution feedback. By distilling DeepSeek R1, FlowReasoner gains reasoning ability and is enhanced via reinforcement learning (RL). A multi-purpose reward guides RL training, considering performance, complexity, and efficiency. Experiments demonstrate FlowReasoner's superiority on engineering and competition code benchmarks.
