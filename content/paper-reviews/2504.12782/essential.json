{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it **offers a novel approach to concept erasure** in text-to-image models, improving both safety and quality. The **ANT framework** provides a practical solution to a critical problem, with broad implications for the responsible deployment of generative AI. It also opens **new avenues for research** in controllable content generation.", "summary": "ANT: Automatically steers denoising trajectories to sidestep unwanted concepts in text-to-image generation, ensuring safer, high-quality outputs!", "takeaways": ["Reversing classifier-free guidance in mid-to-late denoising enables precise content modification.", "Trajectory-aware finetuning preserves early-stage score function integrity, improving concept erasure.", "Augmentation-enhanced weight saliency maps accurately identify key parameters for concept erasure."], "tldr": "Text-to-image models often generate harmful content. Existing finetuning-based methods suffer from limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting trajectories, causing visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on heuristic selection of anchor concepts. There is a need for a solution that preserves structural integrity and avoids heuristic selection to improve quality and safety in image generation.\n\nTo address the issues, this paper introduces a finetuning framework called ANT. ANT steers deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. The approach reverses the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising, enabling precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. It also introduces a trajectory-aware objective and an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map for single-concept erasure.", "affiliation": "Nanyang Technological University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.12782/podcast.wav"}
