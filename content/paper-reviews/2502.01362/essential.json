Existing acceleration methods are limited, often applying only to specific DBM types or falling short in achieving single-step generation.  This creates a need for a universal and efficient acceleration technique.\n\nThis paper introduces Inverse Bridge Matching Distillation (IBMD), a new method that addresses these limitations.  IBMD offers a universal approach, working with both conditional and unconditional DBMs.  It allows for distillation into single-step generators and doesn't require target domain data.  Evaluations across numerous tasks show that IBMD significantly speeds up DBMs inference (4x to 100x) and can even improve generation quality compared to the original models.", "affiliation": "Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.01362/podcast.wav"}
