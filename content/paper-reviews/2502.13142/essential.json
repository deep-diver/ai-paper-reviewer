Existing approaches either rely on limited robotic datasets or struggle to transfer knowledge effectively from other domains, like human video.  This limits the development of robots capable of generalizing well to various tasks and environments.\n\nThis paper introduces ARM4R, a novel approach that leverages low-level 4D representations learned from readily available human video data.  **ARM4R uses 3D point tracking to create these representations, transferring knowledge efficiently to robotic control tasks**. The model is trained in three stages: pre-training on human videos, fine-tuning on robotic data, and final fine-tuning for specific control tasks.  **Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ARM4R, exceeding performance of existing methods in various simulations and real-world scenarios.**", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2502.13142/podcast.wav"}
