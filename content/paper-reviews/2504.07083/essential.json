{"importance": "This work introduces a new approach to video cinematography, offering researchers new tools for camera control and filmmaking. The **DataDoP dataset** and **GenDoP model** provide a strong foundation for future research in automated video creation. By combining multimodal inputs and directorial intent, this research opens avenues for more expressive and artistic camera movements, impacting areas such as virtual production and creative AI.", "summary": "GenDoP: AI Director of Photography", "takeaways": ["Introduces DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset for free-moving camera trajectories with detailed captions.", "Presents GenDoP, an auto-regressive model for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs.", "Demonstrates that GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability compared to existing methods."], "tldr": "Camera trajectory design is crucial in video production, but existing methods are limited by geometric optimization, handcrafted systems, and structural biases. This paper introduces **DataDoP**, a multi-modal dataset with 29K real-world shots, depth maps, and detailed captions describing camera movements, scene interaction, and directorial intent. The dataset addresses the lack of artistic, expressive, and intentional camera movements in existing resources. It leverages state-of-the-art techniques to extract accurate camera trajectories and scene compositions from real video clips. \n\nTo address these limitations, the paper introduces **GenDoP**, an auto-regressive model that treats camera parameters as discrete tokens. This allows for fine-grained control and stable, complex movements. The model uses a decoder-only Transformer architecture. Multi-modal inputs, including textual descriptions and optional RGBD information, are used to generate camera movements. The experiments showed that GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.07083/podcast.wav"}
