Stage I focuses on generating a diverse set of persuasion tasks, including both ethical and unethical scenarios, using a taxonomy to categorize tasks by harmfulness level. Stage II involves simulating persuasive dialogues using two separate LLMs, one acting as the persuader and the other as the persuadee.  This stage considers the influence of various factors such as personality traits and contextual constraints. Stage III assesses the safety of the model's behavior through checking for the appropriate rejection of unethical tasks, and evaluates any unethical strategies used during the persuasive conversations. The figure uses icons and text to illustrate each stage of the framework.", "section": "3 PERSUSAFETY"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.10430/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Taxonomy of the unethical persuasion strategies studied in our work.", "description": "This figure presents a taxonomy of unethical persuasion strategies.
