This creates a need for domain adaptation techniques, especially considering privacy and real-time monitoring requirements. Existing synthetic data generation methods often fall short in extracting and preserving critical domain knowledge, hindering their effectiveness. \n\nTo tackle this, the authors propose a new framework that generates high-quality synthetic training data for specialized domains, called ELTEX. This framework systematically integrates explicit domain indicator extraction with dynamic prompting, thus preserving critical domain nuances during data generation. The authors demonstrate its effectiveness in the context of blockchain-related cyberattack detection, showing that it can enable smaller models to achieve performance competitive with much larger models. A new synthetic dataset is also released to help spur further research.", "affiliation": "Distributed Networks Institute (DNI)", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15055/podcast.wav"}
