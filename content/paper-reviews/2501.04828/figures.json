The text is presented in two forms: the original Perso-Arabic script and a transliteration using the modern Turkish alphabet.  This demonstrates the challenges involved in processing historical Turkish texts due to the use of a different script and significant differences between the historical and modern forms of the language.", "section": "3.1 HisTR: A Historical Turkish NER Dataset"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.04828/extracted/6119689/images/ottoman_corpus_analysis_3.png", "caption": "Figure 2: CoNLL-U Representation of an example sentence from our OTA-BOUN historical Turkish treebank.", "description": "This figure displays a sample sentence from the OTA-BOUN historical Turkish treebank in the CoNLL-U format.  CoNLL-U (CoNLL Universal) is a standard format for representing linguistic annotations, particularly dependency parsing. The table shows each word (token) of the sentence, its part-of-speech tag (POS), its morphological features, and its dependency relation to other words in the sentence. The first column is the index of the word in the sentence.  The second column provides the word itself written in the Latin alphabet (a transliteration of the original historical Turkish). The third column shows its part-of-speech tag and morphological features. The last column presents the word in the original Perso-Arabic script used in historical Turkish. The dependency relations are shown via the 'HEAD' column, where the index of the head word each word depends on is specified.  This detailed annotation makes this figure a useful example of the rigorous annotation process involved in creating the treebank, illustrating the complexity and detail captured in the historical Turkish dataset.", "section": "3.2 OTA-BOUN: A Universal Dependencies Treebank for Historical Turkish"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.04828/extracted/6119689/deptree_org_sade.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: t-SNE visualization of documents in the Ottoman Text Corpus: Each point represents a document, color-coded by topic. This visualization highlights thematic clusters within the corpus and shows how topics are distributed periodically, complementing the map\u2019s representation of vocabulary diversity and topic.", "description": "This figure uses t-SNE (t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) to visualize the relationships between documents in the Ottoman Text Corpus. Each point represents a single document, and the color of each point indicates its topic.  The clustering of points reveals thematic groups within the corpus.  The distribution of these clusters across time (as shown in the accompanying bar charts) demonstrates how topic prevalence varies across different historical periods. This visualization therefore effectively displays both the topical and temporal diversity of the Ottoman Text Corpus.", "section": "3.3 Ottoman Text Corpus: A Clean Text Corpus of Historical Turkish Documents"}]
