### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Research in computational linguistics has predominantly focused on high-resource languages, neglecting historically significant yet under-resourced languages such as historical Turkish. This has led to a scarcity of annotated datasets and trained models essential for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.  This severely limits the application of advanced NLP techniques to historical Turkish texts.



This paper addresses this gap by introducing the first NER dataset (HisTR), the first Universal Dependencies treebank (OTA-BOUN), and a clean corpus (OTC) of historical Turkish texts, alongside transformer-based models trained on these new resources for NER, dependency parsing, and POS tagging. The study demonstrates significant improvements in the computational analysis of historical Turkish, offering valuable benchmarks and resources for the NLP community while highlighting challenges such as domain adaptation and language variations across time periods. All resources and models are publicly available.

### In-depth insights


#### HisTR NER Dataset
The HisTR NER dataset represents a significant contribution to the field of historical Turkish natural language processing (NLP).  Its creation addresses a critical gap in available resources for this under-resourced language.  **Manually annotated**, HisTR provides a high-quality dataset for training and evaluating named entity recognition (NER) models specifically designed for historical Turkish. The dataset's focus on the Ottoman era, coupled with its inclusion of diverse text types, contributes to its potential for robust model development.  However, **its relatively small size** compared to modern NER datasets could limit the performance of more complex, data-hungry models.  Furthermore, the **annotation process itself**, which involves manually tagging entities such as persons and locations, is labor-intensive and prone to biases. These challenges highlight the need for future research to expand upon HisTR, perhaps with the incorporation of more data or the application of techniques like active learning and data augmentation to maximize its utility for future NLP endeavors.

#### OTA-BOUN Treebank
The creation of the OTA-BOUN treebank represents a significant contribution to the field of historical Turkish NLP.  **Manually annotated**, it offers a crucial resource for syntactic analysis, enabling deeper investigation into historical linguistic structures.  The treebank's inclusion of sentences in both Latin-based and Perso-Arabic scripts adds valuable linguistic diversity. However, its relatively **small size** presents limitations, highlighting the need for more extensive annotation efforts.  The annotation process itself faced challenges due to inconsistencies in historical spelling and the use of archaic terminology, demonstrating the **complexity** of working with such texts.  **The challenges underscore the need for ongoing development and expansion of the treebank** to enhance its value as a benchmark for future NLP research and development in historical Turkish. The availability of this dataset, along with analysis tools and insights into the challenges of annotation, is vital for the advancement of the field.  Its use in benchmarking and training new models is a clear testament to its importance.

#### Historical Turkish NLP
The field of Historical Turkish NLP presents **unique challenges** due to the significant linguistic and orthographic changes the language underwent over centuries.  Unlike modern standardized languages, historical Turkish exhibits substantial variations in vocabulary, grammar, and script (Arabic vs. Latin), making it difficult for standard NLP models to process effectively. **Existing resources are extremely scarce**, and the available data is often noisy and incomplete due to the challenges in digitizing and transcribing historical documents. The research highlights the crucial need for creating specialized datasets and models, focusing on areas like **named entity recognition (NER)**, **dependency parsing**, and **part-of-speech tagging** for historical Turkish texts. This work makes a substantial contribution by introducing novel resources (HisTR, OTA-BOUN, OTC), establishing the baseline for future advancements and providing open-source tools to facilitate this development.

#### Model Fine-tuning
Model fine-tuning in this research paper is a crucial aspect that deserves in-depth analysis.  The authors intelligently leverage pre-trained language models, acknowledging the limitations of training from scratch with limited data.  **The choice to fine-tune existing models is a pragmatic and efficient approach**, allowing them to build upon the substantial knowledge embedded within those models.  The fine-tuning process, applied to various tasks like NER and dependency parsing, showcases the models‚Äô adaptability to the nuances of historical Turkish.  However, the results reveal **the challenges of achieving optimal performance with limited historical data**. While the models demonstrate strong capabilities,  the discrepancy between in-domain and out-of-domain performance underscores the need for more extensive data to improve the generalization of these models. The investigation into the impact of varying training data sizes and combinations highlights the importance of balancing data quantity and quality in fine-tuning. This research **effectively showcases both the potential and limitations of fine-tuning pre-trained models** in a low-resource language setting, offering valuable insights for future work in this field.

#### Future Directions
Future research should prioritize expanding the datasets used in this study.  **Larger, more diverse datasets spanning broader time periods and genres of historical Turkish texts are crucial** for improving the accuracy and robustness of NLP models.  Further investigation into the impact of different pre-training strategies, including multilingual and domain-specific approaches, is needed to **optimize model performance for historical Turkish**. The development of novel techniques to address the specific challenges presented by historical texts, such as noisy OCR data and varying linguistic features, is another key area of focus.  Finally, there's a significant opportunity to **explore the integration of historical Turkish NLP with other digital humanities tools and resources** to facilitate more comprehensive historical research. This interdisciplinary approach could uncover valuable insights into various fields of study, such as history, literature, and linguistics, broadening the reach and impact of this research significantly.

> üîº This figure displays a sample sentence from the OTA-BOUN historical Turkish treebank in the CoNLL-U format.  CoNLL-U (CoNLL Universal) is a standard format for representing linguistic annotations, particularly dependency parsing. The table shows each word (token) of the sentence, its part-of-speech tag (POS), its morphological features, and its dependency relation to other words in the sentence. The first column is the index of the word in the sentence.  The second column provides the word itself written in the Latin alphabet (a transliteration of the original historical Turkish). The third column shows its part-of-speech tag and morphological features. The last column presents the word in the original Perso-Arabic script used in historical Turkish. The dependency relations are shown via the 'HEAD' column, where the index of the head word each word depends on is specified.  This detailed annotation makes this figure a useful example of the rigorous annotation process involved in creating the treebank, illustrating the complexity and detail captured in the historical Turkish dataset.
