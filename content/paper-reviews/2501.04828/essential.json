{"importance": "This paper is crucial because it **addresses the critical lack of resources for processing historical Turkish**, a language with limited digital resources.  It provides valuable datasets and models, opening new avenues for research on low-resource historical language processing and impacting related fields like digital humanities and computational linguistics.", "summary": "First-ever resources (NER dataset, dependency treebank, and corpus) and models for historical Turkish NLP are introduced, significantly advancing research capabilities in this underexplored field.", "takeaways": ["The HisTR NER dataset, OTA-BOUN dependency treebank, and OTC corpus provide foundational resources for historical Turkish NLP.", "Transformer-based models, fine-tuned on these resources, achieve promising results in NER, dependency parsing, and POS tagging for historical Turkish.", "The research highlights the challenges of historical language processing and provides a benchmark for future advancements in the field."], "tldr": "Research in computational linguistics has predominantly focused on high-resource languages, neglecting historically significant yet under-resourced languages such as historical Turkish. This has led to a scarcity of annotated datasets and trained models essential for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.  This severely limits the application of advanced NLP techniques to historical Turkish texts.\n\nThis paper addresses this gap by introducing the first NER dataset (HisTR), the first Universal Dependencies treebank (OTA-BOUN), and a clean corpus (OTC) of historical Turkish texts, alongside transformer-based models trained on these new resources for NER, dependency parsing, and POS tagging. The study demonstrates significant improvements in the computational analysis of historical Turkish, offering valuable benchmarks and resources for the NLP community while highlighting challenges such as domain adaptation and language variations across time periods. All resources and models are publicly available.", "affiliation": "Bo\u011fazi\u00e7i University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Named Entity Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "2501.04828/podcast.wav"}
