Specifically, matching a simulated environment with the real world is difficult and time consuming. Also, the variety of object properties poses challenges in designing generalizable rewards and transferring policies from simulation to reality. Thus, it is hard to scale and generalize via autonomous exploration.\n\nThis work addresses these issues by introducing an automated real-to-sim tuning module to align simulated and real environments, along with a generalized reward design scheme that simplifies reward engineering for long-horizon tasks. To improve sample efficiency, a divide-and-conquer distillation process is employed and a mixture of sparse and dense object representations is adopted to bridge the sim-to-real perception gap. The proposed techniques enable a humanoid robot to perform dexterous manipulation tasks with robust generalization and high performance without human demonstrations.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2502.20396/podcast.wav"}
