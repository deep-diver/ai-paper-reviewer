The taxonomy is structured as a tree, with broader categories branching into more specific subcategories.  It contains a total of 40 leaf nodes (the most granular categories), representing a range of potential safety risks.  The tree includes categories for violent and non-violent crimes, sex-related crimes, suicide and self-harm, and other hazards.  The figure highlights in blue the categories that are new additions or expansions compared to the hazard taxonomy previously developed by MLCommons for Large Language Models.", "section": "3 Creating MSTS"}]
