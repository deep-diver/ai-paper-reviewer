Existing benchmarks highlight the need for enhanced bimanual coordination, precise navigation, and extensive reach. Everyday tasks involve articulated/deformable objects and confined spaces, requiring robots to effectively use their whole bodies. Current systems struggle with data collection, coordinated movements, and real-world complexity. Success requires careful hardware design and effective visuomotor policy learning.\n\nThis paper introduces the Behavior Robot Suite (BRS), a framework for whole-body manipulation in diverse household activities. BRS uses a wheeled, dual-arm robot with a 4-DoF torso, integrating JoyLo (a teleoperation interface) and WB-VIMA (a learning algorithm). JoyLo eases data collection through intuitive control, while WB-VIMA leverages robot's kinematic hierarchy for synchronized movements. BRS excels in navigation, object manipulation, and complex tasks, marking a step toward real-world household assistance.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2503.05652/podcast.wav"}
