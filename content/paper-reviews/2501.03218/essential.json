This leads to delayed responses and reduced responsiveness, particularly problematic in long video streams.  This paper addresses these issues by proposing an alternative architecture.\nDispider, the proposed system, tackles this challenge with a disentangled design. It uses separate, parallel modules for perception (continuous video analysis), decision (determining interaction trigger points), and reaction (generating responses). This asynchronous approach ensures timely, contextually accurate responses without interrupting the continuous video processing.  Experiments show that Dispider significantly outperforms existing models in real-time interactive scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness of its architecture and its improvements in both temporal reasoning and response generation.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.03218/podcast.wav"}
