Our Dispider introduces a disentangled paradigm for active real-time interaction with streaming video. It features a lightweight perception module for continuous monitoring, a decision module to determine when to trigger system interactions, and an asynchronous reaction module for generating detailed responses. In contrast, VideoLLM-online is unable to simultaneously perform streaming perception and response generation because it relies on a single LLM to handle both functions.", "description": "Figure 1 illustrates the architectural differences between Dispider and VideoLLM-online in handling real-time video interactions. Dispider uses a disentangled approach with separate, parallel modules for perception (continuous video monitoring), decision (determining interaction trigger points), and reaction (asynchronous response generation). This allows for simultaneous perception and reaction, unlike VideoLLM-online, which uses a single LLM, resulting in sequential processing and hindering real-time responsiveness.  Dispider's lightweight perception module efficiently processes the video stream, identifying optimal moments for interaction. The decision module integrates interaction history and visual information to trigger the asynchronous interaction module for generating detailed responses, ensuring timely and contextually accurate interactions.", "section": "1. Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.03218/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2:  Illustration of the Response Decision Module in a proactive streaming video processing system. The module dynamically determines when to respond during video streaming by segmenting the video into non-uniform clips and utilizing historical memory to capture context. The module then combines memory features, clip features, question text, and special tokens, \u27e8TODO\u27e9 and \u27e8ANS\u27e9, to decide on response timing.", "description": "The Response Decision Module within Dispider dynamically determines the optimal moments for generating responses to user queries during live video streaming.  It achieves this by first segmenting the continuous video stream into variable-length clips based on scene changes. This ensures that each clip contains meaningful visual information without unnecessary redundancy. The module then leverages a historical memory that incorporates past interactions and visual cues from previously processed video segments. This memory, combined with features extracted from the current video clip, the user's question, and special tokens (\u27e8TODO\u27e9 and \u27e8ANS\u27e9 indicating the need for a decision and the presence of an answer, respectively), informs the model's decision regarding whether to produce a response or wait for additional information.", "section": "3.2.

A question is asked at the very beginning of a video stream.  The figure then shows a timeline of the video, highlighting key moments where either model responded with an answer (text displayed), or remained silent (indicated by silence). The goal is to demonstrate the capabilities of Dispider to provide timely and relevant responses as the video progresses, in contrast to VideoLLM-online.", "section": "4.3.
