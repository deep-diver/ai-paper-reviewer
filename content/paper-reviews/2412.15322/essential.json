{"importance": "This paper is important because it introduces **MMAudio**, a novel approach to video-to-audio synthesis that significantly improves audio quality and synchrony. Its **multimodal joint training framework** and **conditional synchronization module** address limitations of existing methods and opens new avenues for high-quality audio generation with various modalities.", "summary": "MMAudio achieves state-of-the-art video-to-audio synthesis by jointly training on audio-visual and text-audio data, enabling high-quality, semantically and temporally aligned audio generation.", "takeaways": ["MMAudio uses a novel multimodal joint training framework, improving audio quality and synchrony.", "A conditional synchronization module enhances audio-visual alignment at the frame level.", "MMAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in video-to-audio synthesis and competitive results in text-to-audio generation."], "tldr": "Current video-to-audio synthesis methods struggle with generating high-quality, synchronized audio, especially due to limited training data and difficulties in aligning audio with video semantics and timing.  Single-modality approaches relying solely on limited video data, or those finetuning pre-trained models, often fall short in achieving convincing audio-visual synchrony and high-fidelity sound. \nThis paper proposes MMAudio, a novel multimodal joint training approach that tackles these challenges. By jointly training on large-scale, readily available audio-text datasets alongside smaller-scale audio-visual datasets, MMAudio learns to generate high-quality audio semantically aligned with both video and text inputs. A conditional synchronization module further improves the temporal accuracy of audio generation. The results show that MMAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance among public models in audio quality, semantic alignment, and audio-visual synchronization, while maintaining a low inference time.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.15322/podcast.wav"}
