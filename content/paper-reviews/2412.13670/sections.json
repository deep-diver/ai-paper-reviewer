[{"heading_title": "Data Contamination", "details": {"summary": "**Data contamination** significantly impacts LLM evaluation.  Benchmarks, used to assess LLMs, become unreliable when their test data leaks into training sets of newer models, **artificially inflating performance metrics**. This contamination undermines the validity of comparisons and progress tracking.  Publicly available, static benchmarks are particularly susceptible.  As LLMs evolve rapidly, ensuring contamination-free evaluation becomes crucial for **reliable insights** into true capabilities and advancements."}}, {"heading_title": "AntiLeak-Bench", "details": {"summary": "**AntiLeak-Bench** combats data contamination in Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation by creating benchmarks with up-to-date, real-world knowledge.  It addresses the limitations of static benchmarks, whose reuse in training data inflates performance metrics and makes accurate assessment difficult. **Unlike existing dynamic benchmarks**, which simply use newly collected data, AntiLeak-Bench verifies that the knowledge is genuinely new and absent from LLMs' training sets. This ensures **contamination-free evaluation** by constructing samples querying this updated knowledge. Furthermore, its **fully automated** workflow eliminates human labor, allowing easy maintenance and adaptation to new LLMs, unlike resource-intensive manual updates.  This framework offers more reliable and practical benchmarking for consistent and contamination-free LLM evaluation."}}, {"heading_title": "Automated Workflow", "details": {"summary": "AntiLeak-Bench's **automated workflow** revolutionizes benchmark maintenance.  It eliminates manual updates by automatically constructing samples with newly updated real-world knowledge from Wikidata and Wikipedia.  This automation **reduces labor**, ensures **frequent updates**, and enables the benchmark to **adapt to emerging LLMs**.  The workflow retrieves updated claims, identifies corresponding Wikipedia articles and revisions after the LLM's cutoff time, and constructs contamination-free samples querying the updated knowledge with the supporting documents as context.  This ensures evaluation remains relevant and reliable, addressing the challenge of data contamination and enhancing benchmark scalability."}}, {"heading_title": "Contamination-Free Eval", "details": {"summary": "**Data contamination** significantly affects LLM evaluation by incorporating test data into training sets, leading to inflated performance metrics.  Existing methods attempt to mitigate this by updating benchmarks with new data, but they often lack a **guarantee of true contamination-free evaluation** as the new data may contain pre-existing knowledge or require substantial manual effort to curate and verify.  Furthermore, the **rapid emergence of new LLMs** makes frequent benchmark updates essential but challenging.  A robust approach must prioritize **strictly contamination-free samples** by verifying the novelty of the added data.  Additionally, automating the benchmark update process is vital to reducing **human labor** and ensuring that evaluations remain current and reliable with LLM advancements.  This involves automatically identifying, acquiring, and validating new knowledge, constructing corresponding test samples, and integrating them into the benchmark."}}, {"heading_title": "Multi-Lingual Benchmarks", "details": {"summary": "The **AntiLeak-Bench framework supports multi-lingual evaluation**, leveraging the diverse language capabilities of Wikidata and Wikipedia.  This allows for the **creation of benchmark datasets in various languages**, expanding the scope of LLM assessment beyond English.  This multi-lingual capacity is crucial for **evaluating the cross-lingual generalization abilities of LLMs** and for **identifying language-specific biases** that may arise from training data predominantly in English.  By incorporating diverse languages, AntiLeak-Bench facilitates a **more comprehensive and inclusive evaluation** of LLM performance, contributing to a broader understanding of their strengths and weaknesses across different linguistic contexts."}}]
