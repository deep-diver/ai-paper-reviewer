This paper addresses these challenges by focusing on **data quality** rather than simply scaling model size.  Existing LLMs primarily rely on organic data sources, which can be noisy and biased, limiting their reasoning abilities.  \nThe researchers introduce Phi-4, a new 14-billion parameter LLM, that uses **synthetic data extensively** throughout its training. This approach tackles the data quality issues by controlling the diversity and accuracy of training data.  The model also uses **innovative post-training techniques** to fine-tune its performance, resulting in superior reasoning capabilities compared to larger models and better performance on a variety of benchmarks, especially those focused on STEM and reasoning.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.08905/podcast.wav"}
