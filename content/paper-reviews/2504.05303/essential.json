{"importance": "This research enables more **realistic 3D human-object interaction reconstruction** from images. By reducing the need for extensive 3D contact annotations and providing a new method for leveraging visual-language models, this paper opens new avenues for research in robotics, mixed reality, and human behavior analysis, where understanding realistic interactions is crucial. The new contact estimation task will likely stimulate future research.", "summary": "InteractVLM estimates 3D human-object contacts from 2D images using visual-language models.", "takeaways": ["InteractVLM, a novel framework, facilitates HOI reconstruction by detecting 3D contacts on both bodies and objects from a single in-the-wild image.", "The method minimizes reliance on 3D contact annotations via exploiting the broad visual knowledge of Vision-Language Models.", "A novel \"Multi-view Localization\" model helps in estimating contacts in 3D by transforming the reasoning of foundation models from 2D to 3D."], "tldr": "Reconstructing human-object interactions (HOI) in 3D from 2D images is challenging due to occlusions and diverse object shapes. Existing methods rely on expensive 3D contact annotations, limiting scalability. To address these issues, this paper introduces a method that leverages large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to estimate 3D contact points on human bodies and objects from a single image. It also introduces a new \"Semantic Human Contact\" estimation task and overcomes the data scarcity. \n\nThe study introduces **InteractVLM**, a novel framework based on a reasoning module based on a VLM and a new Multi-View Localization model that highlights parts that are in contact. This model operates with a novel \u201cRender-Localize-Lift\u201d framework. The VLM guides the MV-Loc model to localize contacts in 3D, enhancing joint reconstruction. Experiments show that the approach outperforms existing methods on contact estimation and in facilitating 3D reconstruction, with code and models publicly available.", "affiliation": "Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, T\u00fcbingen, Germany", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05303/podcast.wav"}
