Understanding how semantic information is processed within them is crucial for enhancing their interpretability and control.  Existing methods often struggle with the complexity of multi-layer interactions, limiting our ability to analyze and influence feature development. This research tackles this issue by focusing on the dynamics of features across multiple layers.\nThe proposed approach utilizes sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to track features across different layers of the LLM, creating \"flow graphs.\"  These graphs visually represent how features originate, evolve, and eventually disappear.  The researchers demonstrate how manipulating these features through the flow graphs allows for direct and targeted control over the LLM's output, such as amplifying or suppressing specific themes in text generation.  This technique significantly improves our capacity to understand and control LLMs' behavior.", "affiliation": "T-Tech", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.03032/podcast.wav"}
