### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Zero-shot video editing simplifies changes through text, but most techniques focus on editing one object or the whole scene.  This limits localized edits for multiple objects, leading to unwanted changes elsewhere. Existing methods struggle with overlapping edits and lack good evaluation datasets. Editing multiple specific parts of a video without altering the rest remains a challenge.

**MIVE**, a **mask-based zero-shot Multi-Instance Video Editing** framework tackles these problems. **MIVE uses two novel modules**: 1) **Disentangled Multi-instance Sampling (DMS)**, reducing how edits unintentionally affect other areas. 2) **Instance-centric Probability Redistribution (IPR)**, ensuring accurate placement of edits within masks. It's tested on the **new MIVE Dataset (200 videos) using standard and a novel Cross-Instance Accuracy (CIA) score** to measure how edits affect other instances. This makes it better for more complex video edits.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-Instance VE
**Multi-instance video editing (MIVE)** tackles the complex task of editing multiple objects within a video **independently**, using text prompts and object masks.  This approach contrasts with global editing, which affects the entire video, and single-object editing, prone to impacting unintended areas. Key challenges include **preventing edits from bleeding** into other objects (attention leakage), **ensuring edits accurately reflect** text prompts, and the **lack of diverse datasets** for training and evaluation.  Current methods often struggle with overlapping bounding boxes or rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning for each new model.  Specialized metrics are needed to evaluate editing quality at the instance level, rather than simply assessing overall frame consistency or faithfulness to the global prompt.

#### MIVE Framework
The **MIVE framework** introduces a novel approach to **multi-instance video editing**, addressing limitations of prior methods that struggle with complex scenes. It leverages instance masks and captions for precise localized edits, preventing unintended changes in other video areas.  Two **key modules** power MIVE: **Disentangled Multi-instance Sampling (DMS)** minimizes "attention leakage" between edited objects, and **Instance-centric Probability Redistribution (IPR)** refines edits within instance masks. This design enables disentangled, faithful editing of multiple objects, surpassing state-of-the-art techniques in accuracy and preventing unwanted edits spreading across the video. This enhances editing precision, particularly in complex scenes with numerous or overlapping objects.

#### MIVE Dataset
The **MIVE Dataset addresses limitations** of existing multi-instance video editing datasets by providing **200 diverse videos**, instance masks, and captions.  Sourced from VIPSeg, it offers greater **diversity in instance size, number, and viewpoint**, unlike TGVE, TGVE+, or DAVIS subsets used in prior works like GAV and EVA. Notably, MIVE Dataset emphasizes **instance-level annotations** with manually refined captions using LLaVA and Llama 3. This enhances the dataset's effectiveness in evaluating **editing leakage and faithfulness**, crucial for localized video editing tasks.

#### Cross-Instance Accuracy
The **Cross-Instance Accuracy (CIA) Score** is a novel metric designed to address **attention leakage** in multi-instance video editing.  Existing metrics like **Global Textual Faithfulness (GTF)** and **Frame Accuracy (FA)** assess overall frame quality but miss **local editing nuances**.  **Instance Accuracy (IA)** and **Local Textual Faithfulness (LTF)** evaluate individual instances but **ignore cross-instance influence**.  CIA calculates cosine similarity between each instance's image and all captions, creating a similarity matrix. By isolating the highest scores for each instance, it effectively quantifies **intended vs. unintended edits** and helps reveal the extent of leakage.

#### Reflection Limitations
The paper acknowledges **limitations** regarding **reflection consistency**.  When editing objects near **reflective surfaces**, inconsistencies arise between the edited object and its reflection because the provided masks cover only the object itself, not its reflection. This discrepancy is noticeable in scenes with prominent reflective elements, like mirrors or polished floors.  Future work could address this by incorporating methods that ensure consistency between real and reflected elements during the editing process. This might involve extending the mask to include the reflection or employing specific techniques to harmonize edits with mirrored counterparts.  Addressing this issue is crucial for achieving realistic and seamless edits in videos with reflective surfaces.

> üîº This figure shows the ablation study performed on the Disentangled Multi-Instance Sampling (DMS) module within the MIVE framework. The ablation explores two primary sampling methods within DMS: Latent Parallel Sampling (LPS) and Noise Parallel Sampling (NPS). Results using only NPS show suboptimal and unfaithful edits, while those employing only LPS display noisy and blurry textures lacking fine detail. Combining LPS and NPS without re-inversion produces similar artifacts, but the edges are slightly sharper. Finally, incorporating re-inversion yields significantly improved editing quality, characterized by faithful edits, less noise, sharper boundaries, and enhanced details.

The results show that zeroing out the padding tokens can introduce noticeable artifacts, like blurring in the oven and noise on the alien's face and oven. In contrast, leaving the padding tokens unaltered produces sharper and cleaner edits, demonstrating their importance in achieving higher-quality image generation.

> üîº This figure analyzes the impact of various attention redistribution strategies within the Instance-centric Probability Redistribution (IPR) module. It demonstrates that shifting attention from the start-of-sequence (S), or text (T) / end-of-sequence (E) tokens to padding tokens negatively impacts editing fidelity, resulting in reduced accuracy.  Conversely, redistributing attention probability from the S token to the T and E tokens, controlled by a factor \(\lambda_s\), leads to more faithful edits. The proposed dynamic approach for adjusting  \(\lambda_s\) yields the most accurate results.

> üîº This figure presents an ablation study on Instance-centric Probability Redistribution (IPR) by modifying the hyperparameter Œª.  It shows qualitative results on a video editing task, demonstrating that increasing Œª enhances details and textures in the edited output. However, an excessively large value (0.6) leads to unwanted artifacts. A balanced trade-off between detail enhancement and artifact reduction is achieved at Œª = 0.4. Example: Enhancing details on objects like beaker, robot head, and hands while maintaining quality of wood carvings and avoiding artifacts on a glass table. The visualization includes input frames, outputs for different lambda values (0.2, 0.4, 0.6), and the object prompts/queries used during the experiment.

It shows how different percentages (60%, 80%, and 100%) affect the editing results, particularly in terms of faithfulness and artifacts. Increasing IPR steps can enhance faithfulness (e.g., better wood carvings, rust effects, facial details) but too many steps (100%) can lead to artifacts like noise (e.g., on the glass table). The figure shows 80% as the optimal trade-off.

It evaluates the performance of different DMS and IPR configurations using metrics such as Local Temporal Consistency (LTC), Local Textual Faithfulness (LTF), Instance Accuracy (IA), Cross-Instance Accuracy (CIA), and Background Preservation (BP).  The results show that using Latent Parallel Sampling (LPS) and Noise Parallel Sampling (NPS) in conjunction with a re-inversion step leads to the best overall performance in terms of faithfulness and leakage reduction for MIVE. The comparison between the baseline cross-attention mechanism without modulation and two other attention modulation methods demonstrates that the proposed Instance-centric Probability Redistribution (IPR) is more effective in achieving faithful editing with fewer artifacts.

> üîº This table presents the ablation study results for Disentangled Multi-instance Sampling (DMS), a key component of the MIVE framework.  It explores variations in alternating Latent Parallel Sampling (LPS) and Noise Parallel Sampling (NPS) steps, the use of re-inversion, and the choice of 2D vs. 3D models during re-inversion. The impact of these configurations is measured using metrics like GTC, GTF, FA, LTC, LTF, IA, CIA, and BP.  The table highlights the trade-offs between different sampling strategies and the importance of re-inversion for achieving high editing faithfulness while maintaining temporal consistency and minimizing artifacts. The goal is to identify the optimal DMS configuration for the MIVE framework.
