However, even with test-time reasoning, these systems struggle with complex software tasks. Current methods also rely on static datasets, limiting the model's capacity to dynamically refine outputs. To address this, the paper introduces a new approach to enhance code generation capabilities and reasoning in AI agents.\n\nThis paper introduces a code generation and reasoning agent based on LLMs (**CURA**), enhanced by a novel verbal process supervision (VPS). The CURA improves code understanding and reasoning through iterative feedback at each step. Results show that CURA achieves better performance on challenging benchmarks. The **VPS guides the reasoning process**, enabling the agent to generate better code. This integrated approach improves performance by combining feedback and supervision throughout the reasoning pipeline.", "affiliation": "Mindify AI, United States", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18494/podcast.wav"}
