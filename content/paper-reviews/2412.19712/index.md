### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current generative models for graphic design often focus on subtasks and lack consideration for the hierarchical structure inherent in design composition. This leads to suboptimal results and high costs for manual integration. This paper addresses these issues.

The proposed LaDeCo model leverages a **layered design approach** and **large multimodal models** to achieve design composition. By sequentially generating design layers based on semantic labels and incorporating previously generated layers into the context, LaDeCo overcomes the limitations of existing methods. The **experimental results demonstrate LaDeCo's effectiveness** in generating high-quality designs, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines and showcasing promising applications like resolution adjustment and element filling.

### In-depth insights


#### Layered Design
The concept of 'Layered Design' in the context of automated graphic design is a significant contribution.  It mimics the human design process, breaking down a complex task into manageable sub-tasks. By tackling design layer by layer‚Äîfrom background to embellishments‚Äîit enables a more intuitive and coherent design generation. **This layered approach greatly enhances the model's ability to capture contextual information and make design decisions.**  Each layer's output serves as input for the next, promoting a more natural and progressive generation, rather than a holistic, simultaneous approach. **This hierarchical structure not only improves the overall quality of designs but also contributes to greater efficiency and flexibility**, enabling the model to handle subtasks such as typography and layout generation more effectively. The successful implementation of this layered approach is a key finding of this research, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for future applications in automated graphic design.

#### LMM Composition
The concept of "LMM Composition" in the context of automated graphic design suggests a layered approach leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs).  This method is **innovative** because it breaks down the complex task of design composition into smaller, manageable steps.  Instead of directly generating a complete design, **the LMM iteratively constructs the design layer by layer**, starting with the background and adding subsequent layers (underlay, logo/image, text, embellishments) sequentially. Each layer's generation utilizes the rendered output of previous layers as context, facilitating a cohesive and coherent final product. This **layered approach mirrors human design processes**, promoting efficiency and clarity.  The method's strength lies in its ability to handle various design subtasks (e.g., typography generation, layout adjustment) without retraining, demonstrating **adaptability and versatility**.  The use of LMMs enables the system to understand multimodal elements and their relationships, leading to more nuanced and aesthetically pleasing designs.  However, future work should investigate the scalability of this method with significantly larger datasets and more complex design scenarios.

#### LaDeCo Approach
The LaDeCo approach presents a novel solution to automatic graphic design composition by leveraging a **layered design principle** within large multimodal models.  Instead of tackling the complex task holistically, LaDeCo intelligently decomposes it into smaller, manageable subtasks, focusing on one layer at a time. This **layer-wise generation** not only streamlines the process but also allows for better context utilization, as preceding layers inform the creation of subsequent ones.  The approach incorporates a **layer planning module** to effectively categorize input elements into their respective semantic layers, ensuring a logical and organized design structure.  By utilizing pre-trained language models for layer planning and multimodal models for attribute prediction, LaDeCo demonstrates significant improvements in design composition, surpassing existing methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Its **flexibility** extends to handling various design subtasks effectively, such as resolution adjustment and element filling, further highlighting its practicality and versatility.

#### Experimental Setup
A robust experimental setup is crucial for validating the proposed LaDeCo model.  The selection of the Crello-v4 dataset, while publicly available, presents some limitations.  **Filtering out samples with more than 25 elements impacts the generalizability of the findings**, potentially skewing results towards simpler designs. The use of Llama-3.1-8B as the backbone model, along with the LoRA technique for efficient training, represents a reasonable choice given the need for a powerful yet resource-efficient approach. **Comparing against state-of-the-art baselines like FlexDM and GPT-40 provides a valuable context for evaluating LaDeCo's performance**.  However, the lack of a more comprehensive benchmark with greater diversity in design complexity and style might limit the scope of the evaluation.  The ablation study, varying parameters such as LoRA rank and base model, helps assess the model's robustness and sensitivity to these choices.  **The inclusion of a qualitative evaluation alongside quantitative metrics allows for a more holistic assessment**, including visual inspection of generated designs and comparison to ground truth.  Finally, the extension to a larger dataset (LargeCrello) offers a preliminary exploration of scalability, but more extensive analysis would be needed to fully establish LaDeCo's capabilities with high-volume data.

#### Future of Design
The future of design is inextricably linked to advancements in **artificial intelligence** and **large multimodal models**.  AI-powered tools are poised to automate many tasks currently performed by human designers, leading to increased efficiency and potentially more creative outputs.  **Layered design principles**, as explored in the paper, offer a structured approach to complex design composition, promising **better collaboration between AI and human designers**. However, the **ethical considerations** surrounding AI-generated content, including issues of authorship, bias, and job displacement, necessitate careful consideration and mitigation strategies.  Moreover, the potential for AI to **democratize design** through accessibility and ease of use must be balanced with the need to maintain design quality and uphold human creativity. Ultimately, the most successful future of design will likely involve a **symbiotic relationship between human ingenuity and AI augmentation**, where AI handles repetitive tasks and supports the creative process, leaving the most complex and nuanced design decisions in the hands of human experts.

> üîº LaDeCo, a layered design composition method, is illustrated in this figure.  It begins by using GPT-40 to assign semantic labels (background, underlay, logo/image, text, embellishment) to input elements, determining the layer structure.  LaDeCo then uses Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) in a layer-by-layer process.  Each layer's attributes are predicted, and the rendered image of previous layers is incorporated into the LMM's input for context during subsequent layer generation. This approach breaks down the complex design process into smaller, manageable steps.
