Manually creating environment descriptions for agent learning is time-consuming. To tackle these, this paper introduces **SynWorld**, a framework for agents to synthesize scenarios with multi-step action invocation. Then, agents learn new environments with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) exploration to refine action knowledge effectively.\n\nWith SynWorld, agents explore synthesized virtual scenarios via MCTS to optimize action knowledge by learning how to plan. Experiments show action knowledge learned in **SynWorld generalizes to the real world**. The framework enables thorough refinement between action descriptions and workflow patterns, ensuring better alignment with environmental constraints.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03561/podcast.wav"}
