First, it extracts composable tools to create new scenes and tasks by synthesizing virtual scenarios.  Second, agents explore these scenarios using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to refine their action knowledge. This iterative process optimizes actions and plans, enabling agents to learn how to execute actions and plan tasks effectively in unfamiliar environments.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.03561/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: The variation in the pass rate of agents on the ToolBench in relation to the number of exploration scenarios.", "description": "This figure displays the relationship between the number of exploration scenarios used and the success rate of agents performing tasks in the ToolBench dataset.

Two lines are plotted: one showing the pass rate in the virtual (simulated) environment, and another showing the pass rate in the real world, after transferring knowledge gained during virtual training.  The x-axis represents the number of iterations of optimization, and the y-axis shows the pass rate (percentage of tasks completed successfully). The graph illustrates how virtual training improves performance, and how the benefit of this training transfers to real-world scenarios. The virtual pass rate shows improvement that plateaus over time indicating a limit to the improvement from the virtual training. The real world pass rate also improves but does not quite reach the level of performance seen in the virtual environment.", "section": "4.4 Futher Analysis"}]
