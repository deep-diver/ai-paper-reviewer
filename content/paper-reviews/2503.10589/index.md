### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Recent advances in video generation can produce realistic single-shot videos, but real-world videos require multi-shot scenes with consistency across shots. There is a gap between current single-shot video capabilities and real video content production demands. Bridging this gap necessitates evolving from single-shot synthesis to scene-level generation, where a scene is a series of coherent single-shot videos. This requires consistency in visual appearance and temporal dynamics to ensure a coherent narration flow. Current solutions struggle with both visual and temporal coherence across shots. 



To solve the problem, the paper introduces **Long Context Tuning (LCT), a training paradigm that expands the context window of pre-trained single-shot video diffusion models to learn scene-level consistency directly from data.** LCT expands full attention mechanisms to encompass all shots within a scene, incorporating interleaved 3D position embedding and an asynchronous noise strategy. This enables both joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. The method demonstrated single-shot models after LCT can produce coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibit compositional generation and interactive shot extension.

### In-depth insights


#### Scene-Level Gen
**Scene-Level Generation** marks a significant advancement in AI-driven content creation, shifting the focus from isolated, single-shot video clips to the generation of coherent and contextually consistent multi-shot scenes. This transition addresses a key limitation of earlier video generation models, which often struggled to maintain visual and dynamic consistency across multiple shots, a crucial element in narrative storytelling. The emergence of **appearance-conditioned** and **keyframe-based methods** signals an effort to enforce cross-shot coherence, either by conditioning on visual elements such as character identity and background or by generating coherent keyframes to guide subsequent video synthesis. Despite these advancements, challenges remain in modeling complex scene-level coherence and ensuring temporal consistency across shots, highlighting the need for innovative approaches that can effectively capture and reproduce the intricate dynamics of real-world scenes.

#### Long Context Tuning
**Long Context Tuning (LCT)** focuses on expanding the contextual understanding of video generation models. This involves increasing the model's ability to maintain consistency and coherence across extended video sequences or 'scenes'. Traditional video generation models often struggle with long-range dependencies, resulting in inconsistencies in character identity, environment, and plot progression over time. LCT aims to address these limitations by enabling models to capture and utilize information from a wider temporal context. The key idea is to train the model to understand the relationships between different parts of a video sequence, allowing it to generate more realistic and coherent content. This may involve techniques such as increasing the receptive field of the model, incorporating memory mechanisms, or using attention mechanisms to focus on relevant information from the past. Effective LCT can lead to significant improvements in video quality, realism, and storytelling capabilities, paving the way for more sophisticated and engaging video content creation.

#### Causal Attention
While the term 'Causal Attention' isn't explicitly a heading, the paper discusses context-causal attention as a refinement over bidirectional attention in video generation. The essence revolves around **directionality**: cleaner history samples require less from subsequent ones, making bidirectional attention redundant. By implementing context-causal attention (bidirectional within a shot, but tokens attend only to preceding context), and fine-tuning the causal variant, allows K, V features cached from history sample generation, **eliminating repeated computation and reducing overhead**. It prioritizes past information, leading to better consistency and enabling efficient auto-regressive generation crucial for extending video sequences. This technique effectively enforces sequential dependency, thereby giving greater weight to preceding conditions, also contributing for **maintaining coherence and reducing artifacts**.

#### Emergent Capabil.
The "Emergent Capabilities" section highlights the novel functionalities that arise in the model **after** Long Context Tuning (LCT), exceeding its pre-trained capabilities. A notable example is **conditional and compositional generation**, where the model synthesizes coherent videos by combining separate identity and environment images, despite not being explicitly trained for this task. This stems from the model's learned scene-level visual relations. The model demonstrates single-shot extension, enabling **interactive shot extension** without abrupt cuts, creating seamless connections between existing and desired future content. This is facilitated by removing the '[SHOT CUT]' marker and crafting bridging prompts. Interactive generation further allows directors to shape content iteratively based on previously generated footage.

#### Context Matters
The idea of 'context matters' is crucial for video generation. Current models produce realistic, minute-long, single-shot videos. However, real-world videos have multi-shot scenes that require visual and dynamic consistency across shots. Long Context Tuning (LCT) addresses this by expanding the context window of pre-trained single-shot models to learn scene-level consistency. LCT uses full attention mechanisms, interleaved 3D position embedding, and an asynchronous noise strategy. This enables joint and auto-regressive shot generation without additional parameters. LCT can create coherent multi-shot scenes and exhibits emerging capabilities, including compositional generation and interactive shot extension. LCT paves the way for more practical visual content creation by emphasizing the need to move from single-shot synthesis to scene-level generation, where scenes are defined as a series of single-shot videos with coherent events unfolding over time. **Visual coherence** and **temporal coherence** are critical for scene-level video generation.

> üîº Figure 2 shows an example of the scene-level video data used in the paper.  The figure highlights the two-tiered prompt structure used for generating videos: a global prompt that provides high-level information about characters, the setting, and the overall story; and per-shot prompts that give detailed instructions for each individual shot within the scene. This structure allows for a more nuanced control over the video generation process, ensuring consistency across shots while allowing for specific variations in each shot's content.

> üîº Figure 3 illustrates the architecture of the Long Context Tuning (LCT) model.  Panel (a) shows the Long-context MMDiT block, which extends the attention mechanism to encompass all text and video tokens within a scene. This allows the model to consider relationships between multiple shots simultaneously. It also incorporates independent noise levels for individual shots and uses 3D RoPE (Rotary Positional Embedding) to represent the positional information of tokens within the scene. The 3D RoPE provides a better representation of the spatial and temporal relationships between shots. Panel (b) details how the interleaved 3D RoPE coordinates are organized. At the shot level, text tokens appear before video tokens along the space diagonal, and at the scene level, shots are arranged sequentially, forming an interleaved pattern of text and video tokens. This organization helps the model understand the sequential structure of the scenes and learn the relationships between consecutive shots.

> üîº This figure shows how the choice of conditioning timestep in the autoregressive inference method affects the quality of the generated video.  A smaller timestep (closer to 0) uses cleaner history samples as conditions which leads to better fidelity to the original condition. However, using a very small timestep can lead to error accumulation, where errors from earlier frames are propagated to later frames. A larger timestep results in some loss of fidelity to the initial conditions, but helps mitigate the error accumulation problem. The figure illustrates this trade-off by showing the effect of different timesteps (500 and 900) on the fidelity of the video background compared to the original condition.

> üîº This figure shows the impact of different conditioning timesteps on the quality of autoregressive video generation.  The experiment uses a model where previous frames are used as conditioning information (history) for generating subsequent frames.  Using clean history (timestep 0) preserves the most detail from past frames, but errors accumulate over time. As the timestep increases, some detail is lost from the history, but the overall structure and consistency of the generated video are better maintained as the model isn't overly influenced by small errors in earlier frames. The figure demonstrates a trade-off between preserving fidelity to the initial history (clean history) and mitigating the accumulation of errors in longer sequences.

Starting with weights from a bidirectional model, the model was fine-tuned with causal attention.  After only 1000 training iterations, the context-causal model displays significantly improved consistency in generated videos, comparable to the results achieved after substantially more training (9000 iterations). This highlights the efficiency of the causal adaptation process and its ability to quickly acquire the desired temporal coherence in video generation.
