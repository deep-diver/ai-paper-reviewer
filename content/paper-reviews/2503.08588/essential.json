Existing debiasing strategies, such as retraining or representation projection, can be inefficient or fail to directly alter biased internal representations. Thus, there's a need for more effective methods to eliminate bias from models while preserving their language capabilities. \n\nTo address the issues, this paper introduces **BIASEDIT**, a model editing method that uses lightweight networks to generate parameter updates, removing stereotypical bias from language models. It employs a debiasing loss to guide edits on partial parameters and a retention loss to maintain language modeling abilities. Experiments demonstrate BIASEDIT's effectiveness in eliminating bias with minimal impact on general capabilities.", "affiliation": "University of California, San Diego", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.08588/podcast.wav"}
