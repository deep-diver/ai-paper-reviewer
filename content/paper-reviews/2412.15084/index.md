### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current large language models (LLMs) struggle with complex mathematical problems.  Existing math-specialized LLMs often lack robustness and reliable evaluation methods.  There's a need for more effective training processes and better ways to assess the quality of generated solutions.

AceMath introduces a new suite of powerful math models, significantly outperforming existing systems.  This is achieved through a two-stage fine-tuning process and a novel reward model, AceMath-RM. The project also introduces AceMath-RewardBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating reward models.  The models and datasets are open-sourced to facilitate further research.

### In-depth insights


#### SFT for Math LLMs
Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) plays a crucial role in enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs).  **Effective SFT for math LLMs necessitates high-quality training data**, often involving a combination of carefully curated prompts and synthetically generated responses.  A **two-stage SFT approach** can be particularly effective: first, performing SFT on general domains to build a strong foundation of instruction-following and reasoning skills; then, conducting targeted SFT using a carefully curated math dataset to hone the LLM's mathematical abilities. The quality of synthetic data is crucial.  **Data decontamination techniques** are essential to mitigate bias and prevent memorization of test samples.  **Careful consideration of the training process**, including the choice of optimizer and learning rate, are also vital factors to achieve optimal results and improve model performance on math-specific benchmarks.

#### Reward Model Design
Designing effective reward models is crucial for training high-performing language models, particularly in complex domains like mathematics.  The paper emphasizes a robust benchmark, **AceMath-RewardBench**, for comprehensive evaluation, going beyond existing limitations. The training strategy focuses on a **systematic approach**, addressing issues like stylistic biases and data quality.  A key aspect is the use of **score-sorted sampling** to create balanced positive-negative pairs, enhancing the model's ability to discriminate correctly. The choice of **listwise Bradley-Terry loss** shows efficiency and effectiveness for optimization.  The resulting AceMath-RM consistently surpasses state-of-the-art reward models, demonstrating the success of this thoughtful design process.

#### AceMath Benchmarks
AceMath Benchmarks would ideally encompass a diverse range of mathematical problems, spanning various difficulty levels and topics.  **Comprehensive coverage** is key; including arithmetic, algebra, calculus, geometry, and potentially even more advanced areas like abstract algebra or number theory. The benchmarks should not only assess the accuracy of solutions but also the **reasoning process**.  This could involve evaluating the clarity, completeness, and correctness of the steps taken to arrive at an answer.  **Diverse problem formats** (multiple-choice, free-response, proof-based) would also enhance the robustness of the evaluation.  Finally, **scalability** is crucial.  The benchmark should be designed to easily accommodate future growth, enabling the assessment of ever-larger and more sophisticated models.  The selection of existing datasets should be justified and the rationale clearly described.  A strong AceMath Benchmark would be a valuable tool for assessing progress in the field of mathematical reasoning within large language models.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove components of a model or training process to assess their individual contributions.  In this context, **several key ablation studies** were conducted.  The impact of different training strategies (e.g., two-stage vs. single-stage fine-tuning) on model performance was evaluated, revealing the effectiveness of a staged approach.  The influence of various datasets and training techniques for reward model development was also analyzed.  **The results demonstrated the importance of careful data selection and the choice of training methodologies.**   Furthermore, studies investigated the influence of using different base models and the impact of synthetic data on overall model accuracy.  These ablation experiments provided crucial insights into the design choices and the robustness of the proposed AceMath models, **highlighting the critical role of specific components in achieving state-of-the-art performance.**

#### Future Directions
Future research directions for advancing frontier math reasoning with LLMs could involve exploring more sophisticated reward modeling techniques, **such as incorporating step-wise reasoning or incorporating external knowledge sources** into the reward function.  Further improvements could be made by developing larger and more diverse training datasets, perhaps focusing on problems that require complex multi-step reasoning and problem decomposition.  **Investigating more advanced training strategies** that better leverage synthetic data and minimize issues related to data contamination is also crucial.  Additionally, **research into the interpretability of the models' reasoning processes** would be valuable, as it would allow for greater insights into the models' strengths and weaknesses, as well as providing a way to debug or improve them. Finally, it will be important to **develop robust and standardized benchmarks** for evaluating math reasoning capabilities, helping to compare across different models and promote fair and meaningful comparisons.

> üîº This table presents the performance of AceMath-Instruct models (AceMath-1.5B, AceMath-7B, and AceMath-72B) on two prominent math competitions: AIME 2024 (American Invitational Mathematics Examination) and AMC 2023 (American Mathematics Competitions).  The results are shown as the number of problems correctly solved out of the total number of problems for each model.  This allows for a comparison of the AceMath models against each other and provides insight into their capabilities on challenging mathematical problems with varying difficulty levels.

> üîº This table presents the performance of AceMath-Instruct models trained on various base models. It compares AceMath-Instruct's performance with that of several strong baselines on a variety of math benchmarks, allowing for an assessment of the model's effectiveness across different backbone models.  Results are based on greedy decoding (pass@1).
