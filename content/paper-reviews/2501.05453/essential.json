This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a new approach: autoregressive pre-training directly from videos.  The researchers used a large and diverse dataset, exceeding 1 trillion visual tokens, to train their models. The main challenge they faced was the lack of inherent sequential structure in video data compared to text, which they overcame using a raster scan approach.  The study highlights a significant limitation of relying solely on internet videos because of their variability in quality and diversity.\nThe paper proposes a family of autoregressive video models called \"Toto.\"  They tested the models' effectiveness on various downstream tasks like image recognition, video classification, and object tracking, demonstrating competitive results despite minimal inductive bias.  They discovered that their model scales similarly to language models, although at a different rate.  The research also analyzed the impact of design choices like tokenizers and pooling methods, and found attention pooling to significantly outperform average pooling.  These findings offer crucial insights into building efficient and effective video AI systems.
