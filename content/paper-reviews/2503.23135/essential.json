Lightweight models leverage self-attention and convolutions for token mixing which poses limitations in effectiveness and efficiency. This dependence brings limitations in perception and aggregation, hindering the balance between performance and efficiency under limited computational budgets.\n\nTo address these issues, this paper draws inspiration from the human visual system by introducing the **\"See Large, Focus Small\"** strategy for lightweight vision network design. To enable this strategy, the authors introduce **LS (Large-Small) convolution**, combining large-kernel perception and small-kernel aggregation. Based on LS convolution, the authors present a new family of lightweight models, **LSNet**. Results demonstrate that LSNet can achieve superior performance and efficiency over existing lightweight networks in various vision tasks.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2503.23135/podcast.wav"}
