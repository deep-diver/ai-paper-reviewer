{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses a critical limitation of current video generation models: **incoherent motion**. By introducing VideoJAM, researchers gain a new tool to improve video generation significantly and provides a new framework for generating temporally consistent videos. This opens exciting new avenues in video editing, visual effects, and other areas reliant on high-quality video generation.", "summary": "VideoJAM enhances video generation by jointly learning appearance and motion representations, achieving state-of-the-art motion coherence.", "takeaways": ["VideoJAM improves motion coherence in video generation models by learning a joint appearance-motion representation.", "The Inner-Guidance mechanism in VideoJAM effectively steers video generation toward coherent motion using the model's own motion prediction.", "VideoJAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in motion coherence without requiring modifications to training data or model scaling."], "tldr": "Current generative video models struggle with creating realistic motion due to their focus on visual fidelity over motion coherence. This often results in videos with unnatural or physically impossible movements.  The pixel-based training objective used in these models does not prioritize temporal consistency, leading to these limitations. \nVideoJAM tackles this problem by introducing a novel framework that instills a strong motion prior into the video generation process.  It does so by simultaneously predicting both the visual appearance and the corresponding motion from a single representation.  Furthermore, VideoJAM uses a unique 'Inner-Guidance' mechanism that leverages the model\u2019s own evolving motion predictions to further guide the generation towards temporal coherence. This approach significantly boosts motion coherence, surpasses existing models, and improves overall video quality.", "affiliation": "Meta AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.02492/podcast.wav"}
