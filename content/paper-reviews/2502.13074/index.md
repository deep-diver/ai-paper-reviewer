### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The Brownian sphere, a random metric space, is the scaling limit of random planar maps.  It can be directly built using a continuous version of the Cori-Vauquelin-Schaeffer (CVS) bijection, which maps Aldous' continuum random tree with Brownian labels (the Brownian snake) to the Brownian sphere. This work focuses on inverting this bijection which is mapping the sphere back to the snake. However, the main issue is the original CVS bijection to construct Brownian sphere omitted the orientation of the sphere which brings in a couple of issues. 



To address the problems of inverting CVS bijection, the paper gives a measurable way to construct the Brownian snake back by constructing the inverse of the CVS bijection from the Brownian sphere. The method needs special care to reconstruct the orientation. Main results includes a measurable function mapping the Brownian sphere (with two independent points) to an R-tree and a label function. This ensures the tree follows CRT distribution, labels are Brownian, and original sphere is recovered. The paper further discusses the roles of marked points and provides a more precise statement and proof.

> üîº The figure illustrates key components of the Brownian sphere, highlighting the relationship between the Brownian tree and the sphere's geometry.  Specifically, it shows the cut locus (in red), which is the set of points in the sphere with multiple shortest paths to a reference point (xW‚Å∞), and the relative interiors of geodesics (in blue), which are paths in the tree that connect to the reference point. The two distinguished points (xW‚Å∞ and xW¬π), along with two additional points (x and y), are also shown to illustrate the relationships. This visualization aids in understanding the inverse continuum CVS mapping process.

### In-depth insights


#### Brownian Snake
The "Brownian snake" refers to a **continuous Markov process** that encodes the trajectory of a labeled tree. This process arises as the limit of discrete snake-like explorations on random trees, mirroring how Brownian motion arises from random walks. The snake's head, represented by a process Z indexed by the tree's contour, carries the **Brownian label**. The **lifetime process** is denoted as 'e'.  In the context of the Brownian sphere, the Brownian snake plays a fundamental role in inverting the CVS bijection, which maps between random trees with labels and random metric spaces homeomorphic to the sphere. The snake's properties, particularly its continuous path and the independent increments of its labels along disjoint paths in the tree, are crucial for reconstructing the underlying tree structure from the sphere's metric.

#### CVS Inverse Map
The paper delves into inverting the continuous Cori-Vauquelin-Schaeffer (CVS) bijection, a crucial step in understanding the relationship between random trees and the Brownian sphere. The inverse map aims to reconstruct the Brownian snake, the core element in the sphere's construction, directly from the sphere itself. Constructing the inverse is challenging because the **CVS bijection is not injective**, requiring the introduction of an orientation to resolve ambiguities. The approach uses the cut locus of a point on the Brownian sphere and constructs an R-tree whose Brownian labels represent the snake. **Measurability issues** are handled carefully, ensuring the inverse map is well-defined. The inverse function hinges on recovering an orientation parameter, along with utilizing geometric features like cut loci to reconstruct tree structures and their labels.

#### Orientation Choice
The orientation choice in the context of the Brownian sphere is a subtle but crucial aspect. Unlike smooth manifolds where standard definitions of orientation readily apply, the Brownian sphere, arising as a scaling limit of random planar maps, presents challenges due to its singular nature. **Previous works often circumvented explicit discussion of orientation**, yet it plays a significant role in inverting the CVS bijection. The paper highlights that **there are two possible orientations for the Brownian sphere**, reversing which corresponds to reflecting the CRT. The authors propose addressing this by considering the Brownian sphere as a metric space and assigning a random orientation based on a variable, accounting for the two possibilities. This approach introduces measurability issues that need careful handling, contrasting with defining the Brownian sphere directly as an oriented metric space, which would necessitate revisiting existing constructions. Ultimately, **handling the orientation is vital for constructing a measurable inverse of the CVS bijection**.

#### CRT Recovery
While the input text doesn't explicitly have a 'CRT Recovery' section, inferring from the context, it would likely discuss how to reconstruct the **Continuum Random Tree (CRT)** from the **Brownian sphere**. It may involve inverting the **CVS bijection**.  Key aspects would involve using the cut locus and understanding the roles of the marked points and orientation. The recovery process would need to measurably map features of the Brownian sphere (distances, area measure) back to the tree structure and Brownian labels of the snake. The challenge lies in dealing with the non-uniqueness due to orientation and ensuring measurability of the inverse mapping, and the use of metric measure space to achieve that.

#### Measure's Role
The paper emphasizes the **crucial role of the area measure** (Œº) in characterizing the Brownian sphere. While the metric structure (d) largely defines the sphere, the area measure provides additional information, enabling a more complete description. Le Gall's work [15] indicates that the measure is **almost surely determined by the metric**. The paper also explores the connection between the Gromov-Hausdorff space and the measure by defining mappings and emphasizing that these are invariant under the specific isometries used, and that the measure could be defined using them. This hints at a deeper interplay between metric and measure, suggesting that measure-theoretic properties are **intrinsic to the geometric structure** of the Brownian sphere and can be characterized by the geometry.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates key properties of the Brownian sphere.  Two points, x and y, are selected outside of the cut locus (Cw) and the set of relative interiors of geodesics to x¬πw (Fw).  A unique geodesic connects each point to x¬πw. The union of these geodesics up to their intersection at a point z is represented by a thick blue line and denoted as Œìw(x, y). The thick red curve Cw(x, y) shows the set of points that have at least two geodesics connecting them to x¬πw and that these geodesics separate x from y. Point z is highlighted to emphasize its role in this separation.

The loop Œ≥(x) separates the sphere into two regions, Dx and its complement.  The orientation is determined such that the loop circles Dx counterclockwise, based on a specific ordering of the geodesics,  ensuring a consistent orientation regardless of the choice of point x.  The gray shaded area represents Dx.
