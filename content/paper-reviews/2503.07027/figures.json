This approach enables efficient and flexible resolution training. The framework incorporates a Causal Attention mechanism, which enables the implementation of a Key-Value (KV) Cache to substantially improve inference efficiency. Furthermore, our design facilitates the seamless integration of multiple Condition Injection LoRA Modules, enabling robust and harmonious multi-condition generation.", "description": "EasyControl injects condition signals into a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via a new condition branch and a lightweight Condition Injection LoRA Module.
