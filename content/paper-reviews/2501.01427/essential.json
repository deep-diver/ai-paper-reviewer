Many existing approaches are two-stage processes, making them susceptible to errors. They also often lack the ability to inject the object's identity throughout the video leading to identity and motion inconsistencies in the later frames.\nVideoAnydoor overcomes these limitations by introducing an end-to-end framework.  It uses an ID extractor to ensure consistent object identity, and a pixel warper that aligns pixel details with user-specified trajectories for precise motion control.  This approach, combined with a novel training strategy that uses a mix of real and simulated video data, significantly improves the quality of video object insertion and enables users to precisely control the objects' motion with trajectory lines or boxes.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2501.01427/podcast.wav"}
