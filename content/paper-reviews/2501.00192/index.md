### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for image safety assessment heavily rely on human labeling, which is expensive and time-consuming. This paper tackles this problem by proposing a novel zero-shot approach called CLUE that uses pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to automatically judge image safety based on a set of predefined safety rules (constitution), without human intervention.  This approach addresses the limitations of simply querying MLLMs due to the subjective nature of safety rules and biases in the models.

CLUE enhances the effectiveness of zero-shot safety judgments by objectifying safety rules, assessing rule relevance to images, using debiased token probabilities, and employing cascaded reasoning if needed.  The method is tested on various MLLMs and shows high accuracy and efficiency.  It significantly reduces reliance on human annotation, paving the way for large-scale, cost-effective image content moderation. **The zero-shot nature and high accuracy of CLUE make it a significant contribution to the field of AI-driven content safety.**

### In-depth insights


#### Zero-shot Image Safety
Zero-shot image safety tackles a critical challenge in AI: **identifying unsafe images without relying on human-labeled training data.** This approach is highly desirable due to the significant cost and effort associated with manual annotation, especially when safety guidelines are complex and frequently updated. The core idea revolves around leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to directly assess images against a predefined set of safety rules.  However, simply querying MLLMs often yields unsatisfactory results due to several factors including the **subjectivity of safety rules**, **complexity of rules**, and **inherent model biases.**  To overcome these challenges, techniques like objectifying safety rules, assessing rule-image relevance, and employing debiased token probability analysis are crucial.  These methods are aimed at improving both the effectiveness and efficiency of zero-shot image safety assessment, **reducing the reliance on expensive and time-consuming human annotation** while paving the way for more scalable and adaptable solutions.

#### MLLM-based Judge
The concept of an "MLLM-based Judge" for image safety assessment presents a compelling approach to automating the process, especially considering the limitations of human labeling.  The method leverages the pattern recognition abilities of large language models to evaluate images against predefined safety rules, offering a potential solution to scaling challenges.  **A key strength lies in its zero-shot capability**, eliminating the need for extensive human-labeled training data. However, the approach faces hurdles.  **Subjectivity in safety rules and inherent biases within MLLMs** can lead to inconsistencies and inaccurate judgments. The authors address these limitations through methods like objectifying rules, relevance scanning, and debiased token probability analysis. These strategies aim to improve accuracy and efficiency, but further refinement is needed to guarantee robust performance in real-world scenarios.  The success of this approach hinges on the ability to effectively mitigate MLLM biases and manage complex rule sets, which necessitates ongoing research and development.

#### CLUE Framework
The CLUE framework, as described in the research paper, presents a novel approach to zero-shot image safety judgment. It tackles the challenges of subjective safety rules and inherent biases in pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by employing a multi-stage process.  **Objectifying safety rules** transforms ambiguous guidelines into actionable statements for the MLLM. A **relevance scanning** module efficiently filters irrelevant rules using CLIP, ensuring that only pertinent rules are processed by the MLLM.  **Precondition extraction** simplifies complex rules into logically complete, simplified chains of thought, improving MLLM reasoning.  Finally, **debiased token probability** analysis mitigates biases in MLLM responses.  The framework's cascading design incorporates chain-of-thought processes when necessary, yielding highly effective zero-shot image safety judgments.  Overall, CLUE's innovative approach offers significant advantages by mitigating the limitations of traditional methods and reducing the reliance on expensive human annotation.

#### Bias Mitigation
Mitigating bias in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for reliable image safety assessment.  The authors address this by acknowledging the inherent subjectivity of safety rules and the complexity of lengthy constitutions.  **They propose objectifying these rules, transforming ambiguous guidelines into clear, actionable statements.**  The approach further leverages a multi-stage reasoning process to overcome limitations in LLMs' capabilities. This includes relevance scanning to focus on pertinent rules for each image and then employing a two-pronged strategy for debiased token probability-based judgment.  **The first strategy compares the probability of positive outcomes with and without image tokens to reduce biases from language priors.** The second tackles bias from non-centric image regions by comparing scores with and without the central region of the image. This dual approach ensures robust assessment, even in cases of complex rules and varied image content. **Cascaded reasoning is introduced as a fallback to increase accuracy when the token-probability approach is uncertain.** This multifaceted approach demonstrates a deeper understanding of inherent LLM challenges and presents a novel, effective method for bias mitigation in zero-shot image safety analysis.

#### Future Works
Future work could explore several promising avenues. **Improving the robustness of the system** to handle noisy or ambiguous inputs, such as low-resolution images or text with misspellings, is crucial.  **Addressing inherent biases** within MLLMs is another important area; further research into bias detection and mitigation techniques could significantly improve the accuracy and fairness of the safety judgments.  **Developing more sophisticated reasoning methods** that can better handle complex, nuanced safety rules and integrate external knowledge sources would increase the system's understanding of context.  Additionally, **exploring the application of the proposed methods to other modalities**, such as audio and video, could broaden the scope of content moderation. Finally, **investigating the efficiency gains** possible through optimization techniques, such as model compression or quantization, and exploring alternative MLLM architectures tailored for safety judgments are worthwhile pursuits.  The ultimate goal is to create a truly scalable, reliable, and unbiased image safety system.

This is because the model identifies bloodstains on the ground, leg, and feet, associating them with a throat slit due to existing biases in its training data.  This highlights a challenge in directly using LLMs for safety assessments without addressing their inherent biases.

> üîº This table compares the performance of the proposed method (CLUE) against existing fine-tuning based methods for image safety assessment.  Because the proposed method does not rely on human-labeled data, it's compared to models pre-trained on different datasets and then evaluated on the same test set (OS Bench). The key takeaway is that fine-tuning approaches struggle to generalize beyond the specific safety rules they were trained on, highlighting the advantage of CLUE's zero-shot capability.

> Table 3: Comparison to fine-tuning based baseline methods on distinguishing safe and unsafe images in OS Bench. Since our setting requires constructing the detector without human labeling, we compare our method to the default models trained on their respective datasets and inference on OS Bench. The key aim of this table is to show that existing fine-tuning-based methods lack generalizability beyond the safety rules used in training/fine-tuning.

> üîº This table lists seed prompts used to generate images for the Objective Safety Bench (OS Bench) dataset.  Seed prompts are initial prompts given to a text-to-image model to create both unsafe and safe images.  For each of several rules defined for image safety, there are two types of prompts: those designed to elicit unsafe images violating the rule and those designed to elicit safe images that closely approach but do not violate the rule.  The table is crucial because the OS Bench dataset was specifically created to address the lack of a benchmark dataset that uses objective rules for image safety assessment.
