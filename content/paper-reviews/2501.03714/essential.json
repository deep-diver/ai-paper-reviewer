Existing techniques, such as those using implicit or explicit deformation or extending to 4D Gaussians, face limitations in handling long durations and complex motion combinations, often resulting in blurry renderings or large model sizes.  These methods also frequently require pre-computed information like optical flow, limiting their practical applicability. \nTo address these issues, the authors propose MoDec-GS, a novel framework that employs a global-to-local motion decomposition. **This method efficiently captures dynamic motions through Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) for coarse global movements and Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) for fine-grained local motions**.  Furthermore, **Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) automatically optimizes temporal segments during training, eliminating the need for pre-computed data**. MoDec-GS demonstrates significant improvements in memory efficiency (up to 70% reduction) and visual quality compared to state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its effectiveness in handling complex motion scenarios.", "affiliation": "Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.03714/podcast.wav"}
