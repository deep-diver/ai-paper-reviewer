This approach often struggles to capture spatial dependencies effectively within video frames.  Prior work has attempted to resolve this by using methods like multi-token prediction, but these methods either introduce additional modules or impose significant constraints, thus hindering their effectiveness and scalability.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel semi-autoregressive framework called Next-Block Prediction (NBP) that addresses these limitations. Instead of predicting individual tokens, NBP predicts entire blocks of tokens simultaneously.  This parallelization significantly reduces the number of generation steps, leading to faster inference.  NBP also employs bidirectional attention within each block to better capture spatial dependencies. Experiments demonstrate that NBP significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both speed and generation quality, achieving speed-ups exceeding 11 times on standard benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.07737/podcast.wav"}
