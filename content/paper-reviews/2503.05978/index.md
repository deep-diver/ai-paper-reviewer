### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Traditional portrait animation methods struggle with motion accuracy, rendering quality, and temporal coherence. To address these issues, **MagicInfinite** is introduced, a novel diffusion Transformer framework that delivers **high-fidelity results** across diverse characters, facial poses, and speaking scenarios. It enables **infinite video generation** with temporal coherence using 3D full-attention and a sliding window denoising strategy and supports precise speaker designation in multi-character scenes. 



The paper also addresses the challenge of integrating audio and text for realistic animation by proposing a **two-stage curriculum learning scheme.** It uses region-specific masks and adaptive loss functions to balance global textual control and local audio guidance for speaker-specific animations. The efficiency is enhanced via unified step and CFG distillation techniques, achieving a **20x inference speed boost.** MagicInfinite demonstrates superiority in audio-lip synchronization, identity preservation, and motion naturalness.

> üîº This table summarizes a user study designed to compare the video quality produced by three different portrait animation models: Hallo3, SadTalker, and MagicInfinite.  Participants viewed videos generated by each model for the same input portrait images and audio/text prompts and rated them based on five criteria.  These criteria assess the accuracy of lip-sync, the likeness of the generated character to the input image, the smoothness of the animation, the realism of the character movements, and the realism of any scene changes within the videos.  The responses were used to evaluate and compare the overall quality of each method.

### In-depth insights


#### Infinite Avatars
The concept of "Infinite Avatars" suggests a future where digital representations are limitless in creation and customization. **AI-driven tools could generate avatars endlessly**, adapting to diverse styles and characteristics. **Personalization would reach unprecedented levels**, allowing users to embody any persona imaginable. Challenges include maintaining identity consistency and preventing misuse. **Scalability and ethical considerations** are crucial, demanding robust frameworks for content moderation and responsible AI development.

#### 3D Full-Attention
**3D Full-Attention** emerges as a pivotal mechanism to enhance both spatial and temporal coherence in video synthesis. By attending to all tokens across frames, it captures intricate dependencies, crucial for realistic motion. Its integration addresses limitations of prior methods, particularly in complex scenarios like non-frontal faces or high-resolution video, where weak frame correspondence often leads to artifacts. It's a cornerstone for high-fidelity video generation, ensuring visual quality and temporal consistency, outperforming methods with separate spatial and temporal processing. This approach allows the model to better learn the fine-grained control of audio over lip movements.

#### Curriculum Learn
Curriculum learning in the context of talking head generation is a smart training strategy. **Starting with simpler tasks** like text-to-video generation lets the model grasp the basics without audio interference. The model then **gradually incorporates audio**, focusing on lip sync with a face region mask and adaptive loss. This ensures the model **prioritizes audio cues** locally while maintaining global textual control. This two-stage approach prevents the model from overlooking audio nuances. **Fine-grained lip movements**, are often neglected when training with both text and audio simultaneously due to the text's stronger influence on overall video content. This curriculum **balances text and audio influence**, leading to better lip synchronization and more natural-sounding talking heads. This addresses a key challenge in multi-modal talking head generation.

#### DMD2 Distillation
DMD2 is presented as a key component for accelerating diffusion model inference. Traditional diffusion models suffer from slow inference speeds due to the iterative sampling process. The paper adopts DMD2 which is validated across image diffusion models to enable accelerated sampling. The approach eliminates MagicInfinite's reliance on CFG during the step distillation process in DMD2, reducing NFEs. To circumvent GPU memory constraints, LoRA is used to update the parameters of the fake data distribution estimator, for efficient training. DMD2 helps to produce high-quality videos. The framework utilizes a curriculum learning strategy to reduce base loss weight and increase the SDS loss weight for effective learning. It leverages CFG during inference, applying two-fold CFG to timesteps 0.75-1 and three-fold CFG to timesteps 0-0.75. **Collaboration of DMD and CFG achieved good results**. 

#### Portrait Fidelity
The paper focuses on **generating high-fidelity talking head videos** that maintain the subject's identity. This is addressed through the use of a pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to encode the static portrait image, ensuring that the generated video retains the likeness and background context from the initial image. The paper also implements a **curriculum learning scheme** with a face region mask and adaptive loss function. This approach helps the model prioritize local facial movements and lip synchronization without sacrificing overall portrait fidelity. The user study shows that the majority of the participants agreed that the generated videos by the proposed approach were more realisitic and vivid.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the architecture of the MagicInfinite model, a hybrid dual-to-single-stream diffusion model.  The process begins with a static portrait image and textual prompt. A Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) encodes this information into tokens. Simultaneously, the audio input is processed by Wav2Vec, and an audio encoder adjusts the sampling rate. A face region mask guides the audio processing to focus on lip synchronization.  These tokens (text and audio) are combined and fed into a text-to-video (T2V) model. This model is refined through denoising steps with audio cross-attention incorporated in the final blocks to ensure precise lip synchronization.  The output is a high-fidelity, talking-head video.

> üîº This figure illustrates the architecture of the modified DMD2 model used for efficient inference.  The key improvements are a curriculum learning strategy that smoothly transitions between different loss functions (base loss and SDS loss), preventing instability during training.  Additionally, a two-fold to three-fold CFG (classifier-free guidance) attenuation method is used during the calculation of the real data distribution. This refinement significantly improves the motion dynamics and quality of the generated video, enabling more fluid and natural movement.
