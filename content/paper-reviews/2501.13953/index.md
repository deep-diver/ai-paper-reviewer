### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The rapid growth of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to a surge in the number of benchmarks, resulting in significant redundancy. This paper identifies three key types of redundancy: within benchmark dimensions, across instances within a benchmark, and across benchmarks in the same domain.  These redundancies hinder efficient model evaluation and distort research priorities.

This research responds by introducing a framework to quantify redundancy using correlation metrics applied to MLLM performance rankings.  The framework was tested on hundreds of MLLMs across multiple benchmarks.  The study revealed high redundancy in instances and benchmark dimensions, particularly for lower performing models. The authors propose design principles for more effective benchmarks which promote independence, optimal instance counts, and representativeness and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy effectively.

> üîº This figure illustrates the concept of redundancy in Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks from two perspectives.  The left side ('Where Redundancy Exists?') shows how redundancy can manifest in different aspects of benchmark design: overlapping capabilities across different dimensions within a benchmark (e.g., multiple dimensions measure similar aspects of an MLLM), redundant instances (repeated or very similar questions/tasks), and redundancy across multiple benchmarks targeting the same domain (different benchmarks covering similar ground). The right side ('Why Evaluate Redundancy?') highlights the problems caused by redundancy in benchmarks: lack of independence between evaluations (results are not truly independent), inefficiencies (repeated assessments of similar capabilities), and a potentially biased view of MLLM progress (overemphasis on certain capabilities due to frequent evaluation).  The figure uses a visual metaphor of overlapping circles and a red 'X' to represent the issues of redundancy.

### In-depth insights


#### Benchmark Redundancy
Benchmark redundancy, a critical issue in evaluating multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), arises from the proliferation of benchmarks assessing overlapping capabilities.  **This redundancy leads to inefficient use of resources and potentially skewed research priorities.** The paper systematically analyzes this redundancy across three key aspects: dimensions (intra-benchmark overlap in what is measured), instances (repetitive questions or tasks), and cross-benchmark redundancy (overlapping objectives across different benchmarks).  **A key finding is that redundancy is more prominent among lower-performing models**, suggesting that higher-performing models demonstrate greater differentiation in their capabilities and therefore show less redundancy in their assessment.  The study proposes a framework to quantify redundancy across these three aspects, recommending strategies to optimize benchmark design by fostering independence of dimensions, achieving optimal instance counts, and ensuring domain representativeness.  **By addressing benchmark redundancy, researchers can promote efficiency, enhance the evaluation of MLLMs, and avoid misinterpretations** stemming from overemphasis on certain tasks. The principles and framework presented offer valuable guidance for the development of more effective and meaningful benchmarks for MLLM evaluation.

#### Redundancy Framework
The Redundancy Framework section likely details a systematic approach to quantifying and addressing redundancy in Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks.  It probably introduces **metrics** to measure redundancy across three key aspects: dimensions (intra-benchmark), instances (intra-benchmark), and cross-benchmark redundancy.  The framework might use correlation coefficients (Spearman's Rank Correlation, Pearson's Linear Correlation, and R-squared) to assess the similarity of model performance rankings across different dimensions or instances.  A high correlation suggests substantial redundancy, indicating potential areas for streamlining or refinement. The framework likely discusses how to interpret these metrics and uses them to guide benchmark design.  Crucially, it would likely cover **methods** for identifying redundant dimensions or instances and propose strategies for mitigating these issues such as reducing the number of instances or consolidating overlapping dimensions. The overall goal is to develop more efficient and effective benchmarks by minimizing redundant evaluations and maximizing the insights gained.

#### MMBench Case Study
A hypothetical 'MMBench Case Study' within a research paper would likely involve a detailed analysis of the MMBench benchmark's properties and performance. This would require a thorough examination of MMBench's design, including its constituent dimensions, to assess the extent of redundancy present.  The study would probably segment MLLMs into performance tiers (e.g., top-performing vs. bottom-performing models), exploring how redundancy manifests differently across these groups. **Key findings might reveal that redundancy is more prevalent among lower-performing models**, indicating that higher-performing models demonstrate greater diversity in their capabilities. The case study would likely analyze the correlations between different MMBench dimensions, using metrics like Spearman's Rank Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) to quantify the level of overlap.  **Visualizations, such as heatmaps, might be used to illustrate the relationships between dimensions,** making it easier to identify highly correlated task clusters within the benchmark.  Furthermore, the study might discuss implications for benchmark design, suggesting strategies to refine MMBench and reduce redundancy in future iterations.  **Recommendations might include consolidating redundant dimensions, optimizing the number of instances in the benchmark, and ensuring that the benchmark adequately covers the entire range of MLLM capabilities.** Ultimately, a well-executed MMBench case study would provide valuable insights into the current state of MLLM benchmarks, offering practical guidance for developing more efficient and effective evaluation tools.

#### Redundancy Analysis
Redundancy analysis in the context of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks is crucial for efficient evaluation.  The core idea is to identify and mitigate overlaps in benchmark capabilities, test instances, and evaluations across different benchmarks.  **The analysis focuses on three key aspects:** redundancy across dimensions (intra-benchmark), redundancy across instances (intra-benchmark), and cross-benchmark redundancy. The proposed framework uses correlation metrics such as SRCC, PLCC, and R-squared to quantify redundancy.  **A key finding highlights the difference in redundancy levels between top-performing and bottom-performing MLLMs.** Top-performing models reveal less redundancy as they demonstrate more distinct capabilities and performance variations across tasks.  **Addressing redundancy improves efficiency by reducing duplicated effort and offers insights into optimal benchmark design**, ensuring adequate coverage of MLLM capabilities without unnecessary overlaps.  **The framework suggests strategies for optimizing benchmark design including instance count and dimension selection**, promoting independence while maintaining evaluation validity.  Ultimately, redundancy analysis contributes to the creation of more efficient and representative MLLM benchmarks that truly capture model capabilities and drive future progress.

#### Future Directions
Future research could **explore more nuanced forms of redundancy**, moving beyond simple correlation analysis to investigate the underlying cognitive processes assessed by different benchmark tasks.  A deeper understanding of **task decomposition and inter-task dependencies** would enable the creation of benchmarks that are both efficient and comprehensive, capturing the full spectrum of MLLM capabilities without unnecessary repetition.  Furthermore,  **developing standardized metrics and evaluation frameworks for redundancy** across various benchmark types and domains is crucial.  This would ensure the consistency and reliability of redundancy analysis, fostering greater comparability and facilitating more meaningful progress in the field.  Finally, future work should investigate how **benchmark redundancy affects various downstream applications** of MLLMs, such as in real-world deployment and societal impact assessments, to gain a more holistic understanding of the implications of redundancy in MLLM evaluation.

> üîº This heatmap visualizes the redundancy among the top 50 dimensions in the MMBench benchmark using the Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC). Each cell represents the PLCC between two dimensions, indicating the level of redundancy. Darker red cells denote higher redundancy, suggesting strong correlation in MLLM performance rankings across those dimensions, whereas lighter blue cells represent lower redundancy and less correlated performance. This visualization helps identify sets of dimensions that may be evaluating similar capabilities of MLLMs, potentially pointing towards areas for optimization and refinement of the benchmark.

> üîº This heatmap visualizes the redundancy among the top 50 performing dimensions of the MMBench benchmark, specifically focusing on the R-squared (R2) correlation metric. Each cell represents the R2 correlation coefficient between two dimensions, indicating the extent to which their performance rankings across various multimodal language models (MLLMs) are correlated.  Warmer colors (red) show higher correlation signifying greater redundancy (i.e., the two dimensions measure similar capabilities) and cooler colors (blue) represent lower correlation and less redundancy.

> üîº This heatmap visualizes the redundancy among the bottom 50 performing Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in terms of their Pearson Linear Correlation Coefficient (PLCC) scores across different dimensions of the MMBench benchmark. Each cell's color intensity represents the PLCC between two dimensions, indicating their level of redundancy. Darker colors signify higher redundancy, implying that the models' performance across those two dimensions is strongly correlated. Lighter colors represent lower redundancy. This visualization helps understand which dimensions measure similar aspects of MLLM capabilities, highlighting potential areas for improvement in benchmark design.

> üîº This figure displays heatmaps and bar plots illustrating the redundancy among dimensions within the AI2D benchmark, separately analyzed for the top-performing 50 and bottom-performing 50 Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).  The heatmaps visualize the correlation between different dimensions, indicating the degree of overlap in the capabilities they assess.  The bar plots summarize the overall redundancy for each dimension.  The analysis helps to identify redundant dimensions that could be consolidated or removed to improve benchmark efficiency and provide more independent insights into MLLM capabilities.
