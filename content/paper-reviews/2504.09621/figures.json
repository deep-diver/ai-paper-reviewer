(a) Downsampling: This method reduces the image resolution to fit within memory constraints. While efficient, it results in a loss of important high-frequency details, reducing image quality. (b) Image Slicing: This technique divides a large image into smaller overlapping patches, processes each individually, and stitches them together. While enabling the processing of larger inputs, it compromises global contextual information and object coherence, leading to artifacts at patch boundaries.

It begins by partitioning the hazy image into uniform-sized patches, which are then encoded into tokens by the Encoder. The Bottleneck injects global information into each token, enhancing the contextual representation. Subsequently, the Decoder reconstructs the tokens back into image patches, forming the final output image. Notably, to minimize memory consumption, both the Encoder and Decoder employ an asynchronous processing strategy, handling the input in multiple mini-batches sequentially rather than simultaneously. This design optimizes memory efficiency while ensuring effective haze removal.", "description": "DehazeXL, the proposed model, processes large hazy images efficiently by dividing them into uniform patches.  These patches are encoded into tokens by the encoder, then a bottleneck module injects global context into each token to improve contextual understanding.
