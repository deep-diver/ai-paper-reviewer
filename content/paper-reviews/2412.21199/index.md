### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on isolated code generation tasks. This approach doesn't accurately reflect real-world coding scenarios that often demand complex reasoning and the ability to utilize previously generated code to tackle more complex issues. This paper introduces three new benchmarks, HumanEval Pro, MBPP Pro, and BigCodeBench-Lite Pro, which are designed to evaluate LLMs on a new task called "self-invoking code generation".  In this task, LLMs must solve a simple problem and then use its solution to address a related, more complex problem. 

The study evaluates twenty LLMs across these benchmarks. The results reveal that while LLMs often perform well on the standard code generation benchmarks, their performance significantly drops in the self-invoking tasks. Additionally, the researchers find that instruction-tuned models, which are specifically trained to follow instructions, exhibit only marginal improvements compared to their base models in the self-invoking code generation task. The failure analysis reveals that difficulties in utilizing self-generated code and handling logical inconsistencies are major factors leading to the performance drop.  The paper's findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and point towards the need for improvements in LLM training methods.

> üîº The figure illustrates the self-invoking code generation task.  Given a simple base problem and a more complex problem that relies on the solution of the base problem, the model must solve the base problem first and then use its solution (or a function from its solution) to address the second, more complex problem. This tests the model's ability to not only generate code but also to use previously-generated code in a progressive problem-solving manner.

### In-depth insights


#### Self-Invoking Code
The concept of "Self-Invoking Code" presents a novel approach to evaluating large language models (LLMs) by assessing their ability to not only generate code but also utilize previously generated code to solve progressively complex problems.  This paradigm shift from isolated code generation tasks to more realistic, multi-step problem-solving scenarios offers a more nuanced and robust evaluation metric. **The core idea is to challenge LLMs with a base problem and then a subsequent, more complex problem that explicitly requires leveraging the solution of the first**. This effectively tests not just code generation capabilities but also the LLM's understanding, modification, and application of its own generated code.  The results highlight a significant performance drop for many LLMs when transitioning from traditional isolated tasks to self-invoking tasks, underscoring the limitations of current models and the need for more sophisticated reasoning abilities. This research emphasizes **the importance of moving beyond simplistic benchmark evaluations towards more complex, realistic scenarios** that better reflect the challenges faced in real-world software development. The 'Self-Invoking Code' evaluation approach therefore provides valuable insights into the current limitations of LLMs and points to a promising direction for future research focusing on enhancing code reasoning capabilities and progressive problem-solving.

#### LLM Reasoning
LLM reasoning, a critical aspect of large language model capabilities, remains a complex and multifaceted area of research.  **Current benchmarks often fall short in evaluating the true reasoning abilities of LLMs**, focusing on isolated tasks rather than the progressive, multi-step reasoning required in real-world scenarios.  The capacity for self-invoking code generation, which necessitates generating a solution and then using that solution to solve a more complex related problem, is a prime example. **Studies show that while LLMs excel in isolated code generation tasks, their performance significantly degrades when required to reason progressively.**  Instruction tuning, a popular method to improve LLM performance, demonstrates only marginal improvements in self-invoking tasks compared to base models.  This suggests a need to move beyond simple benchmarks and develop new evaluation metrics that accurately assess complex multi-step reasoning.  **Further research is needed to explore failure modes, such as difficulties with understanding function calls or handling edge cases, and improve training methodologies to enhance true reasoning capabilities.**  Ultimately, the pursuit of superior LLM reasoning is about creating models capable of genuine problem-solving, not just pattern matching.

#### Benchmarking LLMs
Benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for evaluating their capabilities and identifying areas for improvement.  **Effective benchmarks should go beyond simple metrics like accuracy, and instead assess LLMs on tasks that reflect real-world applications.**  This includes evaluating their ability to handle complex reasoning, nuanced instructions, and diverse data formats.  **Bias detection and mitigation are also crucial aspects that benchmarks should consider.**  While existing benchmarks like GLUE and SuperGLUE have contributed valuable insights, **there's an ongoing need for benchmarks tailored to specific LLM applications**, such as code generation, translation, or question answering. **The design of a good benchmark requires careful consideration of task selection, metric choice, and data diversity, aiming for both breadth and depth.** This holistic approach ensures a fair and informative assessment, promoting progress in the field while highlighting limitations that need further research.

#### Instruction Tuning
Instruction tuning, a crucial technique in enhancing large language models (LLMs), involves fine-tuning pre-trained models on a dataset of instruction-response pairs. This method significantly improves the models' ability to follow instructions and generate desired outputs.  **The effectiveness of instruction tuning hinges on the quality and diversity of the instruction dataset.**  A well-crafted dataset with varied instructions and corresponding high-quality responses is paramount for optimal performance.  **Instruction tuning demonstrably improves performance on downstream tasks, particularly those requiring complex reasoning or multi-step problem solving.** This is because instruction tuning bridges the gap between the model's internal knowledge and its ability to apply this knowledge in response to specific instructions. However, **instruction tuning's benefits are not universal.** There are limitations; for instance, the improvement might be task-specific, and the model may still struggle with novel or ambiguous instructions. **Future research should focus on creating larger and more diverse instruction datasets, exploring more sophisticated training methodologies, and investigating ways to enhance the models' robustness to challenging or unforeseen instructions.**  Ultimately, instruction tuning remains a powerful tool in the ongoing development of more capable and adaptable LLMs.

#### Future Work
The paper's 'Future Work' section would greatly benefit from expanding the scope of programming languages beyond Python.  **Addressing the limitations of relying solely on Python datasets** is crucial for broader applicability and generalizability.  Furthermore, the current self-invoking problem set, while challenging, could be significantly improved by **introducing a more diverse range of problems** to ensure a robust evaluation of LLMs' reasoning abilities.  This could involve incorporating more real-world scenarios and complexities found in software development.  Another crucial area for improvement lies in **developing more sophisticated evaluation metrics** that go beyond simple pass/fail rates and delve into the qualitative aspects of generated code.   Analyzing specific failure modes and identifying the underlying reasons for model shortcomings will further enhance the benchmarks' effectiveness. Lastly, **exploring the potential of incorporating multilingual datasets** would significantly expand the research's scope, making it more relevant in today's increasingly globalized software landscape.

The self-invoking nature of BigCodeBench-Lite Pro adds a layer of complexity compared to the original BigCodeBench-Lite, requiring LLMs to not only generate code but also effectively utilize previously generated functions to solve more intricate problems.  Section G.6 provides an example of a problem from the BigCodeBench-Lite Pro dataset.

> üîº This table presents the performance of various large language models (LLMs) on HumanEval Pro and MBPP Pro, which are more challenging benchmarks designed to assess the progressive reasoning and problem-solving capabilities of LLMs through self-invoking code generation tasks.  The results show the pass rate (@1, @5, @10) for each model, indicating the percentage of times the model generated a correct solution within the top 1, 5, or 10 predictions. The evaluation methodology involves generating 20 samples per problem using a random sampling strategy with a temperature of 0.2 and top_p of 0.95 to ensure diversity and robustness in the results.
