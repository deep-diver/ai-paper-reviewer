It evaluates agents replicating 20 ICML 2024 papers from scratch, requiring understanding paper contributions, codebase development, and experiment execution. The process faces challenges in autonomous capabilities, safety assurance, and the need for scalable evaluation methods due to manual grading complexities.\n\nTo tackle the issues, the paper introduces rubrics that hierarchically decompose replication tasks into gradable sub-tasks and uses LLM-based judges for automated grading. Results from evaluating several frontier models reveal that even the best-performing agents are not yet outperforming human baselines in replicating ML research, emphasizing that there is a need for future research to boost AI engineering abilities of AI agents.
