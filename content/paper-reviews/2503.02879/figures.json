The researchers directly analyzed the impact of LLMs on Wikipedia by examining changes in page views, word frequency, and linguistic style.  They also explored the indirect impact on the broader NLP community by assessing how LLMs might affect machine translation benchmarks and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, which rely heavily on Wikipedia data.  The core question is whether LLMs have already altered Wikipedia and what future risks and consequences might arise.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.02879/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Monthly page views across different Wikipedia categories.

To facilitate comparison across categories with differing scales of page view numbers, the raw page view data has been transformed using the Inverse Hyperbolic Sine (IHS) function, which standardizes the values.

Each line represents a specific category (Art, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, etc.) and plots the frequency of the word \"crucial\" within those articles. The x-axis represents the year (2020-2025) and the y-axis shows the frequency (per 1000 words).
