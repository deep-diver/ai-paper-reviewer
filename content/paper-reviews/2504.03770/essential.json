Existing jailbreak detection methods face challenges, such as **reliance on model hidden states, computational overhead from uncertainty-based analysis, and the requirement of fully labeled harmful datasets**, which are often scarce in real-world settings. Addressing these issues is critical to ensuring the responsible deployment of MLLMs. \n\nThis paper introduces JAILDAM, a **test-time adaptive framework** that uses a memory-based approach guided by policy-driven unsafe knowledge representations. This framework improves generalization to unseen jailbreak strategies while maintaining efficiency. JAILDAM delivers **state-of-the-art performance in harmful content detection**, improving both accuracy and speed. It ensures robust handling of new jailbreak strategies that emerge post-deployment.", "affiliation": "University of Southern California", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Safety"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03770/podcast.wav"}
