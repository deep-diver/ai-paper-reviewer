It aims to encourage robust algorithms that can handle diverse, time-varying visual conditions. This year\u2019s challenge features two tracks: MOSE, which centers on complex scene video object segmentation, and MeViS, targeting motion-guided, language-based video segmentation. The new datasets are designed to better reflect real-world scenarios, offering valuable insights into complex video segmentation. \n\nThe challenge employs state-of-the-art methodologies to offer a benchmark for evaluating models. A range of approaches were used including multi-model inference to process frames independently, **adaptive pseudo-labeling** to create comprehensive baselines and dynamic model recommendation. Top solutions leveraged models like SAM2 and TMO, fine-tuning them for complex environments.  The benchmarks and comprehensive analysis provide valuable insights and suggest future directions in complex video segmentation.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.11326/podcast.wav"}
