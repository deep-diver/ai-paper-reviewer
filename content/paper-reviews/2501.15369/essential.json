Current convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel in speed but lack the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViTs), which are too computationally expensive for mobile deployment.  Hybrid approaches attempt to bridge this gap, but often compromise either speed or accuracy. \nThis research introduces iFormer, a new hybrid network architecture that overcomes these limitations.  It leverages the strengths of both CNNs (ConvNeXt specifically) and ViTs, but with a crucial improvement: a novel single-head modulation attention mechanism significantly reduces the computational cost of self-attention.  Extensive experiments demonstrate iFormer's superiority over existing mobile models in both accuracy and speed across various image classification, detection, and segmentation tasks, proving its efficiency and effectiveness in real-world mobile applications.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2501.15369/podcast.wav"}
