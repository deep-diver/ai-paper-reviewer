However, implementing such training at scale can be challenging. The paper introduces Open-Reasoner-Zero that addresses scalability, simplicity, and accessibility. The approach focuses on training LLMs to master diverse reasoning skills under verifiable rewards. \n\nThe work presents a minimalist approach using vanilla PPO with straightforward rule-based rewards. It achieves strong performance on benchmarks like AIME2024 and MATH500. **The key is scaling data quantity and diversity, rather than complex algorithms**. The authors open-source their implementation, including code, models, and training data. This should enable broader participation in LLM training.", "affiliation": "StepFun", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.24290/podcast.wav"}
