### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

**Creating realistic 3D human avatars from text descriptions is challenging, especially when it comes to hair.**  Current methods often represent hair as a solid mass, lacking the detail and flexibility of real hair strands.  This makes it difficult to create diverse hairstyles or simulate realistic hair movement.  Existing strand-based hair modeling techniques either rely on complex multi-view image setups or struggle with the controllability needed for generating hair from user-provided text. 

**This paper introduces StrandHead, a new approach to generate detailed 3D head avatars with strand-based, textured hair from just text prompts.** It bypasses the need for 3D hair training data by leveraging pre-trained 2D image generation models.  A novel "differentiable prismatization" algorithm efficiently converts individual hair strands into 3D meshes suitable for detailed modeling.  Furthermore, StrandHead incorporates specific geometric properties of hair into its learning process, resulting in more realistic and robust hairstyle generation. This allows for flexible editing, hairstyle transfer, and even physics-based rendering and simulations.

### In-depth insights


#### Hair Avatar Gen.
**StrandHead** introduces a novel approach to generating 3D head avatars with **disentangled, strand-based hair**, driven by text prompts. Unlike existing methods that represent hair as holistic meshes or NeRFs, StrandHead captures the **internal geometric structure of individual hair strands**, enabling **realistic rendering, simulation, and editing**.  This is achieved through distilling knowledge from 2D generative diffusion models, leveraging **geometric priors** and eliminating the need for 3D hair training data.  Key innovations include a **differentiable prismatization algorithm** for converting strands to meshes, and **consistency/curvature regularization losses** ensuring realistic hair shapes. Results show **state-of-the-art** realism and diversity in generated 3D heads and hairstyles, unlocking new possibilities for avatar creation and manipulation.

#### Strand-Based Hair
**Strand-based hair modeling** represents a significant advancement in 3D avatar creation.  Unlike traditional methods that treat hair as a single mesh, this approach focuses on individual strands, enabling **greater realism and control**.  By manipulating individual strand parameters like **length, curvature, and color**, highly detailed and diverse hairstyles can be achieved.  This level of detail opens doors to a wide range of applications, including **realistic hair simulation, dynamic styling, and personalized avatar creation**.  Strand-based hair also facilitates **deeper integration with physics engines**, allowing for believable hair movement and interaction with the environment.  The **computational cost** associated with strand-based hair can be significant, particularly for complex hairstyles, but ongoing advancements in rendering and optimization techniques continue to mitigate this challenge. This method's **disentanglement capabilities** further enhance hairstyle editing and transfer, marking a key step toward truly realistic digital humans.

#### 2D Diffusion Prior
**2D Diffusion Priors** offer a compelling approach to generating complex 3D structures like hair, leveraging the power of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models.  These models excel at capturing intricate details and textures in 2D, which can be **distilled** into 3D representations. This avoids the need for large, labeled 3D datasets, a major bottleneck in 3D generative tasks.  However, directly applying 2D priors to 3D poses challenges. Novel techniques, such as **differentiable prismatization**, are essential for bridging the gap between 2D and 3D, transforming 2D information into a suitable format for 3D modeling and rendering.  Furthermore, incorporating geometric and statistical priors about hair structure, such as strand orientation and curvature, ensures **realistic** and **controllable** 3D hair generation.  By combining the richness of 2D diffusion models with specific 3D knowledge, this approach holds significant potential for creating realistic and diverse 3D avatars.

#### Geometric Priors
**Geometric priors** provide crucial constraints for generating realistic 3D hair.  StrandHead leverages these priors in several ways. First, the **cylindrical structure of hair** inspires a differentiable prismatization algorithm, converting strands into watertight meshes for robust modeling.  This allows for detailed strand-level manipulation and integration with physics engines. Second, **hair orientation consistency** is enforced, ensuring neighboring strands align realistically. Third, **curvature regularization** controls the overall hair shape, preventing unnatural configurations and aligning with user prompts. These priors work together to significantly enhance realism and controllability.

#### Hair Editing & Sim.
**Hair editing and simulation** are crucial aspects of creating realistic and interactive digital avatars.  Strand-based hair representations enable fine-grained control over individual strands, allowing for **realistic styling and dynamic movement**. Physics-based simulation, using techniques like the finite element method, adds to the realism by **emulating the natural behavior of hair under various forces**, such as gravity and wind.  Furthermore, accurate collision detection and response between hair and other objects or body parts are essential for **avoiding unrealistic intersections and maintaining visual fidelity**. Advanced rendering techniques are necessary to capture the complex light interactions within hair, accounting for scattering, absorption, and reflection.  Integrating these features into hair editing and simulation pipelines empowers users to **create highly personalized and dynamic hairstyles** within various interactive applications, such as virtual reality, gaming, and character animation.  The computational cost associated with high-fidelity hair simulation remains a **challenge**.

> üîº StrandHead's pipeline consists of two main stages: (a) Bald Head Generation: This stage generates a detailed and realistic bald head model. It uses a human-specific diffusion model with a FLAME-evolving prior loss to ensure the head's fidelity and prevent unnatural geometries.  Normal and depth adapted diffusion models are utilized, combined with a prior loss related to FLAME parameters. A texture field is also used to model head appearance. (b) Strand-Based Hair Generation: Leveraging the generated bald head, this stage creates realistic strand-based hair using a novel differentiable prismatization algorithm.  This algorithm converts hair strands to watertight prismatic meshes, allowing the use of mesh-based renderers and losses.  Orientation consistency and curvature regularization losses, inspired by hair geometric priors, ensure realistic and diverse hair generation without requiring 3D hair training data. A strand-aware texture field models high-frequency color variations and accounts for strand orientation.

> üîº This figure illustrates the process of converting a single hair strand into a watertight octagonal prism mesh using the proposed differentiable prismatization algorithm.  The algorithm takes a strand of hair as input and outputs a 3D mesh that can be used for rendering and other hair modeling tasks. It does this by generating a set of normals around the hair strand and then translating the strand along these normals to create the lateral edges of the prism. This method is efficient and flexible, allowing for meshes with different numbers of sides and thickness, and its differentiable nature allows for use in deep learning tasks.

> üîº This figure visualizes the distribution of cosine similarity of adjacent hair strand orientations (CS_ori) and the average curvature (C_mean) across 343 hairstyles in the USC-HairSalon dataset.  Two key observations are highlighted: (1) High Consistency of Neighboring Strand Orientations: The distribution of CS_ori reveals that over 95% of hairstyles exhibit a cosine similarity greater than 0.9, indicating a strong tendency for neighboring strands to align in similar directions.  (2) Strong Correlation between Curvature and Curliness: The distribution of C_mean demonstrates a clear positive correlation with the perceived curliness of the hairstyle.  Hairstyles with higher average curvatures tend to appear curlier.  This analysis supports the introduction of orientation consistency and curvature regularization losses in the proposed StrandHead model to ensure the generation of realistic and plausible 3D hairstyles from textual descriptions.  Examples of hairstyles with varying CS_ori and C_mean values are also included to further illustrate these observations.

TECA's rendering lacks normals due to its use of vanilla NeRF for hair representation.  HAAR only generates hair strand geometry; for comparison, these strands were converted into prismatic meshes and textured using differentiable prismatization and TEXTure.
