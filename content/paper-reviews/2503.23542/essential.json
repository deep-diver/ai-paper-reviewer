{"importance": "This research matters because it **boosts ASR for under-represented languages**, making tech more inclusive. It **shows how combining classic and new language models improves accuracy** and robustness. Also, it **spotlights key ASR settings** often overlooked and needed for fair comparisons, thus **advancing future ASR** research.", "summary": "Whisper-LM improves ASR models for low-resource languages by integrating language models, significantly reducing word error rate.", "takeaways": ["Integrating language models with fine-tuned Whisper models significantly improves ASR accuracy, especially for low-resource languages.", "Both n-gram and large language models enhance ASR robustness, with LLMs offering more consistent gains across diverse linguistic contexts.", "Careful selection of evaluation parameters is crucial for accurately assessing ASR model performance."], "tldr": "Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has improved via multilingual models like Whisper, but struggles with nuances of low-resource languages. This paper tackles this issue by integrating traditional and novel language models into fine-tuned Whisper models, rigorously evaluating them across datasets and parameters to improve performance. The goal is **bridging the gap** between phonetic encoding and syntactic structures to improve out-of-distribution robustness.\n\nThe study integrates language models not via prompting but by merging internal scores at inference, mitigating domain shifts, and introducing a metric (ERER) for performance scaling from in- to out-of-distribution scenarios. Results show n-gram and large language models **substantially improve OOD performance**, also scrutinizing evaluation parameters affecting ASR results. Key is demonstrating enhanced accuracy and robustness in low-resource languages with weakly supervised acoustic ASR systems, offering insights into deep learning-based models with traditional language models.", "affiliation": "University of Basque Country", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Speech Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "2503.23542/podcast.wav"}
