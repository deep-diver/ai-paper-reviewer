Existing algorithms struggle with highly dynamic change areas, as they rely on single-phase training approaches which degrade when addressing scenarios with wide variations in change areas, ranging from no change to complete change.\n\nThis paper introduces the **JL1-CD dataset**, which contains 5,000 pairs of high-resolution images with diverse change scenarios. To improve performance in the diverse dataset, the paper presents a multi-teacher knowledge distillation (MTKD) framework with the **O-P strategy**, where models trained on partitions are served as teachers.  The student model achieves superior detection accuracy under the supervision of multiple teachers, establishing new state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.13407/podcast.wav"}
