### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for evaluating large language models (LLMs) in complex tool use scenarios are limited by the lack of reliable datasets.  Existing datasets often use a tool-driven approach, failing to ensure that tools are interconnected, that queries genuinely require multi-hop reasoning, and that the answers are verifiable. This leads to biased evaluations and unreliable insights.  

ToolHop introduces a novel query-driven approach to constructing a benchmark dataset.  It focuses on generating diverse multi-hop queries first and then constructing tools to solve them, ensuring the interdependency of tools and the authenticity of the multi-hop nature of the queries. The project rigorously evaluates 14 LLMs across 5 model families. **The evaluation reveals substantial challenges in handling multi-hop tool use, with even state-of-the-art models achieving only moderate accuracy.** Detailed analysis of ToolHop offers actionable insights into the varying tool-use strategies employed by different LLM families, paving the way for the development of more efficient and robust LLM models.

> üîº This figure illustrates the multi-hop tool use process.  A complex user query is broken down into smaller, individual sub-queries. Each sub-query is then processed by invoking an appropriate tool. The tool's response (feedback) is used to inform subsequent sub-query processing, creating an iterative cycle. This continues until all sub-queries are answered and the final answer to the original, complex query is obtained. The process highlights the need for comprehension, reasoning, and the ability to properly call and manage external tools (functions).

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-hop Tool Use
Multi-hop tool use signifies a significant evolution in large language model (LLM) capabilities, demanding a more nuanced evaluation than previous single-step assessments.  **It necessitates LLMs to break down complex queries into smaller, manageable sub-queries**, executing a sequence of tools, and integrating intermediate results to reach the final answer.  This process showcases **advanced reasoning and comprehension skills**, including the ability to understand tool functionalities, select appropriate tools, and manage the flow of information.  The evaluation of multi-hop tool use thus requires **sophisticated benchmarks** which go beyond simple accuracy measures.  **Such benchmarks must account for the complex interplay of query decomposition, tool selection, error handling, and the overall reasoning chain**, highlighting not only the final result but also the intermediate steps and potential points of failure.  Therefore, **rigorous evaluation datasets** are crucial for advancing LLM research and development in this area, enabling the creation of more robust and intelligent systems.

#### Query-Driven Data
The concept of 'Query-Driven Data' introduces a paradigm shift in dataset creation, moving away from the traditional tool-centric approach.  Instead of assembling tools first and then generating queries, **this method prioritizes the user query**.  This ensures that the resulting dataset is directly relevant to practical user needs, **avoiding potential biases from tool selection**. The process then iteratively builds the necessary tools, documents, and code to address the query. This approach inherently creates interdependencies between tools, reflecting the complexities of real-world scenarios.  **A key strength is the inherent focus on multi-hop reasoning**. This iterative query-driven approach thus naturally generates multi-hop scenarios, reflecting how users often need to combine multiple tools to solve complex problems.  Further, the process naturally lends itself to creating verifiable answers, strengthening the dataset's robustness and enabling more rigorous evaluation of large language models (LLMs). Overall, 'Query-Driven Data' offers a **more realistic and effective approach** to benchmarking LLM capabilities in multi-hop tool use.

#### LLM Tool Use Gaps
The heading "LLM Tool Use Gaps" suggests an analysis of shortcomings in Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to effectively utilize external tools.  A comprehensive exploration would likely delve into **specific types of tool usage failures**, such as incorrect tool selection, misinterpretation of tool outputs, inability to handle multi-step processes (requiring multiple tools), and struggles with tools requiring complex or nuanced interactions.  **Performance comparisons across different LLM architectures** would be crucial, highlighting architectural strengths and weaknesses in tool integration.  Furthermore, the analysis should identify the **root causes of these gaps**, possibly including insufficient training data incorporating tool interactions, limitations in reasoning and planning capabilities, and inadequate mechanisms for error handling and recovery during tool usage.  Investigating the impact of various factors like **prompt engineering techniques** and **tool documentation quality** on LLM performance could reveal actionable strategies for improvement. Finally,  the section likely proposes potential solutions, perhaps focusing on **improved training methodologies** that incorporate diverse and complex tool usage scenarios, **architectural innovations** designed for more robust tool integration, and the development of **better evaluation metrics** specifically tailored for assessing LLMs' tool-use capabilities.

#### ToolHop Dataset
The ToolHop dataset represents a significant contribution to the field of large language model (LLM) evaluation, specifically focusing on multi-hop tool use.  Its **query-driven construction** is a key strength, ensuring that the tools are genuinely interdependent and the queries reflect real-world complexities. This contrasts sharply with prior tool-driven approaches which often resulted in artificial scenarios. The inclusion of **995 multi-hop queries and 3,912 associated tools**, along with **detailed feedback mechanisms and verifiable answers**, provides a robust and reliable benchmark. The diversity of queries across 47 domains, the careful refinement of tool documents and code implementations, and the emphasis on local executability all enhance the dataset's practical value. ToolHop's rigorous evaluation across 14 LLMs from five model families exposes the significant challenges remaining in multi-hop tool use, thus enabling more effective development of LLMs.

#### Future Directions
Future research directions for multi-hop tool use in large language models (LLMs) should prioritize **developing more robust and adaptable tool-use models** capable of handling diverse query types and complex tool interactions.  **Improving LLMs' understanding of user intent** is crucial to avoid errors stemming from incorrect tool selection or parameter usage.  Further investigation into **optimizing the balance between efficiency and accuracy in parallel tool calls** is needed, as current methods show a trade-off between the two.  **Detailed feedback mechanisms** are essential for enhancing LLMs' ability to learn from mistakes and refine their tool-use strategies.  Finally, exploring new evaluation methods beyond simple accuracy metrics to capture nuanced aspects of tool use performance, such as efficiency and reliability, is vital for comprehensive assessment.

The example shows a multi-hop query: 'What is the first letter of the first name of the father of the director of film Little Joe (Film) in lowercase?' The model initially makes an error when calling the family_relationship_finder tool because it's missing a required argument. However, after receiving detailed feedback, the model successfully corrects its error, and produces the correct answer. This demonstrates the model's ability to learn from detailed feedback and improve its performance in handling tool calls.
