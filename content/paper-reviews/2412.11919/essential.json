Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) addresses this by incorporating external knowledge, but current methods have limitations. They require separate retrieval models, add computational overhead, introduce redundant information, and lack joint optimization of retrieval and generation processes.  These issues hinder the performance and efficiency of LLMs in knowledge-intensive tasks.Existing RAG methods employ dense retrievers, resulting in high deployment costs and input token overload. Generative retrievers offer joint optimization potential but require mapping generated IDs back to content, disrupting seamless integration. Prefix constrained approaches suffer from false pruning issues due to excessive initial choices and limited future awareness, hindering correct evidence generation.  Improving RAG efficiency and accuracy requires addressing these limitations.\nRetroLLM integrates retrieval and generation into a single process within LLMs, generating evidence directly from the corpus using constrained decoding. It uses hierarchical FM-Index constraints to predict clues and identify a subset of candidate documents, reducing the decoding space and mitigating false pruning.  A forward-looking constrained decoding strategy enhances evidence accuracy by scoring future sequence relevance. By unifying retrieval and generation, **RetroLLM simplifies the RAG architecture, eliminates the need for separate embedding models, improves flexibility, and allows for joint optimization**.  The results demonstrate RetroLLM's superior performance across various QA datasets, **significantly reducing token consumption** compared to traditional RAG methods while maintaining **high accuracy**. This unified framework with enhanced decoding offers a promising direction for efficient and accurate retrieval-augmented generation.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2412.11919/podcast.wav"}
