While LLMs excel at many tasks, complex reasoning requires more advanced techniques than simple autoregressive text generation.  Existing methods heavily rely on expensive human annotation for training data, limiting scalability.  Moreover, test-time reasoning accuracy often remains unsatisfactory. \nThis paper offers a comprehensive overview of recent LLM reasoning advancements, focusing on approaches that tackle these limitations. It explores the use of reinforcement learning to create high-quality reasoning datasets automatically, reducing human annotation needs. The paper also examines test-time scaling techniques such as chain-of-thought and tree-of-thought prompting, and the utilization of Process Reward Models (PRMs) for guiding LLMs' reasoning process.  Finally, it reviews the groundbreaking OpenAI o1 series and several open-source projects working on similar large reasoning models, offering valuable insights into this rapidly evolving research area.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.09686/podcast.wav"}
