Existing methods often fall short in achieving truly believable lip movements, as they don't fully capture the subtle nuances of natural speech. Current evaluation metrics are also inadequate, focusing on geometric differences rather than perceptual accuracy. Datasets often lack the necessary range of expressions and speech intensities, further hindering progress in this field.\n\nTo address these limitations, this paper defines three key criteria for perceptually accurate lip synchronization: **Temporal Synchronization**, **Lip Readability**, and **Expressiveness**. A novel **speech-mesh representation** is introduced, capturing the intricate relationships between speech signals and 3D face meshes. The learned representation is used as a perceptual loss to improve existing 3D talking head generation models. New metrics, including Perceptual Lip Readability Score (PLRS), are also proposed for comprehensive evaluation. Experiments demonstrate significant improvements across all three criteria, leading to more realistic and engaging 3D talking heads.", "affiliation": "Grad.
