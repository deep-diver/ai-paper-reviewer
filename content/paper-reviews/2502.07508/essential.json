These models generate videos with unnatural transitions, blurry details, and lack of coherence between frames.  Existing enhancement methods primarily focus on UNet-based models, leaving DiT model improvement relatively unexplored.\nEnhance-A-Video tackles this problem with a novel, training-free approach.  **It enhances cross-frame correlations in DiT models by adjusting the distribution of temporal attention weights.** This method doesn't require retraining or additional parameters, making it easily integrated into existing DiT-based video generation frameworks.  Experimental results across multiple models demonstrate significant improvements in video quality, showcasing the effectiveness and adaptability of this simple yet impactful solution.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.07508/podcast.wav"}
