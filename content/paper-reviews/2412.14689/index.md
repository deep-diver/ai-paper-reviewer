### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

The widespread use of synthetic data in training large language models (LLMs) presents a significant challenge: **model collapse**, where iterative training on self-generated data leads to performance degradation.  This paper investigates the impact of synthetic data on LLMs and explores methods to synthesize data without causing model collapse. The authors find a negative correlation between the proportion of synthetic data and model performance, attributing this to distributional shift and feature over-concentration in synthetic datasets.

To address this challenge, the authors propose **token-level editing**, a novel approach that modifies human-produced data at a token level using a pre-trained language model to create semi-synthetic data. This method is theoretically proven to prevent model collapse by keeping the test error bounded. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of token-level editing across various training scenarios (pre-training from scratch, continual pre-training, and supervised fine-tuning), demonstrating improved model performance and data quality.

> üîº This figure illustrates the concept of model collapse when using synthetic data for training and proposes a solution. In the first part, it shows how continuous training on self-generated data leads to an increase in the test error, which is the characteristic of model collapse. The second part introduces a method called 'ToEdit', where a pre-trained model is used for token-level editing of existing data instead of generating entirely new data. This method aims to constrain the test error within a bounded range, thereby preventing model collapse and maintaining distribution coverage.

### In-depth insights


#### Synthetic Data Risks
Synthetic data, while offering advantages in data augmentation and privacy preservation, presents inherent risks.  **Model collapse**, where models overfit to synthetic data and lose generalization ability on real-world data, is a critical concern.  This often stems from **distributional shifts** between synthetic and real data, leading to performance degradation on downstream tasks.  Furthermore, the **quality of synthetic data** is paramount; poorly generated data can introduce biases and inaccuracies, impacting model fairness and reliability.  Addressing these risks requires careful consideration of data generation methods, rigorous evaluation metrics focusing on real-world performance, and potentially the incorporation of techniques to detect and mitigate distributional shifts.  **Continuous monitoring and validation** are also crucial to ensure synthetic data's ongoing suitability for training and avoid unintended consequences.

#### Token-Level Editing
The proposed method of token-level editing offers a novel approach to synthesizing high-quality training data for language models by directly modifying existing human-generated text instead of generating entirely new synthetic data. This approach directly addresses the issues of model collapse and data quality degradation often associated with purely synthetic datasets.  **The core concept involves using a pre-trained language model to identify tokens with high conditional probabilities, implying these are easily learned by the model.**  These tokens are then selectively replaced with tokens sampled from a prior distribution. **This process theoretically prevents model collapse by constraining the test error within a bounded range** and prevents overfitting to specific features, enhancing generalization capabilities.  The efficacy of this method is supported by theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across various model training stages, highlighting improved model performance on downstream tasks compared to training with purely synthetic or human-only data. **Token-level editing represents a significant advancement by offering a semi-supervised approach that leverages the strengths of both human-authored and model-generated data** without succumbing to the limitations of either approach.  The practical implications are significant as it presents a viable path towards harnessing synthetic data for enhancing large language models without incurring the risks of model collapse.

#### Model Collapse Proof
A rigorous 'Model Collapse Proof' within a research paper would involve a formal mathematical demonstration that iterative training on synthetic data inevitably leads to performance degradation.  This proof would likely leverage theoretical frameworks such as linear regression or information theory.  **Key elements** would include defining a precise metric for 'model collapse' (e.g., divergence between synthetic and real data distributions), establishing an upper bound on model performance as a function of iterations, and demonstrating that this bound is reached under specified conditions.  A robust proof might analyze distributional shifts within synthetic data, and show how these shifts systematically hinder the model's ability to generalize to unseen, real-world data.  **Crucially**, the proof should address the factors that lead to an accumulation of errors over iterations, such as the over-representation of certain features or the loss of long-tail phenomena. The demonstration should be supported by experiments showing that the proposed theoretical limits are indeed observed empirically.  The overall goal would be to formally prove, rather than merely observe, the existence and mechanisms of model collapse.

#### Pre-training Analysis
A pre-training analysis of large language models (LLMs) trained on synthetic data would involve a multifaceted investigation.  It would start by comparing the performance of models trained on varying ratios of synthetic and real data, **quantifying the impact of synthetic data on downstream tasks**. Key metrics like perplexity and accuracy on benchmark datasets would be crucial. The analysis would delve into the **underlying reasons for performance differences**, potentially exploring distributional shifts between real and synthetic data. **Feature-level analysis** comparing n-gram frequencies or embedding space similarity could reveal whether synthetic data lacks the diversity or nuances of real-world data, leading to overfitting or model collapse.  **Statistical measures** would help quantify these differences and confirm potential biases.  Furthermore, the study could investigate if the quality of synthetic data generation methods affects LLM performance, and whether techniques like token editing improve model outcomes. Finally, the analysis should propose ways to create more effective and less harmful synthetic data for LLM pre-training, possibly by incorporating techniques to mitigate the identified shortcomings.

#### Future Research
Future research should prioritize refining data synthesis methods to **mitigate coverage collapse and over-concentration of n-grams**.  This could involve exploring alternative generative models or incorporating techniques like data augmentation to enrich synthetic data distributions.  Investigating advanced data selection methods beyond importance sampling is crucial to effectively combine synthetic and human-produced data.  **Theoretical analyses should move beyond linear regression models** to encompass more complex models that better capture the nuances of language generation.  Furthermore, the impact of synthetic data quality on downstream tasks like continual pre-training and fine-tuning warrants extensive investigation.  Finally, the development of robust metrics to evaluate the quality and utility of synthetic data,  going beyond simple perplexity scores, is a critical area needing further exploration. This will allow for a more precise assessment of the success of various synthetic data generation techniques.

> üîº This figure demonstrates the negative impact of using synthetic data for training language models.  In the experiment, GPT-2 Small (124M) was pre-trained using varying proportions of human-generated text (Dolma dataset) and AI-synthesized text (Cosmopedia dataset). Part A shows that, counter-intuitively, the model's training loss decreases as the percentage of synthetic data increases. This is because the model is overfitting to the characteristics of the synthetic data. However, as shown in Part B, increased reliance on synthetic data results in significantly higher perplexity scores (PPL) across multiple validation sets, indicating a decline in the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. This demonstrates a negative correlation between the amount of synthetic data and overall model performance.

> üîº Figure 9 presents the probability distribution of perplexity (PPL) scores for both human-generated and synthetic text data.  The PPL, calculated using the StableLM-Zephyr-3B language model, measures how well a model predicts the next word in a sequence, with lower scores indicating better predictability. The distribution of PPL scores for human text shows a long tail, meaning the model sometimes struggles to predict words accurately, reflecting the diversity and complexity of human language. In contrast, the distribution for synthetic data is concentrated within a much narrower range and lacks a long tail. This indicates that the synthetic text is less diverse and more predictable than human text, thus highlighting a key characteristic of synthetic data: it often fails to capture the full complexity and nuances present in real-world human language.

> üîº Figure 12 presents a heatmap visualization of the distribution of locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) feature values obtained from density sampling of synthetic data.  The heatmap shows the frequency of different feature values across a range of hash functions. A significant observation is that the feature values are heavily concentrated within a narrow range, showing a lack of diversity. This concentration, visualized as a sharp peak in the distribution, indicates a phenomenon called 'feature collapse'. Feature collapse in synthetic data means that the generated data lacks the diversity and richness of features present in real, human-generated data. This limited feature coverage directly impacts the performance of language models trained on this type of data, limiting their ability to generalize well to unseen real-world examples.

> üîº Table 16 provides a detailed breakdown of the Dolma dataset (version 1.6), which is a large-scale dataset used for training language models. It lists the source of the data, the type of documents included (e.g., web pages, code, social media posts, scientific papers), and the size of the dataset in terms of UTF-8 bytes, the number of documents, and the number of Unicode words.  This information is valuable for understanding the composition and scale of the dataset used in training language models and helps to compare it to other datasets used in similar research.
