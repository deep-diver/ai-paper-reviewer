This makes it hard to align the visual information with the various levels of meaning needed to generate text. Standard **visual transformers (ViTs)** in MLLMs capture features at a single scale, inadequate for tasks requiring both fine-grained details and high-level semantics. Existing approaches to integrate multi-scale visual features, like feature pyramids, face challenges such as representation inheritance and compression effectiveness.\nThis paper introduces **LLaVA-UHD v2**, an improved MLLM that integrates a high-resolution feature pyramid using a **hierarchical window transformer (Hiwin)**. The Hiwin transformer uses two key modules: an **inverse feature pyramid** constructed by a ViT-derived feature up-sampling process, and **hierarchical window attention**, which compresses multi-level feature maps using a set of learnable queries attending to key features within hierarchical windows.  This architecture allows the model to capture both fine-grained details and high-level semantics, leading to better visual encoding for language generation.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.13871/podcast.wav"}
