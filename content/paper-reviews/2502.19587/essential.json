There's a growing need for updated encoders leveraging modern techniques. Existing solutions focus on fine-tuning but neglect inherent limitations of pre-trained backbones. The lack of standardized evaluation makes comparison between the pre-trained backbones difficult.\n\nTo tackle this, the study introduces **NeoBERT**, a next-generation encoder with state-of-the-art architecture, data, and training methods. It is a plug-and-play replacement with an optimal depth-to-width ratio and an extended context length. It uses a standardized fine-tuning to ensure fair evaluation and achieves state-of-the-art results on MTEB with only 250M parameters. The released code, data, and checkpoints promote research.", "affiliation": "Polytechnique Montr\u00e9al", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.19587/podcast.wav"}
