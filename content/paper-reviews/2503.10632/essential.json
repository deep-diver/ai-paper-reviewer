However, their use in vision tasks remains uncertain. Existing methods deploy KANs by substituting MLPs in vision Transformers (**ViTs**), prompting an investigation into their effectiveness. Initial results reveal KANs' struggles to surpass simpler MLPs in vision, yet properly designed KANs could improve performance. Current designs lack a learnable multihead attention module, vital for Transformers, prompting the question: Can learnable multi-head self-attention enhance (vision) Transformers? \n\nThis paper introduces a **general learnable Kolmogorov-Arnold Attention (KArAt)** for vanilla ViTs, operating on any basis. Addressing high computing and memory costs, a modular version, **Fourier-KArAt**, is proposed. Experiments show Fourier-KArAt either outperforms ViT counterparts or matches their performance on standard image datasets. Through loss landscape, weight distribution, attention visualization, and spectral behavior analyses, the architectures' performance and generalization are dissected, offering a benchmark and insights into KANs in advanced architectures.", "affiliation": "University of Central Florida", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10632/podcast.wav"}
