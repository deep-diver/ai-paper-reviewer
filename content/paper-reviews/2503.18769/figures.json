A black cube is to be placed on top of a green cube.  This illustrates the type of 3D spatial reasoning and manipulation tasks that the AlphaSpace methodology is designed to solve.  The figure serves as a visual representation of the core problem addressed in the paper.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
