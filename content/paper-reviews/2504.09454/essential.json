This approach ignores natural variations in information density, leading to trade-offs between local realism and global consistency. Large compression limits realism, while small compression increases computational demands. Current improvements to DiT focus on acceleration and applicability but leave the key compression principle untouched.\n\nD\u00b2iT addresses these limitations by dynamically compressing different image regions. It introduces a two-stage framework: Dynamic VAE (DVAE) encodes image regions at varying downsampling rates and Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D2iT) generates images by predicting multi-grained noise through a Dynamic Grain and Content Transformer. This achieves both global consistency and local realism.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.09454/podcast.wav"}
