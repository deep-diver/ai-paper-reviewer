[{"heading_title": "Modality Balance", "details": {"summary": "Modality balance in vision-language (VL) models is a critical aspect that determines the robustness and generalizability of these models. **Effective modality balance ensures that the model leverages both visual and textual information equally**, preventing reliance on a single modality, which leads to issues like dominant modality bias. This bias can severely degrade performance, especially when one modality is impaired or missing. Achieving modality balance requires careful consideration of gradient magnitudes and directions during training. **Techniques like gradient reweighting and projection are employed to ensure that both modalities contribute equally to the loss reduction**, preventing one modality from overshadowing the other. Furthermore, the architecture and training scheme, including the fusion mechanism, play crucial roles in maintaining this balance. By addressing these factors, VL models can achieve more stable and balanced learning, leading to improved performance and robustness across various vision-language tasks and datasets. **Focusing on this enables models to generalize better and avoid negative transfer**, which is vital for real-world applications."}}, {"heading_title": "Gradient Control", "details": {"summary": "**Gradient control** in multimodal learning is a critical area, aiming to mitigate biases and ensure balanced contributions from different modalities. Approaches often involve modulating gradients based on modality confidence or using modality-specific learning rates. The goal is to prevent dominant modalities from overshadowing weaker ones, which can lead to under-exploration and poor generalization. Techniques like gradient reweighting, projection, and surgery are used to align gradients and avoid conflicts. Effective gradient control enhances model robustness and enables synergistic integration of multimodal information, improving overall performance. The challenge lies in dynamically adjusting gradients to reflect the learning status of each modality while avoiding negative transfer and maintaining stability."}}, {"heading_title": "Avoiding Bias", "details": {"summary": "Addressing bias in vision-language models is crucial for fairness and reliability. **Dominant modality bias**, where models overly rely on one modality (text or image), can lead to poor performance, especially when that modality is impaired. **BALGRAD** framework addresses this by **reweighting gradients** to ensure balanced contributions from both modalities. By adjusting gradient magnitudes and aligning task directions, BALGRAD mitigates over-reliance on specific modalities and avoids negative transfer. This approach enhances robustness and promotes effective joint learning, leading to improved performance in various vision-language tasks. Addressing bias leads to **fair, generalizable and reliable models**, which is an essential step towards real-world deployment."}}, {"heading_title": "Experiments", "details": {"summary": "The experiments section is crucial for validating the proposed method, BALGRAD. The setup involves using standard datasets like UPMC Food-101, Hateful Memes, and MM-IMDb to benchmark performance under various conditions. A key aspect is the introduction of **controlled impairments** such as missing or noisy modalities (image or text) to simulate real-world scenarios where data quality varies. This allows for a rigorous assessment of BALGRAD's robustness to modality bias. Performance metrics like accuracy and F1-macro are used, along with a careful analysis of the **performance gap** (\u2206Gap) between image-impaired and text-impaired conditions, offering insights into modality balance. Furthermore, analyzing the training dynamics and gradient behavior contributes to understanding how BALGRAD achieves this balance. The experiments section also analyzes the individual contributions of gradient reweighting and projection towards overall improvements. The use of text decoder-based architecture is tested through BLIP and is experimented with various fusion mechanisms and backbone models, reinforcing the validity and wide applicability of the method. Datasets with additional modalities help test the generalizability of the model."}}, {"heading_title": "Limitations", "details": {"summary": "The paper acknowledges a limitation in extending its approach, BALGRAD, to multimodal models beyond two modalities, citing a **rapid increase in training costs** due to the need to consider relationships between gradients of each pair of modalities. The complexity in gradient management becomes computationally intensive and difficult to maintain effectively when dealing with three or more modalities. While BALGRAD is effective in bi-modal settings, its application in multimodal scenarios requires further refinement to manage the higher computational demands and ensure **balanced performance across all modalities**. The study is limited to two modalities, so future work must be done to extend BALGRAD to more modalities."}}]
