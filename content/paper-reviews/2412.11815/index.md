### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Automatic colorization of black-and-white image sequences, such as cartoons or comics, presents a challenge. While general image colorization using AI has seen progress, preserving the identity (e.g., consistent hair and clothing color) of characters across a sequence remains a hurdle. Current AI solutions aren't robust enough for industry use because they're hard to control and don't guarantee color consistency, making them unsuitable for professional animation or comic production.  This gap between current methods and industry requirements motivates the need for new, more controllable approaches.

This paper introduces ColorFlow, a new AI model specifically designed to colorize image sequences while maintaining character and object identity across frames.  It leverages a reference image pool to match colors, ensuring consistent hair color, clothing, and other attributes.  A key feature is a three-stage process: retrieving relevant color references, colorizing using context from references, and enhancing resolution. ColorFlow was tested on a new dataset, ColorFlow-Bench, comprising manga chapters with corresponding reference images, and demonstrated significant improvement over existing models in both visual quality and color consistency.

### In-depth insights


#### Contextual Colorflow
**Contextual ColorFlow** implies colorization guided by surrounding elements and broader image content.  This approach considers not only individual pixel colors but also relationships and **harmonies within the image**. Analyzing local features like textures and edges alongside global scene understanding would be crucial for such a system. It could improve coherence and realism in generated colors, especially in complex scenes with multiple objects and varying lighting.  Challenges lie in efficiently incorporating both local and global contexts.  **Attention mechanisms** and graph neural networks are promising directions for modeling these relationships and achieving **contextually aware colorization**.

#### Retrieval-Augmented
**Retrieval-augmented** generation combines the strengths of **retrieval systems and generative models**. Retrieval systems excel at identifying relevant information from vast data sources, while generative models can create novel content. This synergy allows for more **contextually rich and informative outputs**.  Retrieval augmentation can provide **relevant factual grounding**, helping prevent the generation of hallucinations or inaccurate statements. It can also assist in **overcoming biases** present in training data by introducing more diverse perspectives and information during generation. By retrieving relevant examples, retrieval augmentation can enhance the **controllability and personalization** of generated content.  However, it's important to ensure the retrieved information is **accurate and aligned with the desired context** to avoid introducing new biases or inaccuracies. The effectiveness relies on both the quality of retrieved data and the model's ability to integrate it seamlessly.

#### Benchmark Dataset
This paper introduces **ColorFlow-Bench**, a new benchmark for **reference-based image sequence colorization**.  Existing datasets lack sequential image coloring with ID consistency. ColorFlow-Bench contains 30 manga chapters, each with 50 black-and-white images and 40 color references. This dataset addresses the **lack of large-scale, sequential image data**  for this domain, facilitating the training and evaluation of models like ColorFlow, which specifically focuses on **preserving identity and color consistency across frames**. This benchmark enables **objective comparisons** and drives further research in sequential colorization.

#### Diffusion-Based Model
**Diffusion models** have revolutionized image generation, offering **unprecedented control and quality**. Their strength lies in the iterative denoising process, gradually refining a noisy image into a coherent output.  This process allows for the **seamless integration of guidance**, whether through text prompts, reference images, or other control mechanisms.  ColorFlow leverages this power for image colorization, using a **retrieval-augmented approach** to guide the diffusion process with relevant color information.  The iterative nature of diffusion models facilitates **fine-grained control** over colorization, enabling **accurate and consistent color mapping** across image sequences. This approach bypasses the limitations of traditional methods, offering a robust solution for applications like manga and animation colorization where preserving character identity is paramount.  Future research can explore enhanced control mechanisms and more sophisticated diffusion architectures to further refine colorization quality and expand applications.

#### Sequential ID in Manga
**Sequential ID in manga** emphasizes preserving character identity across frames during colorization.  This is **crucial for coherence** in storytelling.  Traditional methods struggle with **consistent colorization**, leading to jarring visual discrepancies.  ColorFlow addresses this by matching color identities from a reference pool using a retrieval-augmented pipeline. This ensures **consistent hairstyles and attire** throughout the sequence, improving visual storytelling. It represents a **significant advancement** in automated manga colorization.

> üîº ColorFlow, a three-stage framework designed for reference-based image sequence colorization, consists of Retrieval-Augmented Pipeline (RAP) extracting relevant color patches, In-context Colorization Pipeline (ICP) performing colorization using contextual information, and Guided Super-Resolution Pipeline (GSRP) upsampling for high-resolution outputs.  Each stage is crucial for maintaining color identity across frames and ensuring high-quality colorization.  RAP uses a retrieval mechanism to match ID-relevant image patches. ICP uses a two-branch design for accurate colorization with in-context learning.  GSRP refines and restores details during colorization. The input are the grayscale sequence, and the reference image pool.

It showcases how the augmentation pipeline takes a colored manga image and transforms it into grayscale. The process then involves linear interpolations between this grayscale image and the output from ScreenVAE [71] with varying proportions (0.66 and 0.33). This augmentation strategy allows the model to learn how to colorize by introducing variations in style and thereby enhances the overall colorization performance and generalization abilities of ColorFlow. The final image shows the corresponding ScreenVAE output.
