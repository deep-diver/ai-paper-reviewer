Faith., Comp., and Conc. denote faithfulness, completeness, and conciseness.", "description": "This figure illustrates the ReFeed framework, which refines summaries using multi-dimensional feedback.  The left side shows the ReFeed pipeline: it begins with an initial summary generated by an LLM, followed by multi-dimensional feedback (faithfulness, completeness, conciseness) obtained through an LLM evaluator. This feedback is then processed using reflective reasoning, resolving potential trade-offs between dimensions and handling noisy feedback. The refined summary is finally produced. The right side details the construction of the SumFeed-CoT dataset used to train ReFeed. This involves generating initial feedback, creating reasoning with guidelines (backtracking, simultaneous refinement, noise filtering), and employing quality control mechanisms. This dataset is specifically designed to facilitate complex reasoning, allowing ReFeed to handle multiple dimensions effectively.", "section": "4 ReFeed: Refinement with Reflective Reasoning on Feedback"}]
