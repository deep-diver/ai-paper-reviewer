This makes it difficult for users to realize their creative vision for video content.  Existing methods frequently rely on textual descriptions or cumbersome bounding box annotations, limiting expressiveness and precision.  Furthermore,  the intertwining nature of camera and object motion makes it hard for systems to correctly interpret user intent.\nMotionCanvas overcomes these limitations by introducing a user-friendly interface that allows for intuitive control of both camera and object motions in a scene-aware manner.  It achieves this by translating user-specified scene-space motion intents into spatiotemporal motion-conditioning signals for a video diffusion model.  **The key innovation is a Motion Signal Translation module that effectively bridges the gap between 3D scene-space understanding and 2D screen-space requirements of video generation models.**  The method is demonstrated to be effective in various scenarios, showcasing enhanced creative workflows for video editing and content creation.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.04299/podcast.wav"}
