This creates scalability issues and high annotation costs. The issue motivates the need to improve LLM reasoning without external supervision. Prior attempts focus on response level rewards, overlooking the benefits of stepwise supervision. They also lack global adherence to overarching goals, or are time-consuming. \n\nThe paper introduces **Genius, a generalizable unsupervised self-training framework**. Genius seeks the optimal response sequence stepwise and optimizes the LLM without external aids. It samples & estimates step value with stepwise foresight re-sampling. It also uses an advantage-calibrated optimization loss to mitigate inconsistencies. With 25K unsupervised queries, Genius boosts performance across reasoning benchmarks.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.08672/podcast.wav"}
