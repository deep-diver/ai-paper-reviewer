{"importance": "**Automating 2D animation colorization** is crucial for streamlining production. This work introduces a novel approach using **AI**, impacting researchers in computer graphics, animation, and AI by offering a more efficient and robust solution for **line art video colorization**. The ability to maintain **temporal coherence**, handle **sparse sketches**, and adapt to **varying character designs** opens new avenues for AI-assisted animation production research and development of advanced video generation models. ", "summary": "AniDoc automates cartoon animation line art video colorization, making animation creation easier!", "takeaways": ["AniDoc uses AI to automatically colorize line art animation, reducing manual effort.", "It handles variations in character design, sketches, and temporal coherence.", "It supports sparse sketch input, easing the creation of consistent animations. "], "tldr": "Creating 2D animation like anime involves coloring sketches, a tedious and labor-intensive process.  Current methods face challenges like mismatches between character designs and sketch poses, maintaining consistent coloring across frames, and dependence on densely drawn sketches. Automating colorization offers huge potential for streamlining animation workflows but is hindered by these issues. Existing tools require coloring keyframes or have limitations with real-world sketches. \nThis paper introduces AniDoc, an AI-powered tool that **automates the colorization of sketch animations**. It uses video diffusion models and correspondence matching to **ensure accurate coloring even when character designs and sketches differ**.  A two-stage training approach allows it to handle both dense and **sparse sketch input**, **reducing artist workload**.  It also addresses limitations of existing methods by processing **binarized sketches** and using **background augmentation**, resulting in more robust and realistic colorization, closer to real-world production pipelines.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.14173/podcast.wav"}
