This is a major bottleneck for high-resolution image processing, especially with large vision models and emerging multimodal large language models.  Existing methods like feature pyramids attempt to mitigate this, but top-performing models still rely on inefficient image pyramids due to their performance advantages.  The paper also explores the issue in multimodal understanding, as scaling up the resolution helps but incurs a high computational cost.\nThe paper proposes a novel architecture called Parameter-Inverted Image Pyramid Networks (PIIP) to address this issue. **PIIP employs pretrained models of varying sizes for different image resolutions, with smaller models processing higher-resolution images and larger models handling lower-resolution ones**. This parameter-inverted approach significantly reduces computation while maintaining accuracy.   The paper also introduces a novel cross-branch feature interaction mechanism to better integrate information from different scales. Experiments show PIIP outperforms existing methods on object detection, semantic segmentation, image classification, and multimodal understanding with significantly lower computation.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.07783/podcast.wav"}
