The study motivates new training paradigms that balance invariance with transformation awareness, pushing for deeper structural understanding in VLMs.", "summary": "VLMs struggle with basic image transforms! This paper reveals their limitations in understanding image-level changes, impacting downstream tasks.", "takeaways": ["VLMs show limitations in understanding multiple image-level augmentations.", "A new augmented Flickr8k dataset is created to facilitate the study of image transformations.", "State-of-the-art Image2Image models struggle with simple image transformations, revealing the impact of VLM limitations on downstream tasks."], "tldr": "**Vision Language Models (VLMs)** have shown promise in many tasks, but this paper highlights a key weakness: understanding basic image transformations. Despite their ability to handle complex tasks like image generation and VQA, VLMs often struggle with simple changes like rotations, brightness adjustments, and contrast alterations. This research investigates the image-level understanding of VLMs, specifically **CLIP and SigLIP**, revealing that these models lack comprehension of multiple image-level augmentations. The core question addressed is whether VLMs truly understand simple image transformations, a crucial aspect for image editing tasks.\n\nTo address this, the authors created an **augmented version of the Flickr8k dataset**, pairing each image with a detailed description of the applied transformation. This allows for a systematic evaluation of how well VLMs can associate textual descriptions of image augmentations with the modified images. The study evaluates the impact of these deficiencies on downstream tasks, particularly in image editing, by testing state-of-the-art Image2Image models on simple transformations. The findings reveal a significant gap between human and machine understanding of common image modifications.", "affiliation": "Cohere for AI Community", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.09837/podcast.wav"}
