Also machine learning assists tasks that cannot be solved by geometry alone, such as feature matching and monocular depth prediction. State-of-the-art SfM methods combine ML and visual geometry end-to-end. But visual geometry still plays a major role which increases computational cost.\n\nThis paper introduces **VGGT**, a feed-forward neural network for 3D reconstruction from multiple views. **VGGT** directly predicts 3D attributes like camera parameters, depth maps, and point tracks in a single pass, outperforming optimization-based alternatives. It is based on a standard transformer trained on 3D-annotated datasets. Furthermore, **VGGT** features enhance downstream tasks like point tracking and view synthesis.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.11651/podcast.wav"}
