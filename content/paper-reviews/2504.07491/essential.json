{"importance": "Kimi-VL offers a new efficient VLM that balances performance and efficiency, outperforming larger models in key areas and opening new avenues for low-resource multimodal reasoning and agent applications, especially for high-resolution and long-context tasks. **It also makes this research more accessible to researchers with fewer resources.**", "summary": "Kimi-VL: An efficient vision-language model achieving strong performance with only 2.8B active parameters by using MoE, long-context and high-resolution.", "takeaways": ["Kimi-VL achieves state-of-the-art performance on several multimodal benchmarks, outperforming larger models with significantly fewer activated parameters.", "Kimi-VL demonstrates strong capabilities in long-context understanding and high-resolution visual perception.", "The long-thinking variant, Kimi-VL-Thinking, further enhances reasoning abilities through long chain-of-thought and reinforcement learning."], "tldr": "Existing VLMs often face challenges such as limited scalability, high computational costs, and inadequate reasoning capabilities, especially in long contexts. To address these limitations, Kimi-VL is presented as an efficient open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) vision-language model that offers advanced multimodal reasoning, long-context understanding, and strong agent capabilities, all while activating only 2.8B parameters in its language decoder (Kimi-VL-A3B).\n\nThis paper introduces Kimi-VL, a vision-language model featuring a Moonlight MoE language model with only 2.8B activated parameters and a 400M native-resolution MoonViT vision encoder. By employing MoE and long-CoT techniques, it achieves impressive results across various challenging tasks and benchmarks, including general vision-language understanding, OCR, multi-image processing, and agent tasks. **Kimi-VL effectively competes with cutting-edge efficient VLMs while surpassing others in key domains, demonstrating strong multimodal reasoning with minimal activated parameters.**", "affiliation": "Moonshot.ai", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.07491/podcast.wav"}
