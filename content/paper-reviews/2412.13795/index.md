### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success, but recent research indicates their deep layers are often underutilized. **Pre-LN**, a common normalization technique in LLMs, leads to diminishing gradients in deeper layers, hindering their learning. This inefficiency wastes computational resources and limits potential model performance.  While **Post-LN** maintains strong deep layer gradients, it suffers from vanishing gradients in early layers. Existing research often frames this inefficiency as a compression opportunity, overlooking the potential of unlocking these layers' full capacity.

This paper introduces **Mix-LN**, a novel normalization technique that combines Pre-LN and Post-LN. Mix-LN applies Post-LN in initial layers and Pre-LN in later layers. This creates **more uniform gradient norms**, allowing both shallow and deep layers to contribute effectively. Experiments across various LLM sizes show that **Mix-LN consistently outperforms** Pre-LN and Post-LN. It achieves better pre-training results, more effective supervised fine-tuning, and enhanced reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The findings underscore the importance of high-quality deep layers for powerful LLMs, offering a promising way to improve performance without increasing model size.

> üîº This figure visually represents the architecture of three different layer normalization techniques within the context of transformer layers: Post-LN, Pre-LN and Mix-LN. Post-LN applies layer normalization after the residual connection adding the output of the attention or FFN block to the input of the block, Pre-LN applies it before the residual connection and Mix-LN combines Post-LN and Pre-LN within the same model. Mix-LN applies Post-LN to the earlier layers and Pre-LN to the deeper layers, in order to ensure more uniform gradients across layers. In the figure, 'x' represents the input to the layer, 'Layer Norm' is the layer normalization operation, and both 'Attention' and 'FFN' represent multi-head attention and feed-forward network blocks, respectively.

### In-depth insights


#### Pre-LN Inadequacy
**Pre-LN's limitations** stem from its impact on gradient flow in deep networks. While it mitigates **vanishing gradients** in initial layers, it inadvertently **reduces gradients** in deeper layers. This creates an imbalance, where earlier layers dominate learning while deeper layers contribute less. Consequently, the full potential of the network remains untapped, hindering performance.  This issue is not merely a compression opportunity, but a training deficiency that needs addressing.  The deeper layers' underutilization in Pre-LN models signifies a crucial area for improvement in training deep networks. **Mix-LN addresses** this by combining Pre-LN and Post-LN to improve gradient flow.

#### Mix-LN Synergy
**Mix-LN synergistically combines the strengths of Pre-LN and Post-LN**. Pre-LN's stable early-layer gradients and Post-LN's robust deep-layer gradients are leveraged for enhanced overall performance.  This synergy addresses the **ineffectiveness of deeper layers** in LLMs trained with Pre-LN by mitigating gradient degradation. The strategic application of Post-LN to initial layers and Pre-LN to deeper layers facilitates balanced gradient flow throughout the model. Mix-LN further stabilizes training dynamics associated with Post-LN, thus enabling efficient utilization of all model layers. Consequently, this method fosters improved feature diversity and richness across layers, leading to more robust and effective LLM training. This synergy contributes to more nuanced and generalized predictions, notably improving performance across various tasks and model sizes.

#### Gradient Balancing
**Gradient balancing** is crucial for effective deep learning model training.  It addresses issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, especially in deep networks. Techniques like **Mix-LN** combine the strengths of pre- and post-layer normalization to ensure more uniform gradient norms across layers.  This balances training across all layers, preventing underutilization of deeper layers and improving overall model capacity and performance.  It helps avoid training instabilities associated with some normalization methods.  Improved gradient flow allows all layers to contribute more effectively, especially during fine-tuning and reinforcement learning stages, impacting areas like natural language processing and computer vision.

#### LLM Enhancement
**Mix-LN** significantly enhances LLMs by optimizing deep layer training. Pre-LN's gradient limitations hinder deep layer effectiveness, while Post-LN causes gradient vanishing in early layers.  Mix-LN strategically combines both, applying Post-LN initially and Pre-LN later. This balances gradient flow, maximizing deep layer contribution and overall model capacity. Experimental results across various model sizes and tasks demonstrate consistent perplexity reduction and performance gains in fine-tuning and RLHF, confirming Mix-LN's effectiveness in unlocking LLM potential.

#### Normalization Limits
**Normalization**, while crucial in LLMs, faces **limitations** primarily due to gradient behavior. Pre-LN excels in early layers, mitigating vanishing gradients but hampering deeper layer effectiveness. Post-LN suffers from training instability, hindering convergence in larger models. These issues highlight a trade-off, where each technique's strength becomes its weakness. Mix-LN leverages this dynamic, using Post-LN for initial layers to address early vanishing gradients, and Pre-LN for deeper layers to optimize gradient flow, allowing each technique to supplement the other.

> üîº This figure presents an analysis of two large language models (LLMs), BERT-large and LLaMa2-7B, using two metrics: Angular Distance and Performance Drop.  Angular Distance measures the similarity between the activations of a layer and a subsequent layer.  A smaller distance (yellow) implies greater similarity and potentially redundancy. Performance drop measures the decrease in model performance when a specific layer is removed. A larger drop indicates the layer is more important. Subfigures (a) and (c) show these metrics for BERT-large (a Post-LN model), while (b) and (d) show the same for LLaMa2-7B (a Pre-LN model). The results demonstrate the differing behavior of layer effectiveness between these normalization methods.

A smaller distance (yellow) indicates higher similarity between layer representations, while a larger distance (purple) suggests greater dissimilarity.  Mix-LN tends to produce larger angular distances (more dissimilarity), particularly in the deeper layers, than the other methods, while Post-LN shows high similarity (smaller angular distances) mostly in the earlier layers. This observation illustrates how Mix-LN creates more diversity of learned representations across layers.

The Œ± parameter controls the proportion of layers in the model that utilize Post-Layer Normalization, while the remaining layers use Pre-Layer Normalization. A ratio of 0 corresponds to using Pre-LN for all layers, whereas a ratio of 1 represents using Post-LN for all layers. Intermediate values create a mix of Pre-LN and Post-LN within the model.  The table compares the performance of these mixed normalization strategies against the baseline performance of pure Pre-LN and Post-LN.  Lower perplexity scores indicate better performance.
