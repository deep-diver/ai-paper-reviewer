Each iteration begins by selecting a subset of training queries. For this subset, the algorithm searches for the optimal temperature and reward threshold that maximize the average balance score, a metric balancing exploration and exploitation.  These optimal parameters are then used to generate and evaluate responses for the complete training set, selecting high-quality responses for model updates.  This process iteratively refines the model's performance by dynamically adjusting parameters to balance the model's ability to explore diverse solutions with its ability to leverage the reward system to select high-quality ones.", "section": "2 Monitoring Exploration and Exploitation in Self-Improvement"}]
