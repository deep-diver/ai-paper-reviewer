### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Multimodal mathematical reasoning by large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training data.  Existing models struggle with high-precision CoT reasoning and limited potential during test time.  This hinders real-world applications.

This paper introduces URSA, a three-module framework integrating CoT distillation, trajectory rewriting, and format unification. URSA generates a new dataset, MMathCoT-1M, and trains a robust model, URSA-7B, achieving state-of-the-art results. A data synthesis strategy, DualMath-1.1M, and a verifier model, URSA-RM-7B, further boost test-time scaling and out-of-distribution generalization capabilities. **The open-sourced model and data are valuable resources for future research.**

### In-depth insights


#### Multimodal CoT
Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning extends the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by integrating visual information with textual reasoning.  **This multimodal approach presents unique challenges**, such as handling modality-specific mismatches (e.g., discrepancies between visual and textual data) and generating high-quality training data.  **A key benefit of multimodal CoT** is the ability to tackle complex problems requiring both visual interpretation and logical deduction, which are beyond the scope of unimodal LLMs.  However, **effective multimodal CoT relies on robust data synthesis strategies** for both training and testing, due to the scarcity of real-world multimodal CoT data.  Furthermore, **robust evaluation metrics are needed** to assess the true capabilities of multimodal CoT systems, as traditional metrics may not capture the nuances of this approach.  Future research in this area should focus on developing innovative data synthesis techniques and refined evaluation methods to fully realize the potential of multimodal CoT in various fields.

#### URSA-7B Model
The URSA-7B model, as described in the research paper, represents a significant advancement in multimodal mathematical reasoning.  **Its core strength lies in its ability to perform chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning**, a crucial step toward solving complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps.  The model's effectiveness is significantly boosted by the **MMathCoT-1M dataset**, a meticulously curated instruction fine-tuning dataset specifically designed for multimodal mathematics. This dataset plays a vital role in enabling URSA-7B to achieve state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks.  Furthermore, **the innovative dual-view process supervision**, using DualMath-1.1M, elevates URSA-7B's reasoning capabilities by addressing both logical and visual accuracy, leading to superior performance and robustness, particularly in scenarios with complex visual inputs.  The integration of URSA-RM-7B as a verifier further enhances the model's capabilities for test-time scaling, showcasing a comprehensive approach to addressing challenges within multimodal mathematical reasoning.

#### DualMath-1.1M
The proposed DualMath-1.1M dataset is a crucial contribution to advancing multimodal mathematical reasoning.  **Its focus on dual-view process supervision**‚Äîincorporating both logical correctness and visual accuracy‚Äîaddresses limitations in existing datasets which primarily focus on logical accuracy alone. By synthesizing data with targeted hallucination injection and binary error localization, DualMath-1.1M offers a sophisticated training resource that enables models to not only produce correct answers, but also robust and reliable reasoning steps.  This dual-view approach directly addresses the complexity introduced by multimodal data, which may contain inconsistencies between textual and visual information. The dataset's impact extends beyond immediate performance gains; it pushes the boundary of test-time scaling methods by offering a rigorous means to evaluate and enhance reasoning processes. The success of DualMath-1.1M in training a verifier model (URSA-RM-7B) showcases its potential in improving the efficiency and reliability of future multimodal mathematical reasoning systems.

#### Test-Time Scaling
Test-time scaling in large language models (LLMs) focuses on improving reasoning performance **without retraining** the model.  This is crucial for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained settings or when rapid adaptation is needed.  The paper explores this by introducing a data synthesis strategy that generates process annotation datasets. This approach moves beyond simply producing correct answers, **emphasizing the generation of high-quality reasoning trajectories**.  By training a separate verifier model, the system enhances the selection of correct reasoning paths at inference time, leading to improved accuracy and robustness.  This dual-pronged approach, combining data augmentation and model verification, represents a **significant step forward** in efficient LLM deployment and demonstrates the potential for achieving substantial performance gains without the need for additional training data or increased model size.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on multimodal mathematical reasoning could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the model's capabilities to handle even more complex mathematical problems and diverse problem types** is crucial.  Investigating **improved data synthesis techniques** that generate more sophisticated and nuanced reasoning trajectories is key for improving model accuracy. This includes exploring methods to better capture the subtleties of visual information within the context of mathematical problems.  Additionally, **developing more robust and effective verification methods** is essential to ensure accuracy and enhance test-time scaling.  The current verification model could be enhanced by incorporating more sophisticated evaluation metrics and potentially incorporating external knowledge bases. Finally, **exploring alternative architectures and training methodologies** may reveal further performance improvements. This could include exploring the integration of other advanced techniques like reinforcement learning and self-supervised learning to further enhance the model's capabilities.

> üîº Table 8 presents a detailed comparison of the performance of various Large Language Models (LLMs) on the WE-MATH testmini subset.  The table is organized to show the overall accuracy of each model across different problem complexities (one-step, two-step, and three-step problems). Additionally, it provides a more granular breakdown of performance based on different problem-solving strategies, offering insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model in various mathematical reasoning approaches.

> üîº Table 10 presents a performance comparison of various Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on the GeoQA benchmark.  GeoQA specifically tests the ability of MLLMs to solve geometric reasoning problems. The table compares the accuracy of different models, including both closed-source and open-source models, across varying model sizes (parameters). This allows for an assessment of the impact of model size on geometric reasoning capabilities.
