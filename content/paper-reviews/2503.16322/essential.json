It's especially hard when training data & computing power are limited. Current methods need large datasets & lots of GPU memory to fine-tune models or struggle to produce high-quality synthetic data. This paper asks if the ultra-resolution adaptation process can be simplified. \n\nThis paper answers the question positively by proposing **URAE, a set of guidelines** focusing on data & parameter efficiency. It shows that using synthetic data created by some teacher models can greatly help training convergence. When synthetic data isn't available, tuning minor components of weight matrices is better than low-rank adapters. Lastly, it is found disabling classifier-free guidance is essential for guidance-distilled models like FLUX.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16322/podcast.wav"}
