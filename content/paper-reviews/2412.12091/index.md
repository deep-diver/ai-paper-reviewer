### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Creating realistic 3D scenes from single images is tough due to limited info & massive compute. Existing methods either need multiple views, have lengthy optimization, or struggle with detail & consistency. This limits broader use in AR/VR or gaming. 

This paper proposes Wonderland, a system that generates detailed 3D scenes from single images efficiently. **It leverages the power of video diffusion models** to learn 3D relationships from videos, and uses their compressed video latents. **A new dual-branch conditioning mechanism controls camera paths**, and **a large reconstruction model directly builds 3D** from these latents. It yields high-quality, consistent 3D scenes faster than prior art.

> üîº Figure 1 presents a set of visual outputs produced by the Wonderland model. Using just a single input image, Wonderland is able to generate novel views of a 3D scene. The 3D reconstruction process is feed-forward, leveraging the latent space of a video diffusion model to efficiently create 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations. This figure demonstrates the model's capacity to generate diverse and detailed 3D scenes from a single image.

### In-depth insights


#### 3D from Video
**Wonderland** leverages video diffusion models to generate 3D scenes from single images.  It bypasses the limitations of image-based methods by operating in a compressed, **3D-aware latent space**, achieving higher efficiency and broader scene coverage.  The novel **dual-branch conditioning** mechanism ensures precise camera control, vital for novel view synthesis. The **latent-based 3D reconstruction model (LaLRM)** directly generates 3D Gaussian Splats from these latents, sidestepping costly per-scene optimization and enabling fast, high-fidelity 3D generation. Though current work focuses on static scenes, future development could incorporate temporal dynamics for **4D content creation**.

#### Latent 3D
**Latent 3D** representations offer a **powerful** approach to 3D scene understanding and generation. By operating in a **compressed latent space**, rather than directly on pixels or point clouds, models can achieve **greater efficiency** and **scalability**.  This is particularly crucial for handling complex scenes and facilitating feed-forward inference. Moreover, learning in latent space allows models to capture **higher-level semantic information**, leading to improved **generalization** and **robustness**, especially for out-of-domain data. Latent 3D also opens up exciting possibilities for controllable generation, allowing manipulation of scene attributes within the latent space.  Despite these advantages, challenges remain in bridging the gap between latent representations and explicit 3D geometry, as well as ensuring consistency between latent manipulations and the rendered output. Continued research in this area promises further advancements in 3D vision tasks.

#### Dual-Branch Control
**Dual-branch control** enhances camera guidance in video diffusion models. One branch uses **ControlNet** for precise pose control by directly influencing feature maps with camera data.  The other branch employs **LoRA** for efficient fine-tuning, enhancing the model's adaptation to static scenes and camera motions without altering base weights. This combined approach balances fine-grained control and computational efficiency, enabling high-quality video generation with **accurate camera trajectories**.

#### Progressive Training
**Progressive training** tackles the **domain gap** between video latents and 3D Gaussian Splats.  Initial training uses **lower resolution** videos with known camera poses from benchmarks.  This establishes a foundation for 3D consistency.  Subsequently, training scales to **higher resolutions**, incorporating **synthetic data** and out-of-domain videos.  This enhances **generalization** and robustness to unseen scenarios, critical for high-fidelity, wide-scope 3D scene reconstruction.

#### Zero-Shot Synthesis
**Zero-shot synthesis** signifies generating novel content without prior training on specific examples. This capability is crucial in 3D scene generation, allowing creation from single images or sparse data. Wonderland leverages this power by utilizing camera-guided video diffusion models. These models, trained on extensive video data, implicitly encode 3D scene understanding, enabling novel view synthesis and unseen region reconstruction. **Key aspects of zero-shot synthesis in Wonderland** include: 1) **Leveraging video diffusion models**: Camera trajectories embedded in video data instill 3D awareness. 2) **Dual-branch camera guidance**: Ensures precise control over camera poses for multi-view consistency. 3) **Latent Large Reconstruction Model (LaLRM)**: Efficiently reconstructs 3D scenes from compressed video latents. These components allow Wonderland to generate high-quality, wide-scope 3D scenes directly from single images.

> üîº Given a single image, Wonderland reconstructs 3D scenes using a camera-guided video diffusion model and a latent-based large reconstruction model (LaLRM). The video diffusion model, conditioned on the input image and camera trajectory, generates a 3D-aware video latent. This latent is then used by the LaLRM to construct the 3D scene in a feed-forward manner.  The dual-branch camera conditioning in the video diffusion model ensures precise pose control, while the LaLRM's operation in latent space allows for efficient reconstruction of wide-scope, high-fidelity 3D scenes.

> üîº This figure provides a qualitative comparison of several camera-guided video generation models, including MotionCtrl, VD3D, ViewCrafter, and the proposed method, Wonderland. Each model is tasked with generating a video sequence conditioned on a single input image and a specified camera trajectory. The 14th frame of each generated sequence is displayed for comparison, along with the ground truth frame and the conditional input image. The comparison highlights Wonderland's superior performance in terms of precise camera control, high visual quality, and wide-scope scene generation, particularly when compared to other methods that might exhibit misalignment with the specified camera trajectory, limited visual quality, or a narrow scope of generation.

It illustrates the integration of camera guidance using both a LoRA-branch and a ControlNet-branch during the training process. Random noise is introduced to video latents, while the conditional image is incorporated through feature concatenation. For clarity, text tokens, diffusion time embeddings, positional embeddings, and some reshaping operations are omitted.  In the underlying diffusion transformer, text tokens are concatenated with visual tokens along the number-of-token dimension. To maintain consistent length, zero-padding is applied to the camera tokens before concatenation or element-wise summation. The SiLU activation function is used by default.

We ignore the text tokens, the diffusion time embeddings, the positional embeddings, and some reshaping operations for simplicity in the figure. In the foundation diffusion transformer, the text tokens are concatenated along number-of-token dimension with visual tokens.
