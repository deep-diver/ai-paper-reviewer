Reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise but faces challenges: unexplored multimodal tasks and training constraints like constant Kullback-Leibler divergence. These issues can lead to suboptimal solutions. The ability to handle different tasks across varied data distributions is critical for real-world deployment. \n\nThe study proposes an advanced MLLM equipped with understanding and reasoning abilities across multimodal tasks. The model uses Group Relative Policy Optimization with a dynamic Kullback-Leibler strategy (GRPO-D) to enhance RL performance. GRPO-D improves performance and cross-task generalization. Results show that models trained with GRPO-D can transfer to other tasks, reducing task-specific data needs.
