The caster wheel is made up of rollers, which are small wheels attached around the periphery of the main wheel. These rollers are able to rotate freely, allowing the caster wheel to move in any direction without needing to reorient itself.  A simplified diagram to the right further illustrates the mechanism, showing the offsets and axes of rotation. The offset between the vertical axis of the swivel mechanism and the roll axis of the wheel is what makes the robot holonomic. This offset creates a lever arm, causing the wheel to trail behind the swivel axis as the robot moves, allowing the wheels to naturally align with the direction of motion.", "section": "Hardware Design"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2412.10447/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Our mobile base is designed to be modular and easily reconfigurable.

The holonomic base, free from nonholonomic motion constraints, takes a shorter, more direct path (orange).  In contrast, the differential drive base (blue) is forced to follow a longer, less efficient path due to its inability to move directly sideways. This demonstrates the advantage of holonomic drive for maneuverability and efficiency in mobile manipulation tasks.", "section": "4.2 Differential drive comparison"}]
