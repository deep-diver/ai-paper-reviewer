Current mobile bases are costly, specialized for industrial use, and kinematically constrained. This makes them unsuitable and inaccessible for many researchers focusing on household environments.  A lack of affordable research hardware hinders the progress of real-world mobile manipulation research.  Easier data collection is critical to unlocking the potential of mobile manipulation for household robotics. \nThis paper introduces **TidyBot++, an open-source, low-cost, and holonomic mobile manipulator designed for household tasks.**  It uses **powered casters**, enabling **unconstrained sideways movement**, unlike typical wheeled robots. This simplifies data collection and policy learning.  An intuitive **mobile phone teleoperation interface** facilitates easy data acquisition for imitation learning. The researchers show that **learned policies from this system successfully perform various common household tasks**, demonstrating the effectiveness of their design and its potential to accelerate mobile manipulation research.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2412.10447/podcast.wav"}
