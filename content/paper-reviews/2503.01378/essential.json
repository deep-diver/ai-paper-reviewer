This limitation hinders fair comparisons and exploration of higher-level cognitive abilities like reasoning, human recognition, and symbol understanding.\n\nThis paper introduces **CognitiveDrone**, a VLA model designed for real-time cognitive task solving and reasoning in UAVs. Paired with CognitiveDroneBench, an open-source benchmark built on Gazebo, that integrates a drone racing track with cognitive checkpoints. The system includes an auxiliary reasoning module based on the VLM model Qwen2.5-VL, creating the CognitiveDrone-R1 variant. CognitiveDrone significantly outperforms existing models in complex tasks.", "affiliation": "Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2503.01378/podcast.wav"}
