### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Machine translation often struggles with figurative language, producing inaccurate or unnatural translations.  This paper tackles this problem by introducing DRT-01, a new approach that uses a multi-agent system to train a model that mimics human-like reasoning during translation.  This process, known as ‚Äòlong chain-of-thought‚Äô, helps the model understand and translate complex sentences more accurately.

The researchers used a novel data generation technique involving three agents (translator, advisor, evaluator) that iteratively refine translations, followed by GPT-40 improvements.  The resulting DRT-01 model was evaluated on literature translation, showcasing **significantly improved performance** compared to state-of-the-art models. This suggests **long chain-of-thought is a promising direction** for advancing machine translation technology, particularly in handling complex or nuanced language.

> üîº Table 1 presents a statistical overview of the datasets used in the study, including the DRT-01 dataset and the Marco-01 CoT dataset.  It details the number of samples and the average token length for the query (source sentence), the thought process (chain-of-thought), and the output (translated sentence) in each dataset.  This allows for a comparison of data characteristics across different datasets, notably highlighting the length of the chain-of-thought in the DRT-01 dataset.
