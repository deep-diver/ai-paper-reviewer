### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with detailed visual understanding, often compromising overall performance when focusing on specific tasks. Existing methods either develop tool-using approaches or unify visual tasks, but these often negatively impact the model's broader capabilities. 

To overcome this, the paper introduces Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that leverages differentiable task preferences from fine-grained visual tasks.  **TPO uses learnable task tokens to connect multiple task-specific heads to the MLLM, significantly improving performance on various visual tasks through multi-task co-training.** The experimental results show that TPO achieves a substantial performance boost in MLLMs. This demonstrates TPO's ability to enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models.

> üîº The figure illustrates the Task Preference Optimization (TPO) method.  TPO enhances the fine-grained visual understanding capabilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating differentiable task preferences. These preferences are derived from dense visual supervision via task-specific heads, which establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM.  The visual example shows how the model tracks the movement of a cup with a candy underneath, demonstrating the ability to handle fine-grained visual details.

### In-depth insights


#### Visual Task Alignment
Visual task alignment in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) is crucial for bridging the gap between general visual understanding and precise, fine-grained perception.  **Current MLLMs often struggle with tasks requiring detailed visual analysis**, such as object tracking, temporal grounding, or referring expression segmentation.  **The core idea behind visual task alignment is to explicitly incorporate these specific visual tasks into the MLLM's architecture and training process.**  This might involve designing specialized task heads or modules that process visual inputs in a task-specific manner.  **Effective alignment ensures that the MLLM can leverage rich visual cues to generate more accurate and informative responses.**  The challenge lies in balancing task-specific performance with overall multimodal capabilities.  Overly focusing on individual tasks may detrimentally affect the MLLM's performance on other tasks, necessitating careful optimization strategies.  Furthermore, achieving effective alignment requires high-quality, task-specific training data, and may demand innovative training methodologies that can balance both task-specific and general multimodal training.

#### TPO Optimization
Task Preference Optimization (TPO) is a novel method designed to enhance multimodal large language models (MLLMs) by aligning them with the nuances of fine-grained visual tasks.  **TPO leverages differentiable task preferences derived from dense visual supervision via task-specific heads**, effectively bridging the gap between MLLM's general understanding and the precise requirements of specific visual tasks.  The method introduces **learnable task tokens** that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM, enabling the model to dynamically activate appropriate heads based on user instructions. **The co-training strategy employed within TPO leads to synergistic gains**, surpassing single-task training approaches and achieving overall robust performance.  This demonstrates TPO's potential for improving MLLM capabilities in various visual tasks and underscores its scalability across different MLLM architectures and datasets.

#### Multimodal Gains
The concept of "Multimodal Gains" in a research paper would explore the synergistic improvements achieved when combining multiple modalities (like text and images) in a model.  **Significant gains are expected beyond the simple sum of individual modality performances.** This section would likely present empirical evidence demonstrating that a multimodal model outperforms unimodal counterparts on various tasks.  The analysis might delve into the **types of tasks where multimodal learning excels**, such as those requiring complex reasoning or contextual understanding.  It could also investigate the **factors influencing these gains**, including the quality of multimodal data, model architecture, and training strategies.  A key aspect might be the exploration of **how different modalities interact and complement each other**, offering unique insights not achievable through individual modalities alone.  Finally, this section would probably discuss limitations and suggest avenues for future research focusing on further enhancing multimodal capabilities and addressing any identified shortcomings.

#### Scalability of TPO
The scalability of Task Preference Optimization (TPO) is a crucial aspect determining its practical applicability.  **TPO's modular design**, incorporating task-specific heads and tokens, inherently promotes scalability.  Adding new tasks simply involves integrating additional heads and tokens, trained jointly with the existing components, without requiring retraining the entire model. This **incremental training approach** significantly reduces computational cost compared to retraining from scratch. The method shows evidence of scaling across different MLLMs, implying that the core TPO principles are transferable and adaptable to various architectural designs.  **Data scalability** is another key factor, demonstrated by the improvements observed when increasing the quantity of visual task data.  **The more task-specific data available**, the more effectively the task heads can learn, leading to improved performance. However,  **future research** should focus on evaluating the potential limitations to scalability at extremely large scales and with a vast number of tasks, exploring methods to manage potential computational and memory demands.

#### Future Directions
Future research should explore **improving the scalability of TPO** by addressing limitations in task diversity and data requirements.  Investigating the use of **unsupervised or self-supervised learning methods** alongside human annotations could significantly broaden the applicability and efficiency of TPO. Another crucial area is exploring **how TPO interacts with different MLLM architectures and scales**.  The effects of various LLMs and their sizes on TPO's performance should be thoroughly analyzed.  Finally, examining **TPO's generalization capabilities across diverse unseen tasks** and datasets is vital to establish its robustness and adaptability.  This could involve testing TPO on a wider range of visual tasks and evaluating its effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

> üîº This figure compares three different learning methods: Preference Optimization (PO), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Task Preference Optimization (TPO).  PO uses a reward model to maximize the likelihood of the model's output given the reward. DPO uses a reference model's output as a preference signal to guide the main model's training. TPO uses visual task annotations as preferences, enabling it to incorporate this information through task-specific heads and tokens.  The diagram illustrates the data flow in each method, indicating which components are frozen or unfrozen during training.  The use of solid and dotted lines visualizes data flow and feedback, respectively. This highlights how TPO incorporates visual task knowledge into the MLLM through jointly maximizing the likelihood of visual task estimations and multimodal dialogue.  In essence, the figure shows the evolution of model training techniques from purely likelihood-based methods to methods incorporating user preferences or visual task-specific information, culminating in TPO.

> üîº This table details the hyperparameters and training settings used in the Task Preference Optimization (TPO) method, specifically for the VideoChat2 model.  It breaks down the configuration across different stages of the training process, outlining learning rates (LR) for various components like the vision encoder, connector, task heads (temporal, region, mask), task tokens, and the Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned with LoRA.  The table also shows the optimizers used (AdamW), weight decay, input resolution, frame count, LoRA rank and alpha for the LLM, warmup ratio, batch size, epochs, and the numerical precision (DeepSpeed bf16). The different stages reflect the incremental introduction and training of these elements: Stage 1 focuses on task assignment and LoRA training of the LLM; Stage 2 fine-tunes task heads and tokens; and Stage 3 jointly trains all components, including multimodal conversation data.

> üîº This table details the datasets used for training the Task Preference Optimization (TPO) model.  It's broken down by training stage (1, 2, and 3), with each stage focusing on different aspects of model training.  Stage 1 focuses on task assignment, using smaller datasets to teach the model to identify the task type. Stage 2 concentrates on training the visual task heads, utilizing significantly larger datasets for each task. Stage 3 involves multi-task training, combining large datasets for all tasks and incorporating a large multimodal conversation dataset to optimize overall performance and alignment between tasks. Note that temporal grounding is composed of moment retrieval and highlight detection subtasks.
