### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

**Recovering intrinsic properties of objects from images** is vital but challenging due to ambiguities between lighting and material. Traditional methods are computationally expensive and struggle with these ambiguities, while learning-based methods suffer from **multi-view inconsistency**.  Existing datasets are limited in scale and lighting diversity, hindering effective training. **Accurate intrinsic image decomposition** enables applications such as realistic image editing, relighting, and 3D content creation.

This work introduces IDArb, a diffusion-based model that tackles **intrinsic decomposition** from an **arbitrary number of views** under **unconstrained lighting**. IDArb leverages a **cross-view, cross-domain attention** module for **multi-view consistent decomposition**. To enable robust training, the researchers introduce **ARB-Objaverse**, a novel dataset containing a **diverse collection of objects** rendered under **various lighting**.  This combined approach achieves **state-of-the-art results** in intrinsic decomposition on both synthetic and real-world images and could serve as **strong priors** for downstream applications like **relighting**, **photometric stereo**, and **3D reconstruction**.

### In-depth insights


#### Intrinsic Decomp
**Intrinsic decomposition** separates an image into its underlying components: **albedo, normal, metallic, and roughness**.  This disentanglement is crucial for various computer vision tasks, such as **relighting, material editing, and 3D reconstruction**. Traditional methods face challenges with computational cost and ambiguities between lighting and material properties.  Learning-based approaches, while faster, struggle with multi-view consistency.  **Novel approaches** leverage diffusion models and cross-domain attention mechanisms to fuse information from multiple views, enabling **robust** decomposition under diverse lighting.  These advancements enhance the **realism and editability of 3D content creation**.

#### Diffusion Model
**Diffusion models** offer a powerful approach to intrinsic image decomposition, tackling the challenge of separating an image into its underlying components like albedo, normals, and material properties.  These models excel at capturing high-frequency details and complex relationships between intrinsic components, leading to more realistic and nuanced estimations. By iteratively denoising input images, diffusion models effectively learn the underlying distribution of intrinsic properties, enabling the generation of high-quality, consistent outputs.  However, applying diffusion models to intrinsic decomposition presents unique challenges. The high dimensionality of intrinsic data, coupled with ambiguities in separating lighting effects from material properties, requires careful model design and training strategies.  The use of cross-view and cross-component attention mechanisms, along with specialized training datasets, significantly enhances the model's ability to resolve these ambiguities and generate consistent multi-view decompositions.

#### Multi-view Decomp
**Multi-view decomposition** methods extract intrinsic object properties (albedo, normals, material) from multiple images.  These methods address the inherent ambiguity of inverse rendering by leveraging complementary information across views, promoting consistency.  However, **computational cost** can be a significant challenge, especially with dense multi-view inputs and complex lighting.  Furthermore, the arbitrary number of input views and diverse lighting introduce difficulties.  **Deep learning-based methods** can mitigate the computational burden by leveraging learned priors and enabling efficient inference.  Addressing challenges like **view consistency** and **robustness** under varying illuminations often involves novel attention mechanisms and training strategies.  **Multi-view decomposition** offers valuable input for applications like relighting, material editing, and 3D reconstruction, advancing realistic content creation.

#### Dataset Creation
**Dataset creation** is crucial for training robust machine learning models.  A **high-quality dataset** should be **diverse, representative**, and accurately **labeled**.  Key considerations include data **sourcing, preprocessing, augmentation**, and **validation**.  Careful design choices in these stages significantly impact model performance.  **Data augmentation** techniques, such as **random cropping, rotations, and color jittering**, can increase the dataset's size and variability, improving the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.  Furthermore, using appropriate **validation techniques**, like **k-fold cross-validation**, can help prevent **overfitting** and ensure that the model can perform well on new, unseen data.  Finally, open-sourcing the dataset promotes reproducibility and allows for community-driven improvements and broader research applications.

#### Real-World Limits
**Real-world limitations** significantly hinder the practicality of purely synthetic training. While pre-trained models offer advantages, **domain gaps** between synthetic and real-world data necessitate further refinement. In real-world scenarios, **material complexity** surpasses the often-simplified representations in training datasets. Phenomena like spatially varying metallic properties due to corrosion or intricate text patterns challenge the model's ability to capture fine-grained material variations. Additionally, outdoor scenes and complex lighting conditions pose further difficulties. Current models, predominantly trained on object-centric synthetic data, **lack the robustness** required for accurate decomposition in these complex real-world environments. This limitation underscores the importance of unsupervised techniques or other methods of incorporating real-world data to bridge the gap between synthetic training and real-world performance.

> üîº This table presents a quantitative comparison of different intrinsic decomposition methods' performance on the NeRFactor dataset for photometric stereo under the challenging One-Light-At-a-Time (OLAT) condition, using varying numbers of input images (2, 4, and 8). Performance metrics such as albedo (SSIM, PSNR) and normal (cosine similarity) are compared across methods like IID, RGB‚ÜîX, SDM-UniPS, and the proposed IDArb. The results demonstrate IDArb achieves the best performance across all metrics and input image counts.

> üîº This table presents an ablation study on using IDArb's intrinsic component predictions as pseudo-labels to guide optimization-based inverse rendering methods, specifically NVDiffRecMC.  The experiments are conducted on NeRFactor and Synthetic4Relight datasets.  It compares NVDiffRecMC's raw and scaled albedo predictions, relighting quality, and estimated roughness, both with and without the IDArb-derived pseudo-labels.  The table demonstrates that using IDArb's predictions as a prior improves the optimization process in NVDiffRecMC, leading to enhanced relighting results and more physically plausible material estimation, particularly in mitigating color shifts in the reconstructed albedo.
