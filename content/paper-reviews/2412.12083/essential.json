Traditional methods are computationally expensive and struggle with these ambiguities, while learning-based methods suffer from **multi-view inconsistency**.  Existing datasets are limited in scale and lighting diversity, hindering effective training. **Accurate intrinsic image decomposition** enables applications such as realistic image editing, relighting, and 3D content creation.\nThis work introduces IDArb, a diffusion-based model that tackles **intrinsic decomposition** from an **arbitrary number of views** under **unconstrained lighting**. IDArb leverages a **cross-view, cross-domain attention** module for **multi-view consistent decomposition**. To enable robust training, the researchers introduce **ARB-Objaverse**, a novel dataset containing a **diverse collection of objects** rendered under **various lighting**.  This combined approach achieves **state-of-the-art results** in intrinsic decomposition on both synthetic and real-world images and could serve as **strong priors** for downstream applications like **relighting**, **photometric stereo**, and **3D reconstruction**.", "affiliation": "Chinese University Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2412.12083/podcast.wav"}
