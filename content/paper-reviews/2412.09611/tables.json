We quantitatively measure the editing performance of our method over competing approaches both in terms of text alignment using CLIP-T [34], and content preservation using CLIP-I [34] and DINO [7] metrics where higher is better for all metrics. We compare our method with both latent diffusion [6, 11], and flow-matching-based approaches [16, 37]. Overall, our method strikes a good balance in terms of alignment with the editing prompt and content preservation. Supplementary to these metrics, we also present a user study as a perceptual evaluation that aligns with our claims regarding edit performance, where our method outperforms the competing approaches.", "description": "This table presents a quantitative comparison of FluxSpace with other state-of-the-art image editing methods, using CLIP-T, CLIP-I, and DINO metrics, and a user study to evaluate performance on tasks such as adding eyeglasses and smiles.  It demonstrates FluxSpace's superior ability to balance textual alignment with content preservation and maintain subject identity, compared to both latent diffusion and flow-matching based approaches.", "section": "5.
