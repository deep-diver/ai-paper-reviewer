This is particularly problematic for real-time applications and low-resource settings. \nThe paper introduces Samba-ASR, a novel ASR model that uses the Mamba architecture, which is based on structured state-space models (SSMs).  Unlike transformers, Mamba-based systems exhibit linear complexity, leading to significant improvements in computational efficiency and scalability.  The authors demonstrate that Samba-ASR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing transformer-based models, setting a new benchmark for the field and providing a more robust solution for diverse ASR tasks.
