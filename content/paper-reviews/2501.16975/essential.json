However, **tokenization**, the process of converting text into tokens for model processing, remains less explored in the context of scaling laws.  This paper investigates the impact of **vocabulary size** on LLM performance.  Existing research suggests that increasing the vocabulary size can improve performance but also significantly increases the training cost. This paper aims to improve this area by focusing on efficient model scaling while considering vocabulary size as a critical factor. \nThis research introduces **Over-Tokenized Transformers**, a novel framework that decouples input and output vocabularies to improve model scalability.  The researchers discover that scaling up the input vocabulary size leads to a **log-linear relationship** between input vocabulary size and training loss.  This means that using a larger input vocabulary consistently improves model performance.  **They achieve performance comparable to using double-sized baselines** with no extra cost.  The findings highlight the importance of tokenization in scaling laws and suggest new approaches for tokenizer design.", "affiliation": "Seed-Foundation-Model Team, Bytedance", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.16975/podcast.wav"}
