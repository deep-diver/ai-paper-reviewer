Existing methods often rely on dense guidance (depth maps, etc.), which limits their ability to handle variations in body shape between the reference and driving video and hinder the overall quality.  Sparse guidance (skeleton pose) is less restrictive but provides limited control.  The inconsistent quality and appearance is also a major issue.\nDisPose tackles these issues by disentangling sparse pose guidance into motion field estimation and keypoint correspondence.  It generates a dense motion field from a sparse motion field and the reference image, providing region-level dense guidance while maintaining the generalizability of sparse pose control.  It also extracts diffusion features from the reference image and transfers them to the target pose, preserving appearance consistency.  Experimental results demonstrate DisPose's improved quality and consistency over existing methods, showcasing its effectiveness and generalizability.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2412.09349/podcast.wav"}
