### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) hold promise for solving complex robotic manipulation tasks, but they often struggle with the intricacies of physical reasoning and long-horizon planning due to compounding errors. These limitations hinder their ability to perform intricate action sequences that require nuanced physical interactions. Therefore, there is a need to enhance VLMs' understanding of physics and ability to plan over extended horizons. 



This paper introduces a novel test-time computation framework, named ReflectVLM, that significantly enhances VLMs' capabilities for multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks. ReflectVLM iteratively improves a pre-trained VLM using a reflection mechanism and diffusion models to predict future world states, enabling the VLM to refine its decisions by examining the predicted outcomes of its proposed actions. Experiments demonstrate that ReflectVLM outperforms state-of-the-art commercial VLMs and traditional planning approaches.

> üîº The figure illustrates the reflective planning process.  A Vision-Language Model (VLM) initially suggests an action. A diffusion dynamics model then simulates the outcome of that action, predicting the future state of the environment. This prediction is fed back to the VLM, allowing it to reconsider its initial plan and potentially propose a more effective action. This iterative refinement process, using imagined future states, is what is meant by 'reflective planning'.

### In-depth insights


#### Reflective VLMs
**Reflective VLMs** enhance physical reasoning in robotic manipulation by iteratively improving pretrained VLMs with a 'reflection' mechanism. This involves using a generative model to **imagine future world states**, guiding action selection, and critically reflecting on potential suboptimalities to refine reasoning. The system leverages visual predictions and iterative refinement, enabling a more sophisticated understanding of physical constraints. By combining VLMs with reflection and targeted post-training, the system gains a better understanding of physical constraints and their implications for action planning. This approach contrasts with existing methods that primarily focus on language-only or visual comprehension tasks, by addressing physical reasoning and robotics applications through visual imagination and revision. The approach leverages internet-scale knowledge while overcoming limitations in physical reasoning and long-horizon planning. This combination of visual prediction and iterative refinement allows the VLM to improve its decision-making capabilities without requiring extensive retraining.

#### Test-Time Adapt
**Test-time adaptation** is crucial for deploying machine learning models in real-world scenarios where data distributions can shift. It involves adjusting the model's parameters or outputs on the fly, using only the input data encountered during deployment, without access to the original training data. This can be achieved through techniques like **self-training**, where the model iteratively refines its predictions by treating high-confidence outputs as pseudo-labels, or through **meta-learning** approaches that train the model to quickly adapt to new tasks. Effective test-time adaptation requires careful consideration of factors like the **adaptation rate**, the **regularization strength**, and the **potential for catastrophic forgetting**, where the model loses its previously learned knowledge while adapting to new data. Ultimately, successful test-time adaptation leads to more robust and reliable model performance in dynamic and uncertain environments.

#### Visual Dynamics
Visual dynamics, especially in the context of robotic manipulation, involve understanding how actions change the visual state of the environment. **Predicting these changes** is crucial for planning and control. Models that can accurately simulate the consequences of actions enable robots to **reason about potential outcomes** without physically executing them. These models can range from simple kinematic predictors to complex physics engines or learned models like diffusion models. The effectiveness of visual dynamics hinges on the **fidelity of the predictions**; a model that accurately captures the nuances of object interactions and environmental constraints will lead to better planning and execution. Incorporating visual dynamics into a robotic system typically involves a **learning phase**, where the model is trained on data of robot actions and their resulting visual changes. At inference, the model predicts how the environment will change given a sequence of actions, allowing the robot to select the most promising plan.

#### Assembly Tasks
The research paper addresses the intricate challenges of **robotic assembly**, focusing on multi-stage long-horizon manipulation. Assembly tasks, especially those involving interlocking parts, are central to evaluating the method's ability to reason about physical constraints and action sequences. **Performance in assembly demonstrates the model's understanding** of complex physical interactions and planning over extended horizons. Task complexity underscores the importance of reflection mechanisms for refining actions based on imagined outcomes. **Assembly provides a grounded environment** for assessing the VLM's capabilities in sequential decision-making and error recovery, highlighting the need for robust long-horizon manipulation.

#### Iterative Refine
The concept of iterative refinement, though not explicitly mentioned as a heading, is a powerful paradigm. It allows for the **successive approximation** of a solution, starting with an initial guess and improving it over multiple iterations. This is crucial when facing complex tasks where a direct, one-shot solution is difficult to obtain. In robotics, iterative refinement can be used to improve robot actions gradually and create a robust system. By iteratively **evaluating and correcting actions**, robots can learn to adapt to the complexities of the environment and achieve desired outcomes in dynamic and unpredictable conditions. The iterative refinement process also involves continuous **self-assessment** to identify shortcomings in the initial steps. By identifying these points of suboptimal action, it contributes to building a robust and generalizable planning system. This iterative process promotes increased precision and **resilience to unexpected situations.**

> üîº This figure illustrates how training data is generated for the reflection mechanism.  For each timestep in a rollout (a sequence of actions and observations), two training examples are created.  The first example (Q1, A1) consists of a question (Q1) that asks what action should be taken next, given the current and goal states and a history of previous actions. The answer (A1) is the action the expert policy would take in this situation.  The second example (Q2, A2) focuses on reflection. The question (Q2) is similar to Q1, but it adds the hypothetical future state that would result from taking the proposed action. This enables the VLM to learn to evaluate its proposed actions and revise them if the imagined future looks suboptimal.  'H' represents the number of steps the model is asked to look ahead into the future to make this evaluation, and 'h' represents the length of the history of previous actions considered.

> üîº The figure showcases the architecture of the Diffusion Dynamics Model (DDM), a key component in the Reflective Planning framework.  The DDM uses a diffusion process to predict future visual states based on current observations and planned actions. It comprises four main parts: a latent encoder and a text encoder (both frozen during training), a Diffusion UNet, and a latent decoder. The latent encoder converts image inputs into latent representations.  Concurrently, the text encoder processes the action text into a corresponding representation.  Both latent representations are fed into the Diffusion UNet which performs the core diffusion process, refining the noise added to the latent image representation. Finally, the latent decoder reconstructs a visual representation from the refined latent representation output by the UNet. Only the Diffusion UNet and the latent decoder are fine-tuned on task data; the encoder components remain frozen to leverage their pre-trained knowledge.  The symbol ùí© denotes the addition of random noise during the diffusion process.

The red border around one of the images highlights a key moment (timestep 15) where the VLM initially suggested picking up a purple brick but reconsidered after using its reflection mechanism to visualize the next steps. The reflection process showed that picking up the purple brick would not lead to progress towards the goal; therefore, the VLM corrected its action to pick up the yellow brick.

The ReflectVLM method uses the same amount of labeled data and maintains computational efficiency compared to existing methods.  ReflectVLM significantly outperforms all baselines.
