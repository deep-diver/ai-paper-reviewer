These limitations hinder their ability to perform intricate action sequences that require nuanced physical interactions. Therefore, there is a need to enhance VLMs' understanding of physics and ability to plan over extended horizons. \n\nThis paper introduces a novel test-time computation framework, named ReflectVLM, that significantly enhances VLMs' capabilities for multi-stage robotic manipulation tasks. ReflectVLM iteratively improves a pre-trained VLM using a reflection mechanism and diffusion models to predict future world states, enabling the VLM to refine its decisions by examining the predicted outcomes of its proposed actions. Experiments demonstrate that ReflectVLM outperforms state-of-the-art commercial VLMs and traditional planning approaches.", "affiliation": "Cornell University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2502.16707/podcast.wav"}
