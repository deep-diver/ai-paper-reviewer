Memories are retrieved before an agent takes certain actions, and are updated after certain events.", "description": "The figure illustrates the MOSAIC framework, a multi-agent simulation modeling social media content dissemination and user responses.  Agents, each with unique characteristics derived from human surveys or synthetic data, interact on a simulated social network.  The framework simulates how agents post, share, like, comment on, and flag content, incorporating community-based, third-party, or hybrid fact-checking.  Agent behaviors are dynamically shaped by their memories, which are updated based on their experiences. This allows for the study of content spread, misinformation, and the effectiveness of different content moderation strategies.", "section": "2 Social Network Simulation"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.07830/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Average engagement received per post: Human vs. Agents.

A positive value indicates that factual content received more engagement than misinformation, while a negative value signifies the opposite.
