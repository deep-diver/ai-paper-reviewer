Many existing approaches rely on explicit communication protocols or centralized control, which can be inefficient and limit scalability.  This often leads to deadlocks or suboptimal solutions in complex scenarios. \nThis paper proposes SRMT (Shared Recurrent Memory Transformer), a novel approach that addresses these issues.  SRMT uses a shared memory space to enable implicit communication between agents. Each agent maintains its own working memory and updates the shared space, allowing for indirect information exchange and improved coordination.  Experiments demonstrate SRMT's effectiveness in a challenging multi-agent pathfinding task, outperforming traditional methods and showing strong generalization to unseen environments and scalability to larger problems.", "affiliation": "AIRI", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2501.13200/podcast.wav"}
