Diffusion-based models, while effective, lack explicit causal modeling.  There is also a need for more efficient training and inference strategies.\nThis paper introduces Step-Video-T2V, a 30B parameter model addressing these challenges.  It utilizes a deep compression VAE for efficient video representation, bilingual text encoders, and a DiT with 3D full attention for improved video generation.  A novel Video-DPO approach enhances visual quality, and a new benchmark dataset, Step-Video-T2V-Eval, enables fair comparisons with other models. The model and dataset are open-sourced, advancing the field.", "affiliation": "Step-Video Team", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.10248/podcast.wav"}
