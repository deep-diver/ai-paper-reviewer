A standalone generative model often produces highly diverse trajectories with no clear boundaries between different modalities.

A standalone generative model is shown to produce a wide range of trajectories that blend together without clear distinctions between different driving behaviors (e.g., turning left vs. going straight).  In contrast, the 'Goal-Driven Generation Model' uses goal points to guide the trajectory generation process, resulting in distinct trajectory clusters, each corresponding to a different driving maneuver.  The use of goal points effectively separates the different trajectory modalities, leading to improved clarity and quality of the generated paths.", "section": "1.

The Perception Module takes image and LiDAR data as input, processing them to generate a Bird's Eye View (BEV) feature representation, denoted as  Fbev. This BEV feature is then passed to the Goal Point Construction Module. This module utilizes a Goal Point Vocabulary (a set of potential goal points) to identify the optimal goal point for trajectory generation, using a scoring mechanism. The selected goal point is then given to the Trajectory Planning Module, which uses a denoising process to generate multiple trajectory candidates starting from a Gaussian distribution and converging towards the target distribution. These candidates are then evaluated by a Trajectory Scorer, which selects the single best trajectory.", "section": "3.2 GoalFlow"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.05689/x3.png", "caption": "(a)", "description": "This figure shows the detailed structure of the Goal Point Construction Module.
