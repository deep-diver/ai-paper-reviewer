Existing solutions like KV cache disaggregation and sparse attention have limitations in simultaneously optimizing generation quality, latency, and resource usage. This paper addresses the challenges in long-context LLM inference, where existing systems struggle to balance generation quality, latency, and resource consumption.\n\nThis paper introduces **AlayaDB, a novel vector database system designed to decouple KV cache and attention computation** from the LLM inference engine. AlayaDB introduces a novel query type called dynamic inner product range query (DIPR) to capture the dynamic nature of sparse attention, and the co-optimization enables reduced resource consumption, lower latency, and higher generation quality.", "affiliation": "AlayaDB.AI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.10326/podcast.wav"}
