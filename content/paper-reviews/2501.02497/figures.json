System-1 models are perceptual and primarily utilize test-time adaptation to handle distribution shifts, using methods such as parameter updates, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration.  In contrast, System-2 models are cognitive and focus on test-time reasoning, involving techniques like repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search to solve complex problems. The figure visually represents these two approaches, highlighting the different strategies employed in each system.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.02497/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Taxonomy of test-time computing methods and future directions.", "description": "This figure provides a taxonomy of existing test-time computing methods, categorized by whether they are applied to System-1 or System-2 models and further divided into subcategories such as parameter updating, input modification, and representation editing.  It visually illustrates the progression from System-1 to System-2 thinking enabled by test-time computing, highlighting the transition from basic perceptual tasks to more complex reasoning and planning. The bottom portion of the figure also outlines promising future research directions within this field, including generalization, multi-modality, efficiency improvements, scaling laws, and novel combination strategies of existing techniques.", "section": "Test-time Computing"}]
