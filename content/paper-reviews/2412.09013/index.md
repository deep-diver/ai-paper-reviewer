### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Image super-resolution (SR) aims to enhance low-resolution images.  Existing diffusion model-based SR methods often involve complex optimization or fine-tuning, limiting efficiency and flexibility.  Furthermore, fixed sampling steps hinder adaptability to diverse degradation types. 

This paper introduces InvSR, a novel SR technique based on diffusion inversion.  Instead of modifying the diffusion network, InvSR uses a deep noise predictor to estimate optimal noise maps, initializing the sampling process and generating high-resolution images.  This approach allows for **arbitrary sampling steps**, providing great flexibility and efficiency, making it suitable for various degradation types.  InvSR shows competitive or superior performance to existing methods, even with a single sampling step.

> üîº This figure showcases a comparison between the proposed image super-resolution (SR) method and other state-of-the-art diffusion-based SR methods. Two real-world examples are used for the comparison. The number of sampling steps used for each method is indicated.  The first example demonstrates that for blurry images, multiple sampling steps progressively improve the result with finer details.  The second example, however, shows that a single sampling step is preferable for images with noise as additional steps may exacerbate it.  Runtimes for the various methods on an A100 GPU are shown for the first example's x4 (128 to 512 pixels) super-resolution task. The proposed method is highlighted as offering a flexible and efficient sampling process that can be adjusted according to the image's degradation.

Our method offers an efficient and flexible sampling mechanism, allowing users to freely adjust the number of sampling steps based on the degradation type or their specific requirements. In the first example, mainly degraded by blurriness, multi-step sampling is preferable to single-step sampling as it progressively recovers finer details. Conversely, in the second example with severe noise, a single sampling step is sufficient to achieve satisfactory results, whereas additional steps may amplify the noise and introduce unwanted artifacts.

### In-depth insights


#### Diffusion Inversion SR
Diffusion Inversion for Super-Resolution (SR) leverages the power of pre-trained diffusion models to overcome the ill-posed nature of SR.  Unlike methods modifying the diffusion model itself, **diffusion inversion aims to find the optimal noise map that, when fed into the pre-trained model, generates the high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) input.** This approach maximizes the utilization of the existing diffusion model's rich image priors.  A key challenge is the computational cost of calculating noise maps for many diffusion steps. To address this, the technique of **partial noise prediction** is introduced. This cleverly reduces the computational load by focusing on predicting only the starting noise map, significantly improving efficiency.  The method demonstrates **flexibility** by allowing for varying numbers of sampling steps, adapting to different degradation types and offering a trade-off between computational speed and reconstruction fidelity.  **This adaptability makes it superior to methods relying on fixed sampling steps.**  Overall, diffusion inversion offers a promising and efficient path towards high-fidelity SR, particularly by capitalizing on readily available, powerful pre-trained diffusion models.

#### Partial Noise Prediction
The concept of "Partial Noise Prediction" in the context of image super-resolution via diffusion inversion is a **key innovation** that addresses computational complexity.  Traditional diffusion-based SR methods often involve predicting noise maps for every step of the diffusion process, making them computationally expensive.  **Partial Noise Prediction cleverly bypasses this by focusing on predicting noise maps only for an intermediate state** of the diffusion process, a point chosen strategically for an optimal balance between fidelity and efficiency. This is motivated by the observation that low-resolution (LR) images differ from high-resolution (HR) images primarily in high-frequency details.  The intermediate state acts as a shortcut in the inversion trajectory, enabling the use of fewer steps in generating the HR image while maintaining a satisfactory quality.  The effectiveness of this method relies on a well-trained noise predictor that can accurately estimate the optimal noise maps for initializing the sampling process, therefore requiring high-quality training data.   This approach greatly **reduces computational cost** without significantly sacrificing the quality of the super-resolved images, making it a more practical solution for real-world applications. The flexibility to choose from several pre-defined starting points also makes the method robust to different degradation types.

#### Arbitrary Steps Sampling
The concept of "Arbitrary Steps Sampling" in image super-resolution (SR) using diffusion models offers a significant advantage over traditional fixed-step methods.  **Flexibility** is key; it allows the model to adapt the number of sampling steps to the specific characteristics of the input image and its degradation type.  This contrasts with fixed-step approaches that often struggle with varying degradation levels, leading to suboptimal results. **Efficiency** is another major benefit, as fewer steps are needed for less complex images, saving computation time. The ability to adjust the number of steps based on image quality is crucial, as it allows for **optimal balance between detail recovery and noise amplification.** For instance, blurry images might benefit from multiple steps to recover fine details, while noisy images might be best served by a single step to avoid noise amplification.  **This adaptability is a crucial step towards creating more robust and efficient SR models** that generalize well across diverse real-world scenarios.

#### InvSR Efficiency Analysis
An InvSR efficiency analysis would reveal crucial insights into its computational cost.  **Speed** is paramount; comparing InvSR's inference time to existing SR methods (GAN-based, diffusion-based) is key.  A breakdown of runtime components (noise prediction, sampling steps) would highlight bottlenecks.  **Memory usage** is another critical factor, especially for high-resolution images.  Analyzing memory allocation during each stage (noise estimation, diffusion process) is vital.  **Parameter count** should also be considered; a smaller model size translates to faster processing and lower resource demands.  **Scalability** should be assessed: does performance degrade significantly with increasing image size or complexity?  Finally, an analysis should explore **hardware acceleration** opportunities (GPU utilization, optimized kernels) to minimize the execution time, potentially revealing further improvements.

#### Future Research Scope
Future research could explore **improving the efficiency of the noise predictor** by employing more lightweight network architectures or more efficient training strategies.  Investigating **alternative sampling algorithms** beyond those currently used, potentially incorporating techniques from other generative models, is crucial for further enhancing efficiency and flexibility.  A key area for future work involves **handling diverse degradation types** more effectively. While this paper addresses blur and noise, a more robust method capable of adapting to diverse and complex real-world degradations is needed.  Finally, the **exploration of different diffusion models** and their effect on SR performance warrants further investigation, including testing on models beyond Stable Diffusion to assess the approach's generalizability and potentially improving quality and efficiency.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the inference process of the proposed image super-resolution method.  The input is a low-resolution (LR) image. A noise predictor network (fw) estimates the initial noise map (zœÑS) needed to start the reverse diffusion process.  This initial noise map is added to a scaled version of the LR image, creating the starting point for the sampling process. The reverse diffusion process, using a pre-trained diffusion model, then iteratively refines this initial estimate to generate the final high-resolution (HR) image. The figure highlights that the predicted initial noise map (zœÑS) shows a strong correlation with the input LR image, exhibiting a non-zero mean in its statistical distribution, which is unusual for typical diffusion processes.

> üîº This table presents a quantitative comparison of the performance of the proposed InvSR model using two different pre-trained diffusion models as its base: Stable Diffusion 2.0 and Stable Diffusion Turbo. The comparison is done on the ImageNet-Test dataset and uses several metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, NIQE, PI, CLIPIQA, and MUSIQ to evaluate the image quality of super-resolution results.  The results are shown for different numbers of sampling steps to demonstrate the effect of this parameter on the final output.  This helps in understanding how the choice of base model and the number of sampling steps affect the performance of the InvSR model.

The comparison focuses on the speed of the algorithms when performing a 4x upscaling task (increasing the resolution from 128x128 to 512x512 pixels). The runtime was measured using an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 40GB of memory. For methods that utilize diffusion models, the number of sampling steps employed is also specified. This table helps to illustrate the trade-off between model complexity (as indicated by the number of parameters), computational time, and the quality of super-resolution achieved.
