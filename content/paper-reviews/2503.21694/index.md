### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Generating 3D meshes from text prompts is challenging because of insufficient high-quality 3D training data. Existing methods adapting text-to-image diffusion models for 3D often yield poor results. This is due to the limited size and quality of available 3D datasets, which affects the models' ability to generalize across diverse textual descriptions and produce consistent 3D outputs. These models need multi-view consistent, better texture and geometry. 



To solve this, this paper introduces Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD). This approach adapts Stable Diffusion for native 3D generation without 3D ground truths by distilling knowledge from multi-view diffusion models. PRD incorporates Parameter-Efficient Triplane Adaptation (PETA) which adds only 2.5% trainable parameters to the frozen SD, allowing efficient adaptation for 3D generation. This leads to TriplaneTurbo, it surpasses existing methods in both quality and speed, by generating textured 3D meshes in approximately 1.2 seconds.

### In-depth insights


#### SD Adaptation
**Adapting Stable Diffusion (SD) for 3D generation** is a promising avenue, leveraging SD's robust text-image priors. Methods involve fine-tuning or distillation. The challenge lies in **efficiently transferring SD's knowledge** to 3D representations, such as Triplanes, without extensive 3D training data. This adaptation aims to create high-quality 3D models from text prompts, rivaling traditional methods like NeRF optimization. SD Adaptation enhances generalization and reduces training costs, making 3D creation more accessible and faster. SD adaptation helps generating 3D content, even if multi-view inconsistency exists or the issue of the Janus problem arises.

#### PRD: 3D Data-Free
**PRD: 3D Data-Free** represents a significant leap in text-to-3D generation by eliminating the need for expensive and often limited 3D training datasets. The core idea revolves around **distilling knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models**, like Stable Diffusion, and multi-view diffusion models. By leveraging the rich generative priors learned from vast image datasets, PRD can effectively guide the creation of 3D meshes without directly supervising the training process with 3D ground truth. This **data-free approach unlocks several key advantages:** it dramatically reduces the cost and complexity of training, allows for easier scaling to larger and more diverse datasets of text prompts, and circumvents the limitations imposed by the quality and biases of existing 3D datasets. The method addresses the bottleneck of 3D data scarcity, enabling the generation of high-quality and consistent 3D assets from text descriptions more efficiently and effectively. This has implications for content creation and virtual world development.

#### PETA: <3% Params
The concept of "PETA: <3% Params" likely refers to a Parameter-Efficient Transfer learning Approach (PETA) used in the research. This suggests a methodology where a pre-trained model, possibly a large one, is adapted to a new task or domain by only training a small fraction of its parameters. The significance lies in **reducing computational costs and memory footprint** during training, making it feasible to fine-tune large models on limited resources. A parameter budget of less than 3% implies a highly efficient adaptation strategy, likely involving techniques like **low-rank adaptation (LoRA), adapter modules, or selective parameter freezing**. The benefits include faster training times, reduced GPU memory requirements, and potentially better generalization performance compared to full fine-tuning. This approach is particularly relevant when dealing with large pre-trained models where **full fine-tuning is computationally prohibitive**, while still achieving comparable or superior results.

#### Multi-View Diff.
Multi-view diffusion is a crucial element in generating **consistent 3D structures** from text prompts. It addresses the Janus problem by ensuring different viewpoints align and complement each other. Techniques involve **camera-aware adaptations**, **synchronized multi-view generation**, and incorporating modalities like normals and depth maps. While multi-view diffusion improves geometric quality and consistency, it often introduces computational bottlenecks due to intensive score distillation or 3D reconstruction. Balancing multi-view consistency with computational efficiency remains a key challenge, necessitating innovations in both model architecture and training strategies.

#### Limited # Obj.
The limited number of objects, particularly in 3D datasets, significantly constrains the **generalizability** of text-to-3D models. The paucity of diverse and high-quality 3D data hinders the ability of these models to accurately translate complex textual descriptions into corresponding 3D representations. This data bottleneck forces models to rely heavily on priors learned from smaller datasets, resulting in outputs that often lack the **nuance and detail** present in the text prompts. Overcoming this limitation requires innovative strategies like data augmentation, transfer learning from 2D models, or the development of novel training schemes that can effectively leverage limited data while still producing high-fidelity 3D content. Data-free distillation methods can also overcome this issue by transferring knowledge from multi-view diffusion models into SD-adapted native 3D generators.

> 🔼 Figure 2 illustrates the core difference between traditional Stable Diffusion (SD) adaptation for 3D generation and the proposed Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD) method.  Traditional methods require ground truth 3D data (θ) and their corresponding latent codes (z₀) to train the model, using these to generate new latent codes (z₀).  In contrast, PRD eliminates the need for ground truth 3D data. Instead, it progressively denoises latent codes (zₜ) starting from random noise, iteratively refining them towards z₀, which are then decoded into 3D representations (θ).  Multi-view diffusion models guide this denoising process through distillation, transferring knowledge without explicit 3D supervision. This data-free approach addresses the scarcity of high-quality 3D training data.

> 🔼 Figure 3 illustrates TriplaneTurbo, a novel 3D mesh generator built by adapting Stable Diffusion (SD).  Unlike training a 3D generator from scratch, TriplaneTurbo leverages the pre-trained capabilities of SD, significantly reducing training time and data requirements. The core of the method is Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD), which uses multi-view teacher models to guide the adaptation without relying on 3D ground truth data.  The architecture generates six feature planes in four steps: two Triplanes (one for geometry and one for texture) and four accompanying features.  The Parameter-Efficient Triplane Adaptation (PETA) method only adds 2.5% additional trainable parameters to the pre-trained SD model, keeping the adaptation computationally efficient.

> 🔼 This ablation study investigates the impact of using both volume rendering and mesh rasterization for supervising the training of the 3D generator. The results show that using only volume rendering leads to training instability and failure to generate valid meshes. Conversely, only using mesh rasterization results in low-quality mesh geometry and texture. The study demonstrates that combining both methods is crucial for achieving stable training and high-quality 3D generation.

It shows how different numbers of denoising steps (K) in the PRD algorithm affect the quality of generated 3D models, as measured by CLIP Score (C.S.) and CLIP R-precision (R@1). The results demonstrate the impact of the hyperparameter K on the model's performance.
