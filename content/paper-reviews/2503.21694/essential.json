{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it **addresses the data scarcity** issue in text-to-3D mesh generation by using a novel Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD) training scheme. It also introduces Parameter-Efficient Triplane Adaptation (PETA), which reduces computational costs and enables high-quality 3D mesh generation with shorter time, opening new directions for future research. Thus, other related generation tasks can be inspired.", "summary": "Adapting Stable Diffusion for faster Text-to-Mesh Generation, PRD efficiently creates high-quality 3D models without needing extensive 3D training data.", "takeaways": ["PRD enables high-quality 3D mesh generation from text prompts without requiring 3D ground-truth data.", "The method trains a Triplane generator, TriplaneTurbo, which rapidly generates 3D meshes, only 1.2 seconds.", "The PETA efficiently adapts pre-trained 2D diffusion models for native 3D generation by adding only 2.5% trainable parameters."], "tldr": "Generating 3D meshes from text prompts is challenging because of insufficient high-quality 3D training data. Existing methods adapting text-to-image diffusion models for 3D often yield poor results. This is due to the limited size and quality of available 3D datasets, which affects the models' ability to generalize across diverse textual descriptions and produce consistent 3D outputs. These models need multi-view consistent, better texture and geometry. \n\nTo solve this, this paper introduces Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD). This approach adapts Stable Diffusion for native 3D generation without 3D ground truths by distilling knowledge from multi-view diffusion models. PRD incorporates Parameter-Efficient Triplane Adaptation (PETA) which adds only 2.5% trainable parameters to the frozen SD, allowing efficient adaptation for 3D generation. This leads to TriplaneTurbo, it surpasses existing methods in both quality and speed, by generating textured 3D meshes in approximately 1.2 seconds.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21694/podcast.wav"}
