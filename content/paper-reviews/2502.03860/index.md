### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning using "Long Chain of Thought" (LongCoT) heavily rely on knowledge distillation from existing, powerful models or expensive human annotations. This creates bottlenecks in the systematic development and scalability of LongCoT abilities.  Furthermore, many existing approaches narrowly focus on math or coding tasks, limiting their generalizability. 

This paper introduces BOLT (Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought), a novel approach that enables LLMs to exhibit LongCoT reasoning without distillation or extensive human annotation.  BOLT involves a three-stage process: 1) bootstrapping LongCoT data using in-context learning on a standard instruct model; 2) supervised fine-tuning on the generated data to adapt the model; 3) online training to refine LongCoT capabilities further. The experiments demonstrate the efficiency of this approach with only 10 examples used in the bootstrapping stage and achieves remarkable results across diverse benchmarks, surpassing previous methods and showcasing scalability across model sizes (7B, 8B, 70B).

> üîº The figure illustrates the BOLT (Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought) framework, a three-stage process for training language models to generate long chains of reasoning.  Stage 1, LongCoT Bootstrapping, uses a ShortCoT (short chain-of-thought) language model and a small number of in-context examples to generate LongCoT data. This data is then used in Stage 2, LongCoT Supervised Finetuning, to train a ShortCoT model on the LongCoT format, encouraging it to generate richer reasoning before providing an answer. Finally, Stage 3, LongCoT Online Training, refines the model's LongCoT capabilities through online learning and feedback using an Outcome Reward Model (ORM) to evaluate the quality of answers. The ORM assesses the quality of the final solution generated by the model.

BOLT comprises three stages: 1) LongCoT Bootstrapping which involves synthesizing LongCoT data, 2) LongCoT Supervised Finetuning where we train a ShortCoT model to adapt to the LongCoT format, incorporating reasoning elements and practicing extended chains of thought before arriving at an external solution, 3) LongCoT Online Training where the LongCoT SFT model is further improved through online exploration and refinement. Bootstrapping LLM is a ShortCoT LLM that is used to generate LongCoT data via in-context learning. ORM is an outcome reward model which scores the external solution in the model response.

### In-depth insights


#### LongCoT Reasoning
Long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, as demonstrated by models like OpenAI's o1, signifies a significant advancement in large language models (LLMs).  **LongCoT empowers LLMs to solve complex problems by generating an extended chain of reasoning steps before arriving at a final answer.** This process mirrors human problem-solving, involving planning, reflection, and error correction.  However, replicating LongCoT capabilities has proven challenging.  **Existing methods primarily rely on knowledge distillation, using data from already-capable models, limiting the understanding of how to systematically develop such reasoning abilities from scratch.**  The reliance on distillation creates a black box;  **researchers lack a clear picture of how LongCoT emerges without direct transfer learning from pre-trained models.** This paper, therefore, proposes a novel, bootstrap approach to overcome this limitation, offering a white-box alternative to the knowledge distillation approach and paving the way for future research to more completely understand and develop this critical capability in LLMs.

#### BOLT Framework
The BOLT framework presents a novel approach to bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reasoning in Language Models (LLMs) without relying on distillation from existing LongCoT models or extensive human annotations.  **It leverages a three-stage process:** 1) LongCoT data bootstrapping via in-context learning from a standard instruct model, requiring minimal example creation; 2) LongCoT supervised fine-tuning to adapt a ShortCoT model to the LongCoT format; and 3) online training to further refine LongCoT capabilities.  **The framework's strength lies in its efficiency and scalability**, demonstrated by impressive performance improvements across various model sizes and diverse benchmarks.  **Its white-box nature**, unlike black-box distillation methods, offers greater transparency and understanding of how LongCoT reasoning is developed.  The open-sourcing of training data and models further promotes future research and wider adoption, **offering a cost-effective pathway for cultivating advanced reasoning skills** in LLMs.

#### Empirical Results
An Empirical Results section in a research paper would typically present quantitative or qualitative findings that support or refute the study's hypotheses.  A thoughtful analysis would delve into the specific metrics used, examining their appropriateness and limitations. **Statistical significance** of results should be highlighted, along with consideration of effect sizes.  Furthermore, a critical review would explore potential confounding variables or biases that could affect the interpretation of findings.  It's crucial to assess the robustness of the results by examining whether they hold across various subgroups or under different conditions.  Finally, a comprehensive summary would connect the empirical findings back to the research questions and theoretical framework, discussing their implications and limitations in advancing knowledge within the field.

#### Ablation Studies
Ablation studies systematically remove or alter components of a model to understand their individual contributions and effects on overall performance.  In this context, they would likely involve removing or modifying specific stages of the BOLT (Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought) process‚ÄîLongCoT bootstrapping, LongCoT supervised finetuning, or LongCoT online training‚Äîto assess their individual importance. **Removing the bootstrapping stage would test the feasibility of generating LongCoT data from scratch.**  Modifying or removing finetuning would isolate the impact of supervised learning on adapting a short-chain model to long-chain reasoning.  Finally, removing online training would assess the role of reinforcement learning in refinement. By analyzing performance differences across these variations, researchers gain crucial insight into the relative contribution of each component and identify critical factors driving the model's success.  **Results would reveal which parts are most essential for generating high-quality LongCoT responses**, guiding future model improvements and potentially simplifying the model architecture by eliminating less important elements.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending BOLT to other LLMs** beyond the ones tested is crucial to assess its generalizability and effectiveness across different architectures and scales.  **Investigating the minimal number of in-context examples** needed for successful bootstrapping, and how that number scales with model size or task complexity, warrants further research.  **Improving the efficiency of the online training phase** is also important.  Exploring different reward model designs and reinforcement learning algorithms could lead to faster convergence and better LongCoT capabilities. Finally, this work could be extended to understand the theoretical underpinnings of the effectiveness of the BOLT approach in fostering long-chain reasoning. A deeper theoretical understanding can offer valuable insights into how to systematically design and train more capable reasoning LLMs.
