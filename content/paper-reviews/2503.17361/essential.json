Existing methods struggle with scaling to higher dimensions and lack effective controllability during inference. To solve this, the paper tackles these limitations by introducing a framework that improves sequence generation in discrete spaces. \n\nThe paper introduces **Gumbel-Softmax Flow Matching**, which defines a novel Gumbel-Softmax interpolant with a time-dependent temperature parameter. This allows for high-quality, diverse generation and efficient scaling. Additionally, **Straight-Through Guided Flows** enables training-free guidance, steering the velocity field toward optimal sequence vertices. The framework is shown to be effective in DNA promoter design, protein generation, and target-binding peptide design.", "affiliation": "Department of Biomedical Engineering, Duke University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17361/podcast.wav"}
