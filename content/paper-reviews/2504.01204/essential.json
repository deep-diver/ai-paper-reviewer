Recent video generation models offer a promising solution, but struggle with generating high-fidelity dynamics for real-world objects and preserving 3D structure consistency, often resulting in physically implausible articulated motion. Existing text-to-4D generation methods use neural deformation fields, which introduce a large number of degrees of freedom, making optimization challenging and leading to suboptimal quality. \n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces **Articulated Kinematics Distillation (AKD)**, a novel framework for generating high-fidelity character animations. AKD bridges traditional character animation pipelines and generative motion synthesis by distilling articulated motion sequences from pre-trained video diffusion models using Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). AKD simplifies the distillation process by limiting the number of degrees of freedom to that of a few joints, offering effective regularization of the deformation space and compatibility with physics-based simulation, ensuring physical plausibility.", "affiliation": "UCLA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.01204/podcast.wav"}
