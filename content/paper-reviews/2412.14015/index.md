### In-depth insights


#### Prompting 4K Depth
**Prompting 4K Depth** explores a novel paradigm in depth estimation by leveraging the power of foundation models like Depth Anything.  Instead of training from scratch, the model is **prompted** with low-cost LiDAR data, serving as a metric guide.  This approach allows for achieving **high-resolution (4K) metric depth** estimation, overcoming limitations of traditional monocular methods.  Key innovations include a **multi-scale prompt fusion architecture** within the model's decoder, effectively integrating LiDAR information.  The training process addresses data scarcity by using synthetic LiDAR simulation and pseudo ground truth generation. Results on ARKitScenes and ScanNet++ demonstrate **state-of-the-art performance**, highlighting the potential of this prompting approach for various applications, including 3D reconstruction and robotic grasping.

#### LiDAR Fusion Arch.
**LiDAR Fusion Arch.** would explore innovative architectures for integrating LiDAR data into depth estimation models.  A key challenge is effectively fusing the **sparse, noisy LiDAR data** with the **dense image information**. Architectures could range from simple concatenation to more sophisticated attention mechanisms, leveraging transformers or graph neural networks to exploit spatial relationships.  Multi-scale fusion, incorporating LiDAR at different resolutions, might further improve accuracy and robustness.  Designing lightweight, real-time compatible architectures would be crucial for practical applications like robotics and augmented reality.

#### Scalable Data Pipeline
The **scalable data pipeline** addresses the challenge of training data scarcity for metric depth estimation.  Existing datasets lack either LiDAR data or accurate ground truth.  This pipeline enhances **data diversity and quality** through two key processes.  First, it **simulates low-resolution, noisy LiDAR** data for synthetic datasets with precise ground truth, making them suitable for training. Second, it generates **pseudo ground truth** for real-world LiDAR datasets lacking accurate depth annotations by employing 3D reconstruction. This innovative approach ensures the pipeline's **scalability and robustness**, producing high-quality training data for diverse scenarios and ultimately enabling more accurate metric depth estimation.

#### Edge-Aware Depth
**Edge-aware depth estimation** focuses on accurately predicting depth values, especially at object boundaries and edges where depth discontinuities occur.  Traditional methods often smooth over these edges, leading to blurry or inaccurate depth maps.  However, preserving edge information is **crucial** for various applications like 3D reconstruction, object recognition, and scene understanding.  By incorporating edge information, the depth estimation model can produce sharper, more realistic depth maps.  This can be achieved by incorporating **edge detection** or **image gradients** into the depth estimation pipeline, or by using specific loss functions that penalize errors at edges more heavily.  Edge-aware depth estimation significantly improves the **quality** and **usefulness** of depth maps, enabling more accurate and detailed representations of the 3D world.

#### Zero-Shot Transfer
**Zero-shot transfer** in depth estimation aims to apply a model trained on one dataset to a new, unseen dataset without further training.  This capability is crucial for **generalization** and **real-world deployment**, where retraining on every new environment is impractical.  Achieving robust zero-shot performance requires models to learn **intrinsic scene properties** rather than overfit to specific dataset characteristics. This can be facilitated by diverse training data, suitable model architectures, and training procedures that encourage generalization, like appropriate data augmentation and regularization techniques.  While some progress has been made, significant challenges remain, particularly in handling variations in lighting, texture, and object types across different datasets. Robust zero-shot transfer remains a key area for future research, promising more **versatile and adaptable depth estimation models**.

> üîº Prompt Depth Anything uses a low-cost LiDAR as a prompt to guide a depth foundation model for accurate metric depth output, achieving a resolution up to 4K. This is achieved using a multi-scale prompt fusion design within the model's architecture, specifically a DPT decoder. The training process involves a scalable data pipeline that addresses the challenge of limited datasets containing both LiDAR and precise ground truth depth. This pipeline uses synthetic data LiDAR simulation, real data pseudo ground truth depth generation, and an edge-aware depth loss function that leverages pseudo and annotated ground truth data.

(b) Since training requires both low-cost LiDAR and precise GT depth, we propose a scalable data pipeline that simulates LiDAR depth for synthetic data with precise GT depth, and generates pseudo GT depth for real data with LiDAR.

The naive approach involves directly downsampling the high-resolution depth map to a lower resolution, which fails to capture the noise characteristics of real LiDAR data. In contrast, the sparse anchor interpolation method first downsamples the depth map and then samples points on this map using a distorted grid. The remaining depth values are interpolated from these sampled points using RGB similarity with KNN. This approach effectively simulates the noise present in real LiDAR data, resulting in more realistic simulated LiDAR depth maps for training depth estimation models. The figure includes visualizations of RGB image patch, full RGB image, depth output from the proposed model, and depth from ARKit.

> üîº This table presents a quantitative evaluation of various depth estimation models on the ScanNet++ dataset. The metrics used for evaluation include L1, RMSE, AbsRel, Accuracy (Acc.), Completeness (Comp.), Precision (Prec.), Recall, and F-score.  The table categorizes the models based on their usage of LiDAR data (Net.: Network Fusion; Post.: Post-alignment; w/o LiDAR: metric depth output without LiDAR input). Some models were finetuned using additional datasets (ARKitScenes and ScanNet++). The zero-shot models, denoted as 'Ourssyn' and others, were trained on synthetic data only. The table aims to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method, 'Ours,' in comparison to existing state-of-the-art methods for depth estimation.

> üîº This table presents the ablation study results of the proposed method, Prompt Depth Anything,  quantitatively evaluated on ARKitScenes and ScanNet++ datasets using L1, AbsRel, Acc, Comp, and F-score metrics.  Different settings are explored including: using synthetic data only,  removing prompting, removing foundation model pre-training, using different prompting architectures (AdaLN, Cross-Attention, and ControlNet), and using and combining different real datasets (ARKitScenes and ScanNet++ with annotated and pseudo ground truth).  The table analyzes the impact of prompting a depth foundation model, different architecture designs, training data, and an edge-aware loss on the performance.

> üîº This table presents the grasping success rates of a robotic arm attempting to grasp various objects (Red Can, Green Can, Transparent, Specular) placed at different distances (Near, Mid, and Far). The grasping policy used was trained only on diffusive objects (red and green cans). The success rate is evaluated by how often the robot places each object into the designated box from the positions near, middle, and far. The table shows that depth data obtained from the proposed model generally exhibits better performance compared to using RGB images or LiDAR depth from the iPhone, especially for grasping transparent or specular objects.

It shows that using Depth Anything as the base model yields better performance, as indicated in row (a). It also shows that while DepthPro (with prompting) in row (b) performs better than the original Depth Pro in row (c), it still doesn't match the performance of Depth Anything with prompting in row (a).
