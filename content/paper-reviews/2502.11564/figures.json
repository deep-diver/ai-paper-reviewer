We compare Bits Per Character (BPC) on the Text8 test set.", "description": "This figure compares the performance of three different training objective functions for a continuous diffusion model on the Text8 dataset.  The three objectives are minimizing the mean squared error of the drift approximation, minimizing the cross-entropy between the predicted probability vector and the target one-hot vector, and the cross-entropy with importance sampling. The results are presented as Bits Per Character (BPC) on the Text8 test set. The figure shows that the cross-entropy method with importance sampling achieves the best performance, followed by cross-entropy, with the mean squared error performing the worst.", "section": "Simulation-Free Training with Radial Symmetry"}]
