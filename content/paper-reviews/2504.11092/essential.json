Existing methods rely on geometric or generative priors, but they often overlook the benefits of both. Relying solely on geometric priors can lead to suboptimal results because these priors are not consistently reliable, while generative priors might overlook geometric accuracy. Moreover, existing generative models require large datasets of posed images which are difficult to obtain for dynamic scenes.\n\nVivid4D tackles this by integrating geometric and generative priors. It reformulates view augmentation as a video inpainting task: Observed views are warped into new viewpoints based on monocular depth priors, and then a video diffusion model inpaints missing regions to ensure spatial-temporal consistency. The method includes an iterative view augmentation strategy and a robust reconstruction loss, maximizing scene coverage while compensating for inaccurate depth priors. Experiments demonstrate that Vivid4D effectively improves monocular 4D scene reconstruction and completion.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.11092/podcast.wav"}
