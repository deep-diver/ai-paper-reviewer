It showcases how SocioVerse addresses alignment challenges across four key areas: the simulated environment's alignment with real-world conditions (accurate representation of the geopolitical landscape and news cycle); the simulated users' accurate representation of real-world users (in terms of demographics, beliefs and opinions) the scenarios' realism (reflecting different interaction formats such as surveys and interviews); and finally, alignment between simulated and real-world behaviors. The diagram depicts the various components such as real-world and simulated users, scenarios, environments, behaviors, and the interaction of these elements.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.10157/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: An illustration of SocioVerse framework invovling 4 powerful parts. The social environment provides an updated context for the simulation. During the simulation, the behavior engine takes the simulation setting, user profiles, and social information from the scenario engine, user engine, and social environment, respectively, and generates the results according to the query.", "description": "The SocioVerse framework consists of four key components: the Social Environment, the User Engine, the Scenario Engine, and the Behavior Engine.  The Social Environment module provides real-time updates from various sources (e.g., news, social media) to keep the simulation context current. The User Engine creates simulated users based on a large pool of 10 million real-world user profiles. The Scenario Engine designs and manages different simulation settings (questionnaires, interviews, social media interactions) to capture diverse scenarios. The Behavior Engine leverages LLMs to generate user behaviors according to the situation, user characteristics, and the broader social environment. A query is submitted to the system, which then uses all four components to generate realistic simulation results.", "section": "2 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.10157/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Illustration of three scenarios representing (a) presidential election prediction, (b) breaking news feedback, and (c) national economic survey.", "description": "Figure 3 illustrates three distinct applications of the SocioVerse framework across diverse domains. Panel (a) depicts a presidential election prediction, focusing on how SocioVerse simulates voter behavior and predicts election outcomes based on various demographic, geographic, and socio-political factors.  Panel (b) shows the breaking news feedback analysis, where SocioVerse models the public's reactions and opinions towards a significant news event (like the release of ChatGPT) using agents with diverse profiles and exposure to different information sources. The simulation then assesses the accuracy of public sentiment prediction. Finally, panel (c) illustrates the national economic survey, demonstrating SocioVerse's ability to simulate economic patterns and behaviors at a national scale, allowing for economic forecasting and analysis based on income and expenditure data from the surveyed population.", "section": "Implementation of Specific Scenarios"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.10157/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 4: An illustration of the performances of the breaking news feedback simulation, where PC, PR, PB, TR, FA, and PA denote six dimensions from the Likert scale (see\u00a0\u00a73.2 questionnaire design), with 1-point standing for totally disagree and 5-point for totally agree.", "description": "Figure 4 presents a comparison of simulated user responses against real-world responses to a survey on public opinion regarding the release of ChatGPT.

Each dimension is measured using a Likert scale ranging from 1 (totally disagree) to 5 (totally agree). The figure allows for a direct visual comparison of the simulated results and the ground truth data for each model, highlighting areas of agreement and disagreement.

The visualization likely uses bar charts or stacked bar charts to show the proportion of users within each demographic category (e.g., age, gender, income level) for both platforms. This comparison is valuable for understanding the differences in user characteristics across the two social media platforms and the implications of using these data for social simulation research.  The varying proportions within demographic categories highlight the diversity within each platform's user base and underscore the need for the SocioVerse framework's ability to handle and represent this diversity when generating social simulations.", "section": "2.2 User Engine"}]
