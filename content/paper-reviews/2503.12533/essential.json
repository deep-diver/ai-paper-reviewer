This is due to compounding errors in long-horizon tasks and varied module latencies. To resolve this, the authors introduce Being-0, a hierarchical agent framework that integrates an FM with a modular skill library. \n\nBeing-0 utilizes a novel Connector module, powered by a lightweight vision-language model (VLM), to bridge the gap between the FM's language-based plans and the execution of low-level skills. **This enhances embodied decision-making** and effectively coordinates locomotion and manipulation. With most components deployable on low-cost onboard devices, Being-0 achieves efficient, real-time performance on a full-sized humanoid robot.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2503.12533/podcast.wav"}
