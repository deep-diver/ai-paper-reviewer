It starts with selecting two specialized LLMs: Typhoon2 70B (a Thai language model) and DeepSeek R1 70B (a reasoning model).  These models undergo representation alignment using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with a curated dataset.  Finally, an Ability-Aware Model Merging technique combines the fine-tuned Typhoon2 and DeepSeek R1 models, resulting in the final Typhoon2 R1 70B model. The diagram visually depicts the data used at each step and the resulting model.", "section": "2 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.09056/extracted/6200631/figures/deepseek-r1-codeswitch.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Example demonstrate code-switching / language accuracy problem in DeepSeek R1 70B Distill. - The question is \u201dWhich came first, the chicken or the egg?\u201d - The model generated a final response, but it was unsatisfactory as it contained unnatural code-switching that not in Thai.", "description": "Figure 2 shows an example of the code-switching and language accuracy issues that can arise when using language models like DeepSeek R1 70B Distill, especially in low-resource languages.
