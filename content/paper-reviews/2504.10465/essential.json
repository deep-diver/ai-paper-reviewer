{"importance": "This paper introduces **a simpler and more efficient architecture for pixel-level understanding**, enabling new research directions and applications in vision-language models by addressing the complex architectures, extra components such as CLIP, segmentation experts, leading to high system complexity and limiting model scaling, and mixed referring tasks.", "summary": "Pixel-SAIL: A single transformer for pixel-grounded understanding!", "takeaways": ["Pixel-SAIL: Introduces a simplified MLLM architecture that reduces reliance on extra components.", "PerBench: A new benchmark is proposed for evaluating pixel-wise understanding, including tasks like detailed object description and visual prompt-based question answering.", "The proposed model shows that single transformer can still achieve better results."], "tldr": "Current Multimodal Large Language Models(MLLMs) have achieved remarkable performance for pixel-level understanding tasks. However, all the works rely heavily on extra components, such as vision encoder(CLIP), segmentation experts, which leads to high system complexity and limits model scaling. Therefore, there is a growing interest to enable broader applications, facilitating precise region-level editing and generation and achieving precise understanding of designated mask regions. \n\nTo address this, Pixel-SAIL is proposed: a single transformer for pixel-wise MLLM tasks. In particular, the paper presents three technical improvements on the plain baseline: a learnable upsampling module, visual prompt injection strategy, and vision expert distillation strategy. Furthermore, the paper collects a comprehensive pixel understanding benchmark (PerBench). The code and model will be released to the research community.", "affiliation": "Bytedance Seed", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.10465/podcast.wav"}
