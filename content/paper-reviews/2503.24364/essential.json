{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers because it introduces a **cost-effective method for improving SQL generation accuracy**. By leveraging execution results, the approach allows smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger models at a fraction of the computational cost. This opens new avenues for **developing more efficient and scalable SQL generation systems**, particularly relevant in resource-constrained environments.", "summary": "Execution-guided SQL generation enhances accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks by using execution results to select the most semantically consistent query, improving performance and reducing inference costs.", "takeaways": ["Execution-guided self-consistency significantly improves accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks.", "Smaller, cost-effective models can match the performance of much larger models using this approach.", "Partial execution and a 'patience' parameter further enhance accuracy and efficiency."], "tldr": "Large language models often struggle with one-shot accuracy in text-to-SQL tasks. Existing methods, like self-consistency, fall short when dealing with structurally diverse yet semantically equivalent queries. This limitation motivates exploring methods that measure equivalence at the execution level rather than relying on structural comparison, substantially narrowing the gap between pass@1 and pass@k accuracy.\n\nTo address this, the paper proposes a novel self-consistency approach tailored to SQL generation. By leveraging exact and approximate execution-based similarity metrics, the method assesses semantic equivalence directly from query outputs. This approach enables smaller models to match the performance of larger models at a fraction of the computational cost. The method integrates with existing models, offering a pathway to state-of-the-art SQL generation, improving the accuracy and efficiency of text-to-SQL tasks.", "affiliation": "Snowflake AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.24364/podcast.wav"}
