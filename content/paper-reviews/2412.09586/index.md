### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Gaze target estimation, predicting where a person is looking, traditionally involves complex multi-branch models combining features from scene, head, and auxiliary sources.  This complexity leads to challenges in training and scalability.  Prior work often faces limitations due to reliance on small-scale datasets and computationally expensive architectures.  The task is of significant interest, with applications in social interaction analysis and human-computer interaction.

This paper introduces Gaze-LLE, a novel method that significantly simplifies this task.  **It leverages a pretrained DINOv2 encoder**, a powerful general-purpose feature extractor, extracting a single scene representation.  A person-specific positional prompt is added for the head, processed via a lightweight transformer module, and decoded for gaze prediction.  **Gaze-LLE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters and faster training times**, demonstrating the potential of foundation models in simplifying and improving gaze estimation. This breakthrough opens doors to more efficient and scalable systems for various applications requiring gaze analysis.

> üîº Traditional gaze estimation methods use multiple encoders (head, scene, and auxiliary encoders for depth and pose) to combine features and predict gaze targets.  This figure contrasts these complex, multi-branch approaches with the proposed Gaze-LLE method.  Gaze-LLE simplifies the process by using a single, frozen (pre-trained and not further updated during training) image encoder. It extracts a scene-wide feature representation and adds a person-specific positional prompt to directly decode the gaze target, eliminating the need for feature fusion from multiple encoders.

### In-depth insights


#### Foundation Model Use
The paper explores the use of foundation models, specifically DINOv2, in gaze target estimation.  A **key insight** is that directly substituting DINOv2 into existing multi-branch architectures proves ineffective.  The authors highlight the **challenges** in naively applying these large models, attributing the poor performance to incompatibility between the pre-trained model and the specific task requirements.  Therefore, they introduce Gaze-LLE, a novel architecture featuring a specialized decoder which **adapts** DINOv2's features for accurate gaze prediction.  This approach leverages the power of pre-trained representations while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters, improving efficiency, and achieving state-of-the-art results.  The study emphasizes the **importance** of architectural design when integrating foundation models into existing systems and suggests that a simple substitution is insufficient; careful adaptation is crucial for optimal performance.

#### Head Prompting
The concept of 'Head Prompting' in the context of gaze estimation is a clever approach to leverage the power of large-scale learned encoders without the need for extensive, specialized training.  **Instead of relying on separate head and scene encoders**, which increases complexity and training time, head prompting injects person-specific information directly into a shared feature representation.  This injection, often in the form of a positional embedding derived from the head bounding box, acts as a conditional signal. The network effectively learns to associate this prompt with the visual features from the scene, **allowing it to focus its attention and refine the gaze prediction for that specific individual**. This approach significantly simplifies the architecture, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and improves efficiency while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. **A key design choice appears to be the timing and method of injecting the head prompt**, with the paper suggesting that injecting it after the scene encoder, as opposed to before, yields superior results. The method demonstrates the feasibility of using powerful, pretrained encoders while maintaining computational efficiency and generalizability.

#### Decoder Design
The decoder design is a critical aspect of the Gaze-LLE model, significantly impacting performance.  The authors opt for a streamlined design, eschewing the complex multi-branch architectures common in prior gaze estimation works.  **Instead of separate head and scene encoders**, Gaze-LLE utilizes a single feature representation extracted from a frozen DINOv2 encoder, a powerful general-purpose backbone. This simplification dramatically reduces the number of trainable parameters, improving efficiency.  The novelty lies in the introduction of **'head prompting'**, whereby a person-specific positional embedding is injected into the scene features, conditioning the decoder on the individual's head location without the need for a separate head branch.  This process leverages the backbone's existing powerful feature representations, adapting them for the gaze estimation task using a lightweight transformer module and subsequent convolutions to generate the final heatmap. **Extensive analysis validates this approach**, demonstrating that the late head integration and the transformer-based decoding method achieve superior performance compared to alternative strategies, showcasing the effectiveness and elegance of the chosen design.

#### Cross-dataset Results
The 'Cross-dataset Results' section would be crucial for evaluating the generalizability of the proposed Gaze-LLE model.  A strong model should demonstrate consistent performance across various datasets, indicating its ability to generalize beyond the training data.  **The results would reveal whether the model's gains are dataset-specific or represent a genuine advance in gaze estimation.**  Analyzing the performance metrics (AUC, L2 error) across different datasets will uncover if Gaze-LLE is robust to variations in image quality, scene complexity, and demographic characteristics.  A significant drop in performance on unseen datasets would suggest overfitting or limitations in model architecture. Conversely, **consistent high performance across diverse datasets would strongly support the claim that Gaze-LLE benefits from a powerful and generalizable foundation model.** The extent of performance degradation will highlight limitations and point to areas for future improvement, such as incorporating domain adaptation techniques.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this Gaze-LLE model could explore several promising avenues. **Extending the model to handle 3D gaze estimation** would enhance its practical utility, particularly in applications requiring depth perception.  **Investigating more sophisticated head pose handling** techniques beyond simple positional prompts, perhaps incorporating learned head pose embeddings or attention mechanisms, could further improve accuracy and robustness.  **Exploring alternative backbone architectures**, beyond DINOv2, such as those optimized for video or incorporating multimodal cues, might uncover further performance gains or enable adaptation to different data modalities.  Furthermore, **research into efficient inference methods** for deployment on resource-constrained devices (e.g., edge devices) is crucial to make this technology widely accessible. Finally, **benchmarking on more diverse and challenging datasets**, representing various conditions and demographics, is essential to rigorously assess the generalizability and limitations of the approach and to drive future advancements in gaze estimation.

> üîº Gaze-LLE is a novel gaze estimation framework. It uses a pre-trained DINOv2 model (frozen weights) as its backbone to extract visual features from an input RGB image.  These scene features are linearly projected to a lower dimension.  A learned head position embedding is then added to the scene features, specifically at the location of the person's head (obtained from a bounding box). This combined representation is then processed by three transformer layers.  An optional auxiliary task token is included in the input if the task requires in/out-of-frame gaze target prediction. Finally, a lightweight decoder module upsamples the processed features and predicts a heatmap representing the gaze target location, along with the in/out classification if applicable.

The center column shows the model's gaze predictions without head prompting.  In single-person scenes, the model generally predicts the gaze target correctly. However, when multiple people are present (as in the other two columns), the model struggles to accurately determine which person's gaze it should estimate, resulting in inaccurate predictions. This highlights the crucial role of head prompting in disambiguating gaze targets in multi-person contexts.

The figure uses three examples to illustrate the differences. The first two rows highlight cases where Tonini et al.'s algorithm incorrectly associates a gaze prediction with the wrong person due to the inclusion of ground truth gaze information in the matching process. The third row shows an example of overdetection where multiple gaze predictions are made for the same person, and the algorithm selects one based on heatmap similarity. The comparison demonstrates that the absence of ground truth gaze in the matching process makes it more difficult to select the best gaze prediction when multiple predictions are present, highlighting a limitation of the detection-based approach.

Tonini et al.‚Äôs matching algorithm selects the instance with the closest gaze prediction to the ground truth, but the bounding box prediction does not always correspond to the correct person (Rows 1-2). Additionally, we observe overdetection, where the algorithm predicts multiple instances for the same person with different gaze heatmaps (Row 3). Without the use of ground truth gaze information, the model cannot determine which of these instances is best.

First, a FoV (Field of View) map is generated using auxiliary modules: a 3D gaze angle estimator and a depth estimation model.  These provide context for gaze prediction.  Then, the FoV map, the estimated depth map, and the input image are combined and fed into a ResNet50-based encoder.  Features extracted by the encoder are processed by a convolutional decoder which ultimately outputs a gaze prediction. The researchers explored two experimental variations: one where the auxiliary modules are frozen (weights are not updated during training) and another where they are trained alongside the main model.

For each method, it shows the number of trainable parameters, the input data used (image (I), depth (D), pose (P), objects (O), and eyes (E)), and the performance metrics achieved: Area Under the Curve (AUC), Average L2 error, and Minimum L2 error.  AUC measures the accuracy of the heatmap produced by the model, while L2 error measures the distance between the predicted gaze target and the ground truth. The table highlights the relatively small number of parameters in the proposed Gaze-LLE model compared to existing methods.  Notes clarify that some parameter counts are estimates, one entry is based on a reimplementation of a prior model, and one metric was recalculated to match the methodology of a specific prior publication.

Specifically, they use bipartite matching with ground truth gaze at test time to assess performance.  This differs from Gaze-LLE and traditional approaches that do not utilize ground truth labels during testing.  To facilitate a fair comparison, the table shows results for Tonini et al.'s model using a modified matching cost (Equation 7) that excludes ground truth gaze, making the evaluation more comparable to Gaze-LLE's.

> üîº This table presents the ablation study on the number of transformer layers used in the gaze decoder. It shows how the performance (AUC, Avg L2, Min L2) changes as the number of layers increases from 1 to 5, while keeping other hyperparameters constant.  The results demonstrate the impact of the number of transformer layers on the model's accuracy and the trade-off between model complexity and performance.

> üîº This table presents an ablation study on the architecture of the Gaze-LLE model's gaze estimation module.  Specifically, it examines the impact of varying the internal dimension (dmodel) and the number of transformer layers on the model's performance.  The study uses a ViT-Base DINOv2 backbone and evaluates the results on the GazeFollow dataset.  The results show that increasing either the dimension or the number of layers yields diminishing returns in performance after a certain point.  Based on this analysis, the researchers selected a dmodel of 256 and 3 transformer layers as the optimal configuration for their default model.
