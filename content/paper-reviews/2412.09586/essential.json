This complexity leads to challenges in training and scalability.  Prior work often faces limitations due to reliance on small-scale datasets and computationally expensive architectures.  The task is of significant interest, with applications in social interaction analysis and human-computer interaction.\nThis paper introduces Gaze-LLE, a novel method that significantly simplifies this task.  **It leverages a pretrained DINOv2 encoder**, a powerful general-purpose feature extractor, extracting a single scene representation.  A person-specific positional prompt is added for the head, processed via a lightweight transformer module, and decoded for gaze prediction.  **Gaze-LLE achieves state-of-the-art performance with significantly fewer parameters and faster training times**, demonstrating the potential of foundation models in simplifying and improving gaze estimation. This breakthrough opens doors to more efficient and scalable systems for various applications requiring gaze analysis.", "affiliation": "Georgia Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2412.09586/podcast.wav"}
