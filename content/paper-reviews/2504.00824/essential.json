It opens new research directions in integrating retrieval and generation for specialized domains.", "summary": "ScholarCopilot: Accurate citations for academic writing with LLMs.", "takeaways": ["ScholarCopilot dynamically retrieves and integrates citations during text generation, improving accuracy and relevance.", "The model achieves state-of-the-art retrieval accuracy and surpasses larger models in generation quality on academic writing tasks.", "User studies confirm ScholarCopilot's effectiveness in citation recall, writing efficiency, and overall user experience."], "tldr": "Academic writing demands accurate citations, but existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fall short in this area. Traditional RAG systems use a **first-retrieve-then-generate pipeline**, which doesn't adapt to the evolving context of the writing. This leads to issues like misalignment of retrieval and generation models, inflexible retrieval decisions, and limited user control. \n\nThis paper introduces **ScholarCopilot, a new RAG framework designed for academic writing**. It dynamically determines when to retrieve citations by generating a special retrieval token during text generation. The retrieved references are then integrated into the text. The model is trained on a large dataset of arXiv papers and outperforms existing methods in retrieval accuracy and generation quality. User studies validate its effectiveness in improving citation accuracy and writing efficiency.", "affiliation": "University of Waterloo", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.00824/podcast.wav"}
