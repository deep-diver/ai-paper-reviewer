However, many models add complexity through specialized designs, making it unclear if these changes truly boost efficiency and performance. The paper tackles this issue by evaluating different DiT architectures, including variants like PixArt-style and MMDiT, and comparing them to a basic DiT that processes combined text and noise inputs to determine what designs yield parameter efficiency. \n\nThe paper introduces DiT-Air and DiT-Air-Lite, streamlined models that rival specialized models in performance. The streamlined architecture uses combined text/noise inputs and shared AdaLN parameters.  DiT-Air shrinks the model size by 66% compared to MMDiT. This research achieves state-of-the-art on GenEval and T2I CompBench. It also shows a new, state-of-the-art performance for image generation with a parameter-efficient design.", "affiliation": "Apple", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10618/podcast.wav"}
