The example problem, titled \"Missing Number\", presents a coding challenge that requires finding a missing number in an arithmetic progression within an integer array.  The problem statement is clearly outlined, along with illustrative examples and constraints. The provided starter code in Python offers a template to begin solving the problem. This figure highlights the type of problem and level of detail that is contained within the LeetCodeDataset.", "section": "2 LeetCodeDataset"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.14655/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Topic frequency distribution.", "description": "This bar chart visualizes the frequency distribution of various topic tags associated with the LeetCode problems in the LeetCodeDataset.  The x-axis lists the different topic tags (e.g., 'Array', 'String', 'Dynamic Programming'), and the y-axis represents the number of problems associated with each tag.  The chart allows for a quick understanding of which topics are most prevalent in the dataset, providing insights into the types of coding problems that are most commonly represented.", "section": "2.2 Dataset Overview"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.14655/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Monthly pass rates of various models on the LeetCodeDataset.", "description": "This figure shows the monthly pass rate of several code generation models on the LeetCodeDataset test set. The x-axis represents the LeetCode problem release month, and the y-axis represents the pass rate (percentage of problems solved correctly).  The figure displays trends in model performance over time, allowing for analysis of temporal effects and potential overfitting.  Different colored lines represent different models, enabling direct comparison of their performance across time.", "section": "3 Holistic Evaluation"}]
