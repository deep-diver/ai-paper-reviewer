{"importance": "This paper introduces **SynCoS**, a novel tuning-free framework, that enhances the quality of generated videos. This is particularly valuable as it offers a practical solution for overcoming the constraints of existing T2V models. The work contributes to enhanced content generation and consistency with less manual tuning.", "summary": "SynCoS: Synchronized sampling generates high-quality & coherent long videos from text, without extra training!", "takeaways": ["SynCoS, a new inference framework for multi-event long video generation, extends T2V diffusion models without additional training.", "Synchronization of complementary sampling methods ensures smooth local transitions and global coherence.", "Structured prompts improve the coherence of dynamic, semantically consistent multi-event generation."], "tldr": "Text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models can generate high-quality short videos, but producing real-world long videos remains a challenge due to limited data and high costs. Existing tuning-free methods use multiple prompts for dynamic content changes, but struggle with content drift and semantic coherence. Thus, the paper aims to solve the issues of maintaining a global structure and addressing error accumulation, which existing methods suffer from.\n\nTo address these issues, the paper introduces Synchronized Coupled Sampling (**SynCoS**), a tuning-free inference framework that synchronizes denoising paths across the entire video. SynCoS combines reverse and optimization-based sampling to ensure seamless local transitions and global coherence. Key innovations include a grounded timestep, fixed baseline noise, and structured prompts. This approach leads to smoother transitions, superior long-range coherence, and improved performance.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.08605/podcast.wav"}
