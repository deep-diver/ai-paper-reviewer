Existing benchmarks often oversimplify the problem, using artificial or single-step logic tasks. This limits our understanding of how well LLMs perform in situations that require complex reasoning and understanding of multifaceted, nuanced rules, creating potentially significant risks in real-world deployment. \nTo address this issue, the researchers introduce RULEARENA, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' proficiency in following complex rules grounded in real-world scenarios. RULEARENA includes tasks from three diverse domains\u2014airline baggage fees, NBA transactions, and tax regulations\u2014 each with a set of realistic rules. The benchmark assesses LLMs' ability to understand complex natural language instructions, perform logical reasoning, and execute accurate mathematical computations.  The findings reveal significant limitations in current LLMs, highlighting the challenges of advancing their rule-guided reasoning abilities.", "affiliation": "UC Santa Barbara", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.08972/podcast.wav"}
