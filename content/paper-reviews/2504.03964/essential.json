This paper addresses challenges in the biomedical and clinical domains, where specialized language and long-context documents are common. Existing models often struggle with the unique aspects of clinical text, such as medical terminology and the need to process lengthy patient narratives. These limitations hinder the effective application of NLP techniques in healthcare settings. \n\nTo tackle this, the authors introduce Clinical ModernBERT, a transformer-based encoder pretrained on large-scale biomedical literature, clinical notes, and medical ontologies. It captures both granular medical terminology and global discourse structure of clinical documentation. This model integrates architectural advancements of ModernBERT, such as rotary positional embeddings and flash attention, enhancing efficiency and long-context processing capabilities. The effectiveness of Clinical ModernBERT is demonstrated through empirical evaluations on various clinical NLP benchmarks, showcasing its competitive performance in semantic retrieval, classification, and entity recognition.", "affiliation": "UCLA", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03964/podcast.wav"}
