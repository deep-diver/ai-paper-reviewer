Existing open-source LLMs often underperform compared to their commercial counterparts, hindering research reproducibility and progress.  This paper addresses this gap by focusing on efficient LLM training, a critical area that is often lacking in detail from industry reports. \nThe researchers introduce YuLan-Mini, a 2.42B parameter LLM that exhibits state-of-the-art performance at its size.  **YuLan-Mini's success stems from three key technical advancements**: a well-designed data pipeline that incorporates data cleaning and scheduling strategies; a robust optimization method to mitigate training instability; and an effective annealing approach that utilizes targeted data selection and long context training.  The authors also **publicly release the full data composition and training details**, significantly contributing to the LLM research community by facilitating reproducibility and promoting open science.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2412.17743/podcast.wav"}
