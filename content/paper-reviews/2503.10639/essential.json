It offers a novel framework and a large-scale dataset that can significantly impact future research in multimodal AI and visual content generation.", "summary": "GoT: Reasoning guides vivid image generation and editing!", "takeaways": ["Introduces Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a new paradigm for visual generation and editing.", "Formulates semantic-spatial reasoning chains and creates large-scale GoT datasets.", "Develops a unified framework integrating MLLMs and diffusion models with a Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module."], "tldr": "Current image generation methods often lack explicit reasoning, struggling with complex scenes. The paper addresses this by introducing Generation Chain-of-Thought (GoT), a novel paradigm that enables generation and editing through an explicit language reasoning process. This approach transforms conventional text-to-image methods into a reasoning-guided framework that analyzes semantic relationships and spatial arrangements to enhance outputs. \n\nThe authors define the formulation of GoT and construct large-scale GoT datasets with detailed reasoning chains capturing semantic-spatial relationships. To leverage GoT, they implement a unified framework that integrates a reasoning chain generation with an end-to-end diffusion model enhanced by a novel Semantic-Spatial Guidance Module. Experiments show the framework achieves excellent performance on both generation and editing tasks.", "affiliation": "CUHK MMLab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10639/podcast.wav"}
