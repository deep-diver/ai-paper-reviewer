Existing approaches often rely on limited datasets and face challenges in processing complex 3D data.  They also struggle with creating high-fidelity models aligned with input images and often suffer from artifacts.\nThis paper introduces TripoSG, a novel framework addressing these challenges. It uses a large-scale rectified flow transformer trained on a meticulously curated dataset of 2 million high-quality 3D samples. The approach uses a hybrid training strategy that combines SDF (Signed Distance Function), surface normal, and eikonal loss for high-fidelity 3D mesh generation. The system also incorporates a sophisticated data processing pipeline to ensure high-quality training data.  Results demonstrate TripoSG achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape synthesis.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06608/podcast.wav"}
