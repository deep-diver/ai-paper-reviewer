Traditional methods rely on manual verification and rule-based matching, which have low accuracy and struggle to adapt to evolving strategies. Recent advancements in LLMs offer new solutions, but current methods exhibit a significant modality gap and performance variations. This shows the importance of having a comprehensive multimodal telecom fraud dataset. \n\nTo address these issues, the authors present **TeleAntiFraud-28k**, the first open-source audio-text slow-thinking dataset for automated telecom fraud analysis. The dataset is constructed through privacy-preserved text-truth sample generation, semantic enhancement via LLM-based self-instruction sampling, and multi-agent adversarial synthesis. The authors construct **TeleAntiFraud-Bench**, a standardized evaluation benchmark, and contribute a production-optimized SFT model trained on hybrid real/synthetic data, open-sourcing the data processing framework for community-driven dataset expansion.", "affiliation": "China Mobile Internet Company Ltd.", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "2503.24115/podcast.wav"}
