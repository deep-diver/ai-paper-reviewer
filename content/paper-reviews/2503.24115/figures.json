We create the TeleAntiFraud-28k dataset through three strategies: Real-Data ASR Processing, LLM-Based Imitation adn Augmention, and multi-agent adversarial synthesis. We also construct TeleAntiFraud-Bench for model evaluation and contribute a supervised fine-tuning model with an open-sourced data processing framework.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of the TeleAntiFraud-30k system, designed to tackle the challenges in telecom fraud detection.  It highlights the three key strategies used to build the TeleAntiFraud-28k dataset: 1) Real-Data ASR Processing, which involves transcribing real audio data while preserving privacy, 2) LLM-Based Imitation and Augmentation which uses large language models to generate synthetic data that augments the real data,  and 3) Multi-agent Adversarial Synthesis, which simulates realistic and diverse fraud scenarios. The system also includes TeleAntiFraud-Bench, a standardized benchmark for evaluating model performance, and a fine-tuned, open-source model for supervised learning.", "section": "3 Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.24115/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2. Data Flow of Audio Data Generation", "description": "This figure illustrates the process of generating audio data for the TeleAntiFraud-28k dataset.  It begins with JSON data representing various conversation scenarios, which is then processed through an audio synthesis module to create realistic-sounding audio.  A large language model (LALM), denoted as 'deepseek', plays a role in this generation process, likely contributing to the realism or complexity of the synthesized audio. The result is the final generated audio data which is used for the dataset.", "section": "3.1 Audio Data Generation Pipeline"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.24115/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3. Architecture Diagram of the Multi-Agent Adversarial Framework", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of a multi-agent adversarial framework used to generate diverse and realistic conversations for a telecom fraud detection dataset.  Three agents interact: a user, a fraudster (cheater), and a manager.  The user and cheater agents use large language models (LLMs) to generate their dialogue turns. The manager agent oversees the conversation to ensure it aligns with defined fraud scenarios and ensures a natural flow.  This framework enables the creation of realistic and diverse conversations simulating various fraud tactics, enriching the training data for fraud detection models.", "section": "3.1.3 Multi-Agent Adversarial Framework"}]
