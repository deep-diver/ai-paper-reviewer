### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) can be enhanced by adding external knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and long-context models are methods for achieving that. However, RAG may miss key information, and long-context models are computationally expensive. Thus, there are limitations that restrict the effectiveness of LLMs.



To address the problem, this paper proposes task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression, which compresses external knowledge in a zero- or few-shot setup. This allows LLMs to reason effectively with compressed information, outperforming RAG and task-agnostic compression methods. The method improves accuracy while reducing inference latency.

> üîº Figure 1 presents a comparison of different knowledge integration methods for LLMs on a synthetic dataset.  The methods compared include Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and several key-value (KV) cache compression techniques, both with and without few-shot examples. The x-axis represents the retrieval context length (in tokens), showing how much of the 32,000 token corpus was used. The y-axis displays the overall accuracy score. The figure demonstrates that the few-shot KV compression approach outperforms RAG, especially when the context length is significantly smaller than the full corpus size. This suggests that for tasks requiring comprehensive knowledge reasoning, compression methods are more effective than retrieval-based methods, particularly when the evidence is broadly distributed across the knowledge base, rather than concentrated in a few retrievable chunks.

### In-depth insights


#### Task-Aware Comp
**Task-aware compression** represents a strategic approach to condense information, specifically tailoring the compression process to the demands of a given task. Unlike generic compression methods, task-aware techniques leverage knowledge about the task's objectives, constraints, and typical data patterns. This allows them to prioritize the preservation of information most relevant to the task, potentially sacrificing less important data to achieve higher compression ratios. Such methods are useful for optimizing performance in scenarios where computational resources are limited, or data transmission costs are high, while still maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy or utility for the target task. The design and implementation of effective **task-aware compression** algorithms require a deep understanding of both the compression domain and the specific requirements of the application.

#### RAG vs. KV Cache
**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** fetches evidence, but info may fall outside top ranks. It excels with focused queries, needing few evidence pieces. **KV cache compression** compacts all relevant info, enabling reasoning over it efficiently. It is effective for broad queries demanding synthesis, outperforming **RAG**. Task-aware methods compress in zero/few-shot setups, reasoning efficiently over compacted representations. **KV cache** reduces memory load, compressing matrices while preserving essential information. RAG‚Äôs retrieval relies on similarity search, missing implicit relationships and introducing noise. **KV cache compression** mitigates memory load, retaining essential info. The paper introduces task-aware compression, balancing efficiency and relevance for superior results, with performance surpassing query-agnostic compression and approaching query-aware compression.

#### Long Context LLMs
**Long context LLMs** face significant challenges in effectively utilizing extended input sequences. While increasing the context window allows processing more information, models often struggle to identify and synthesize relevant pieces from the entire context. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a solution by fetching external knowledge, but its effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the retrieval mechanism. The paper introduces task-aware KV cache compression as an alternative, aiming to condense relevant information into a compact representation. This approach can potentially outperform RAG in scenarios requiring the synthesis of information from multiple sources, addressing a key limitation of existing methods. The method boosts perforce especially in multifaceted or broad queries.

#### Synthetic Dataset
The paper introduces a custom **synthetic dataset** designed for controlled experiments in question answering (QA). This dataset allows for precise manipulation of interconnectivity between text chunks, enabling thorough evaluation of KV-cache compression and retrieval methods. It uses two query types: **direct retrieval** (localized information) and **join-like** (requiring synthesis across chunks). The synthetic datasets will give researchers full control over the complexity level of the dataset by varying inter-chunk connectivity which facilitates the identification of optimal scenarios for each technique by adjusting the connectivity levels. Using synthetic data and query types offer a robust framework for evaluating knowledge reasoning capabilities. This dataset is expected to be publicly released to support future research.

#### Multi-Hop Fails
**RAG's reliance on similarity-based retrieval limits its ability to effectively synthesize information from multiple, disparate sources**, resulting in significant performance degradation when answering questions that require integrating information from multiple chunks. In high-connectivity scenarios, the performance gap widens further, as relevant information is scattered across numerous chunks. Additionally, RAG struggles with entity disambiguation, particularly when dealing with similar entity names. **Embedding-based retrieval often misidentifies relevant passages**, retrieving irrelevant chunks due to embedding proximity, hindering accurate reasoning. These limitations highlight the need for alternative approaches that can effectively handle multi-hop reasoning and entity disambiguation in long-context scenarios. The authors' proposed approach addresses these challenges by precomputing a unified, task-aware compressed cache, enabling more robust coverage of multi-hop or broad queries compared to RAG's similarity-based lookups. **The key insight is that the model can better prioritize critical information through explicit query cues during compression**, improving accuracy and reducing the need for extensive retrieval during inference.

> üîº This figure illustrates the task-aware key-value (KV) cache compression technique.  It starts with a large KV cache (128k tokens) containing the original context (C) for a given task. This context is then compressed to a much smaller size (16k tokens) using task instructions (T) and a few-shot examples (FS).  The compression process focuses on retaining only the essential information needed to answer factual questions related to the task. The resulting compressed cache can then be used by a large language model (LLM) at inference time to answer multiple questions efficiently, as if it had access to the entire, uncompressed original context.

> üîº This figure displays the model's attention mechanism, visualized by the cross-attention scores between the prompt and the context tokens, under four different prompting conditions:  (a) only the last token as prompt, (b) a task description as prompt, (c) a task description plus few-shot examples, and (d) a task description, few-shot examples, and a question.  The visualization shows how the attention focuses on increasingly relevant context tokens as more information is included in the prompt.  The perplexity values, representing the model's uncertainty in predicting the answer, are also shown, decreasing as the prompt becomes more informative, indicating improved ability to select relevant context tokens.

> üîº The figure illustrates the structure of a synthetic dataset designed for evaluating the performance of different methods in handling varying levels of complexity in long-context reasoning. The dataset is structured around three entity types: People, Projects, and Memberships. Each entity type is represented by multiple chunks of text, each with a standardized length of 256 tokens. The connectivity level parameter controls the relationships between these entities. In the depicted example, where the connectivity level is set to 2, each person is connected to exactly two projects. This creates different levels of complexity for queries, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of model performance on varying levels of knowledge synthesis and information retrieval.

> üîº This figure illustrates the two types of questions used in the synthetic dataset experiments: direct retrieval and join-like questions.  Direct retrieval questions can be answered using information from a single text chunk (e.g., 'Which projects does {pname1} belong to?'). Join-like questions require synthesizing information across multiple chunks (e.g., 'What are {pname1}'s project domains?'). The example shown has a connectivity level of 2, meaning each person is connected to exactly two projects. This level of connectivity increases dataset complexity, as information is distributed across more chunks, making it more challenging for models to answer.

Join-like questions necessitate synthesizing information from multiple parts of the dataset. The graph displays the performance of RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and different variants of KV cache compression (KVCompress FS, KVCompress FS+Q).  The x-axis represents connectivity level (1-8), indicating the level of interconnectivity between different information chunks.  The y-axis indicates the overall performance score (%). Different lines represent different target context lengths, showing how much information is given to the LLM. The dashed lines demonstrate the connectivity level where RAG starts to receive the necessary chunks for processing, highlighting the threshold beyond which RAG starts to underperform.  This figure showcases the strength of the KV compression approach over RAG when more intricate inter-connectivity is present in the dataset and limited context is available.
