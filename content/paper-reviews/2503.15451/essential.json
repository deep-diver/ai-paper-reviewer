{"importance": "This paper introduces a novel approach to streaming motion generation, enabling more realistic and responsive virtual characters. It has potential for real-time applications like games and robotics. The method of **continuous causal latent space** opens new avenues for research, potentially improving other generative tasks. It also provides benchmarks and downstream applications that can lead to further investigations.", "summary": "MotionStreamer: Streaming motion generation w/ diffusion-based autoregressive model in causal latent space.", "takeaways": ["Introduces MotionStreamer, a new framework for streaming motion generation using diffusion models and causal latent spaces.", "Presents a causal motion compressor that ensures online decoding and minimizes information loss.", "Demonstrates state-of-the-art performance and shows downstream applications like multi-round generation and dynamic motion composition."], "tldr": "Existing text-conditioned streaming motion generation methods struggle with online response and long-term error accumulation. Diffusion models are limited by pre-defined motion lengths. GPT-based methods suffer from delayed responses and non-causal tokenization hinders performance. Thus, there's a need for continuous, causally-aware models that can adapt to real-time text input while maintaining motion coherence and minimizing errors. \n\nTo address these issues, this paper presents **MotionStreamer**, a novel framework that uses a continuous causal latent space within a probabilistic autoregressive model. This mitigates information loss and reduces error accumulation. A causal motion compressor enables online decoding. Two new training strategies: Two-Forward training and Mixed training, address error accumulation and improve compositional learning. The method achieves SOTA performance and supports multi-round generation and dynamic motion composition.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Action Recognition"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15451/podcast.wav"}
