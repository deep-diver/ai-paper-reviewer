The reason why existing methods fail to generate high-quality 4D scenes is that when a 4D scene involves wide-range variations, the initialized foreground objects become so blurred that they seem to vanish completely, making it difficult to achieve high-quality 4D synthesis in subsequent generation processes.", "description": "This figure compares the initialization of a 4D scene using two different methods: an existing method (4DGS) and the authors' proposed method (Progress4D).  When dealing with wide-range movements of objects within a 4D scene, existing methods often produce blurred or poorly defined foreground objects in the initial 3D reconstruction. This makes it extremely difficult to generate a high-quality 4D reconstruction in later processing steps. In contrast, the new method's initialization shows clearer and more well-defined objects, even in scenes with significant movement.", "section": "4.
