{"importance": "This paper is important because it reveals that simply increasing the number of documents in RAG systems can hurt performance, even with a fixed context length. **This finding challenges the common assumption that more context is always better and highlights the need for new techniques to manage multiple documents effectively**. It opens new research avenues to minimize conflicts.", "summary": "More documents can hurt RAG performance, even with same length!", "takeaways": ["Increasing the number of retrieved documents in RAG systems can hurt performance, even when the total context length is kept constant.", "LLMs may struggle to process information effectively when it is spread across multiple documents, potentially due to conflicting or overlapping details.", "Future RAG systems should balance relevance and diversity in retrieved documents and manage conflicts."], "tldr": "Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) enhances LLMs with relevant documents, but previous work has shown that performance can degrade when retrieving many documents. However, it was unclear whether this degradation was due to the increased number of documents itself or the longer context length associated with more documents. To address this, the paper investigates how the number of retrieved documents affects LLM performance while controlling for context length using a multi-hop QA task. \n\nThe authors evaluate various language models on custom datasets derived from MuSiQue, keeping the context length and position of relevant information constant while varying the number of documents. **The results show that increasing the number of documents in RAG settings poses significant challenges for LLMs and that processing multiple documents is a separate challenge from handling long contexts**. The authors make their datasets and code available to facilitate further research in multi-document retrieval, and highlights the need for retrieval systems to balance relevance.", "affiliation": "School of Computer Science and Engineering", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2503.04388/podcast.wav"}
