{"importance": "This paper is important because it introduces **MinMo**, a novel multimodal large language model that achieves state-of-the-art results in seamless voice interaction.  Its **multi-stage training process** and **novel voice decoder** address key limitations of existing models, opening new avenues for research in full-duplex conversations and style-controllable speech synthesis. This work is highly relevant to the current research trends in multimodal LLMs and has the potential to significantly impact the development of more natural and human-like conversational AI systems.", "summary": "MinMo: 8B parameter multimodal LLM for seamless voice interaction, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks by using a multi-stage training process and a novel voice decoder.", "takeaways": ["MinMo achieves state-of-the-art performance in seamless voice interaction across various benchmarks.", "MinMo's multi-stage training effectively addresses limitations of prior multimodal models.", "MinMo's novel voice decoder outperforms existing models in voice generation."], "tldr": "Prior works on speech-text multimodal models for voice interaction are categorized into native and aligned models.  Native models face challenges like drastic discrepancy between speech and text sequence lengths and insufficient speech pre-training. Aligned models, while better at maintaining text LLM capabilities, usually suffer from small-scale speech data and lack systematic exploration of instruction following.  This paper introduces MinMo, a novel multimodal large language model that addresses these issues.\nMinMo uses a multi-stage training process involving speech-to-text, text-to-speech, speech-to-speech, and duplex interaction alignments on a massive 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data.  It also introduces a novel voice decoder improving voice generation.  The results show MinMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation while maintaining text LLM capabilities and facilitating full-duplex conversations.", "affiliation": "Alibaba Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.06282/podcast.wav"}
