### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Cross-modality generation is key, but current methods treat text as conditional and require complex mechanisms. Can we unify understanding and generation by enabling direct transitions in a shared space? This work revisits flow matching, learning a direct path enabling faster multimodal generation. Unlike diffusions, it requires source and target sharing the same shape.



This paper introduces **FlowTok**, flowing tokens for text and images. It encodes images into compact 1D tokens, reducing latent space by 3.3x at 256 resolution, removing complex conditioning. It extends to image-to-text under the same formulation. It is memory-efficient, needs fewer resources, faster sampling, and comparable SOTA performance. The code will be released!

### In-depth insights


#### Direct Flow Gen
**Direct Flow Generation** represents a significant shift in generative modeling, **moving away from conditional approaches** to **directly transforming source data** into the target modality. Instead of guiding the generation process through conditioning signals, direct flow methods learn a direct mapping, potentially leading to **more efficient and controlled generation**. This approach is particularly interesting in **cross-modal tasks** like text-to-image generation, where aligning the source and target representations is critical. The success hinges on finding a **shared latent space** and effective mechanisms for direct transformation, while retaining fidelity. Direct flow approaches provide **faster inference** than iterative methods because they only require a single pass through a transformation network. However, the training is more complex and needs a well-defined loss function for the transformation network.

#### 1D Tokenization
**1D tokenization** represents a departure from traditional 2D grid-based approaches in image representation, aiming for a more compact and efficient latent space. The core idea revolves around eliminating the need to preserve the spatial structure inherent in images, which is crucial for generative tasks. By encoding images into a 1D sequence of tokens, **computational costs can be reduced**, as there is no need to process the spatial information using operations. The **challenge** lies in effectively capturing the image's content and semantic information within the reduced dimensionality of the 1D token sequence. Successfully implementing 1D tokenization is essential for enabling efficient flow matching, where different modalities (text and image) are projected into a shared latent space, thereby facilitating seamless cross-modal generation. Furthermore, this approach **aligns well with the sequential nature of text**, which is also encoded as a 1D sequence of tokens, enabling direct and efficient interactions between text and image representations.

#### FlowTok Design
While "FlowTok Design" isn't explicitly a heading, the paper centers around **direct flow matching between text and images** by projecting them into a shared 1D latent space.  This involves carefully engineering both text and image encoders.  The text encoder, often a pre-trained model like CLIP, is paired with a **text projector** to map embeddings to a lower-dimensional space matching the image tokens.  On the image side, the paper enhances the TA-TiTok tokenizer with techniques like RoPE and SwiGLU FFN to create **compact 1D image tokens**.  The design emphasizes streamlining the architecture, eliminating complex conditioning mechanisms found in diffusion models. A critical aspect is aligning the number of text and image tokens. The compact 1D token representation, smaller than typical 2D latent spaces, is key to the model's efficiency, leading to faster training and inference. By directly flowing between these representations, FlowTok simplifies cross-modal generation.

#### Fast Convergence
While the paper doesn't explicitly use the heading "Fast Convergence", the concept is central to its claims. FlowTok achieves **comparable performance** to state-of-the-art text-to-image models, but with **significantly reduced training time**. This "fast convergence" is a direct result of FlowTok's architectural choices: the **unified, compact 1D latent space** simplifies the learning task, reducing the complexity of the mapping function the model needs to learn. By directly evolving text and image modalities within this shared space, FlowTok eliminates the need for intricate conditioning mechanisms and noise scheduling that typically slow down diffusion-based models. The efficient training allows FlowTok to be trained with **fewer computational resources**, making the research more accessible. Also, due to 1D architecture it achieves much **faster sampling speed**.

#### Beyond Text->Img
The exploration 'Beyond Text->Img' suggests a move past traditional text-to-image generation, hinting at a more holistic approach to cross-modal understanding. This could involve scenarios where images influence text generation ('Img->Text'), or even a synergistic, iterative process. The authors might explore the challenges of establishing a bi-directional flow between modalities, moving beyond text as a mere conditioning signal. Novel architectures and training strategies could be introduced to effectively capture and translate the underlying information in each modality. A potential focus could be on achieving more contextually aware and nuanced image generation, where the output reflects a deeper comprehension of the input text, or vice-versa. Furthermore, the investigation could extend to multi-modal editing, manipulation, and creative exploration, enabling users to seamlessly blend text and imagery for artistic expression. Ultimately, the exploration aims to foster a more unified and interactive relationship between textual and visual information, broadening the possibilities of creative content creation and data understanding.

> 🔼 Figure 4 provides a detailed overview of the FlowTok framework.  The top half illustrates the text-to-image generation process.  Input text is first encoded into a high-dimensional vector representation (Tinit) using a CLIP text encoder. This vector is then projected into a lower-dimensional latent space, creating text tokens (ZT).  These text tokens are transformed into image tokens (ZI) of the same dimensions via a flow matching process. Finally, a 1D Image VAE Decoder uses the image tokens to generate the final image. The bottom half demonstrates image-to-text generation.  An input image is encoded into image tokens (ZI) by a 1D Image VAE Encoder. Through flow matching, these tokens are mapped to text tokens (ZT) which are then decoded by a text decoder to produce the final text.  The figure highlights FlowTok's efficiency compared to traditional methods, achieving a 3.3x compression rate by using a direct 1D transformation of both text and images, leading to reduced memory usage, faster training, and quicker inference.

> 🔼 Table 2 presents a comparison of FlowTok's performance in zero-shot text-to-image generation against other state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets: COCO and MJHQ-30K.  The models are grouped into two categories based on their approach: those using text as conditions to guide image generation, and those directly learning the alignment between text and image distributions.  The table also indicates whether models were trained solely on publicly available data ('open-data'), the training cost in terms of 8 A100 GPU-days ('T'), and inference speed (images per second) at 256px resolution using a single A100 GPU ('I').  These metrics offer a comprehensive evaluation of both performance and efficiency.

> Table 2:  Zero-Shot Text-to-Image Generation Results on COCO and MJHQ-30K. We compare FlowTok with state-of-the-art methods, categorized into two approaches: (1) text as conditions, where text tokens are used as conditions to guide the generation process, and (2) text as source distributions, where the model directly learns the alignment between text and image distributions. “open-data”: Models are trained exclusively with publicly available datasets. “T”: Model training cost, measured in 8 A100 days using float16 precision. “I”: Model inference throughput, measured at 256px resolution in samples per second on a single A100 with batch size 64 using float16 precision.

> 🔼 This table presents ablation studies on the text alignment loss function used in FlowTok, a text-to-image generation model. Three key aspects of the loss function are investigated: the alignment target, the choice of loss function (cosine similarity vs. contrastive loss), and the loss weight. The goal is to determine the optimal configuration for preserving semantic information and improving generation quality.  The results are evaluated using the FID-30K metric on the COCO dataset with the FlowTok-B model, without classifier-free guidance (CFG).

> 🔼 Table 5 details the datasets used to train the FlowTok model, specifically focusing on the filtering criteria applied to each dataset.  These criteria include image resolution (aspect ratio less than 2 and the longer side of the image at least 256 pixels), aesthetic quality (images with predicted aesthetic scores above a certain threshold, specified in parentheses for each dataset), and the presence of watermarks (images with a predicted watermark probability above 0.5 were removed). The table notes that a re-captioned version of LAION-pop, provided by MaskGen [41], was used, incorporating improved captions.
