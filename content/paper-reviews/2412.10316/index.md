### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current image editing methods using diffusion models struggle with large modifications, complex instructions, and interactive control. Inversion-based methods are computationally expensive and limited in editability, while instruction-based methods lack interactivity and often rely on noisy datasets. Existing inpainting methods have limitations in preserving unmasked regions and generalizing to different mask types. These challenges hinder the development of versatile and user-friendly image editing tools.

BrushEdit introduces an innovative framework that combines multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with a novel dual-branch inpainting model to address these limitations. It allows users to edit images by simply providing text instructions and interacting with free-form masks.  The MLLM interprets instructions, identifies target objects, and generates captions for the edited image. The dual-branch inpainting model, trained on a unified dataset, then seamlessly fills the masked regions while preserving the background. This agent-based cooperative approach enables multi-turn interactive editing with flexible control over mask shapes and editing intensity, significantly enhancing image editing quality and user experience.

> üîº BrushEdit allows users to input their own masks, which often combine the detailed structure of segmentation masks with the noise of random masks. Unlike previous methods that require separate models for different mask types (e.g., BrushNet-Ran for random masks and BrushNet-Seg for segmentation masks), BrushEdit uses a single, unified model, resulting in more natural and coherent edits.  This figure shows four examples of user-provided masks and how BrushEdit uses them to generate realistic and artifact-free inpainting results.

> Figure 1: BrushEdit¬†can achieve all-in-one inpainting for arbitrary mask shapes without requiring separate model training for each mask type. This flexibility in handling arbitrary shapes also enhances user-driven editing, as user-provided masks often combine segmentation-based structural details with random mask noise. By supporting arbitrary mask shapes, BrushEdit¬†avoids the artifacts introduced by the random-mask version of BrushNet-Ran and the edge inconsistencies caused by the segmentation-mask version BrushNet-Seg‚Äôs strong reliance on boundary shapes.

### In-depth insights


#### Inpainting & Edit
**BrushEdit**, an innovative framework, tackles limitations of current image editing by unifying inpainting and instruction-guided editing.  It leverages the power of **MLLMs for instruction comprehension** and a **dual-branch inpainting model (BrushNet)** for seamless edits. This approach allows versatile modifications like object addition/removal and structural changes using free-form masks, overcoming the restrictions of inversion-based methods and the rigidity of instruction-based approaches.  BrushEdit excels in **preserving background fidelity** and **aligning with editing instructions**, offering a user-friendly, interactive editing experience.

#### BrushEdit Paradigm
**BrushEdit introduces a novel paradigm for interactive image editing**, integrating inpainting and language models.  It allows users to provide **free-form text instructions and masks**, streamlining complex edits. Unlike inversion-based methods, **BrushEdit maintains high background fidelity** while enabling significant structural changes.  This is achieved by **a dual-branch inpainting model**, where one branch focuses on background preservation and the other generates the edited region based on instructions.  The integration with MLLMs allows for **semantic understanding of user intent**, further improving edit quality. This paradigm also offers **flexible control**, enabling seamless integration with diverse pre-trained diffusion models and adjustment of background preservation levels, making it **versatile and user-friendly**.

#### MLLM Integration
**Integrating Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transformative for image editing**.  BrushEdit leverages MLLMs to interpret complex natural language instructions, enabling a seamless user experience.  This goes beyond keyword matching; the MLLM understands the nuances of language to identify editing types (addition, removal, style change), locate target objects, and generate detailed captions for the desired output.  **This deep understanding allows for free-form, interactive editing**, where users provide instructions like "Replace the cat with a bear" and the MLLM guides the editing process.  This intelligent interpretation is crucial for bridging the gap between user intent and image manipulation, enabling complex edits that go beyond the capabilities of traditional methods.

#### Versatile Control
**Versatile control** in image editing empowers users with fine-grained manipulation over image elements and attributes.  This control can manifest in various forms, from **precisely adjusting colors and textures** to **modifying object shapes and positions**.  Advanced techniques even allow for **content-aware modifications**, where edits seamlessly integrate into the existing image context.  This level of control is crucial for achieving **realistic and high-quality editing results**, enabling users to realize their creative visions effectively.  Beyond the technical capabilities, versatile control also enhances the **user experience**, fostering **intuitive and interactive editing workflows**.  This, in turn, promotes accessibility and empowers users of all skill levels to engage with image editing tools effectively.  The continuous development of more **sophisticated and intuitive control mechanisms** remains a key area of focus in the field of image editing, aiming to further bridge the gap between user intent and editing outcome.

#### Ethical Concerns
**Ethical considerations** are paramount in image editing research.  Potential misuse includes creating **deepfakes**, manipulating images for **disinformation**, and amplifying **harmful biases**.  While innovation drives progress, responsible development and usage are crucial.  Open discussions about ethical implications, **transparency** in model limitations, and the establishment of usage **guidelines** are essential to mitigate potential harm.  Furthermore,  **dataset bias** must be addressed to ensure fair representation and prevent perpetuation of stereotypes.  **Copyright infringement** is another concern, especially with models trained on copyrighted material.  Balancing creative freedom with ethical responsibility is an ongoing challenge.  **User education** plays a vital role in promoting ethical awareness and preventing malicious applications of these powerful tools.  Finally,  **accountability** mechanisms for misuse must be considered. Ongoing dialogue and collaboration among researchers, developers, and policymakers are crucial to navigate these complex issues.

> üîº BrushEdit's model architecture takes a mask and a masked image as input and outputs an inpainted image.  It involves downsampling the mask, encoding the masked image with VAE, concatenating noisy latent, masked image latent, and downsampled mask as BrushEdit input, adding extracted BrushEdit features to pre-trained UNet layers (using a zero convolution block), denoising, and blending the generated and masked images with a blurred mask.

> Figure 2: Model overview. Our model outputs an inpainted image given the mask and masked image input. Firstly, we downsample the mask to accommodate the size of the latent, and input the masked image to the VAE encoder to align the distribution of latent space. Then, noisy latent, masked image latent, and downsampled mask are concatenated as the input of BrushEdit. The feature extracted from BrushEdit¬†is added to pretrained UNet layer by layer after a zero convolution block[33]. After denoising, the generated image and masked image are blended with a blurred mask.

> üîº Figure 7 demonstrates how BrushEdit's control scale parameter, *w*, allows adjustment of the balance between preserving the original content of the unmasked regions and applying the edits specified in the text prompt. Subfigures (b) through (h) show the output images as *w* decreases from 1.0 to 0.2.  A larger *w* value prioritizes preserving the original image, leading to more subtle edits. Conversely, a smaller *w* value emphasizes the edits, potentially at the cost of altering more of the original content. This demonstrates that *w* acts as a slider for how strongly the edits are applied, giving users fine-grained control over the editing process.

> üîº This table presents a quantitative comparison of various image inpainting models using the EditBench dataset with random masks. The comparison includes Blended Latent Diffusion (BLD), Stable Diffusion Inpainting (SDI), HD-Painter (HDP), PowerPaint (PP), ControlNet-Inpainting (CNI), BrushNet-Ran, and the proposed method BrushEdit. The table evaluates the models based on background fidelity metrics (PSNR, MSE, LPIPS, SSIM) and text alignment using CLIP Similarity. The results demonstrate that BrushEdit significantly improves the preservation of masked regions, outperforming other methods, thanks to its novel dual-branch framework and combined mask training strategy.

> üîº This table presents an ablation study on BrushEdit's dual-branch vs. single-branch design for image inpainting. Stable Diffusion Inpainting (SDI) uses a single-branch design where the entire UNet is fine-tuned.  Two dual-branch models were evaluated: one with the base UNet fine-tuned and one with the base UNet frozen.  Results show superior performance with the dual-branch design, with freezing the base UNet providing the best balance of performance and model flexibility.

> TABLE VI: Ablation on dual-branch design. Stable Diffusion Inpainting (SDI) use single-branch design, where the entire UNet is fine-tuned. We conducted an ablation analysis by training a dual-branch model with two variations: one with the base UNet fine-tuned, and another with the base UNet forzened. Results demonstrate the superior performance achieved by adopting the dual-branch design. Red is the best result.

> üîº This table presents the ablation study results for different model architectures on image inpainting tasks. It investigates the impact of varying components such as the image encoder (using a randomly initialized convolutional layer or a VAE), mask inclusion, the presence of cross-attention layers, the method of UNet feature addition (full, half, or like ControlNet), and blending operation (none, direct pasting, or blurred blending).

> TABLE VII: Ablation on model architecture. We ablate on the following components: the image encoder (Enc), selected from a random initialized convolution (Conv) and a VAE; the inclusion of mask in input (Mask), chosen from adding (w/) and not adding (w/o); the presence of cross-attention layers (Attn), chosen from adding (w/) and not adding (w/o); the type of UNet feature addition (UNet), selected from adding the full UNet feature (full), adding half of the UNet feature (half), and adding the feature like ControlNet (CN); and finally, the blending operation (Blend), chosen from not adding (w/o), direct pasting (paste), and blurred blending (blur). Red is the best result.
