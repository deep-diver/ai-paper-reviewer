[{"heading_title": "Data Bottleneck", "details": {"summary": "**Data scarcity** is a significant hurdle in customized generation. Creating models that generate diverse poses and attributes requires comprehensive datasets, which are **difficult to acquire**. Multi-perspective subject variations are needed, but obtaining such real paired datasets is impractical. Existing methods use real images with **limited diversity**, or synthetic data of **lower quality** and domain coverage. Customized models often trade off between subject similarity and text controllability due to these data limitations. Addressing the data bottleneck is crucial for unlocking more controllable and scalable customized generation."}}, {"heading_title": "Model-Data CoEvo", "details": {"summary": "**Model-Data Co-evolution** presents a paradigm shift in AI, moving beyond static datasets and models. The central idea is that models should be trained from data to improve each other iteratively. **Less controllable models systematically generate customization data** used to further train more controllable variants to bridge the gap between the model and real world data. Thus there is a **persistent co-evolution** between the model and data."}}, {"heading_title": "Progressive S2I", "details": {"summary": "Progressive Subject-to-Image (S2I) generation aims to refine image generation by **incrementally incorporating subject details** from reference images. This approach tackles the challenge of preserving subject fidelity while maintaining controllability over the generated image. The **key idea is to transition smoothly** from text-to-image generation (T2I) to S2I. This often involves a two-stage process: initial training on single-subject data to learn basic subject alignment, followed by training on multi-subject data to handle more complex scenarios. **Cross-modal alignment is crucial** to prevent disruptions to the original T2I convergence. The progressive strategy aims to **mitigate training instability** and achieve better subject similarity and controllability. The **goal is to unlock better quality** and customization."}}, {"heading_title": "Synthetic Curation", "details": {"summary": "**Synthetic data curation** is presented as a vital solution to overcome the scarcity of high-quality, subject-consistent datasets, which has been a major impediment for subject-driven generation. The technique addresses the challenge of model training by constructing innovative pipelines. Specifically, it involves methods to create single-subject and multi-subject paired data through strategic text prompts. This also incorporates techniques like chaining to construct a better visual data. **Data filtering methods** based on vision-language models (VLMs) are employed to refine the synthesized data. The VLM metrics, coupled with strategies to remove inconsistencies, significantly improve dataset quality. This careful generation and refinement ensures that models trained on these data can achieve high levels of detail, adherence to textual descriptions, and subject similarity, thus pushing the boundaries of what is possible in controllable content generation."}}, {"heading_title": "Text Controllable", "details": {"summary": "While the paper doesn't explicitly have a section titled \"Text Controllable,\" the concept is interwoven throughout. The research aims to enhance image generation, ensuring the output aligns with provided textual prompts. **Achieving precise text control** is a core challenge, preventing models from ignoring or misinterpreting the text. The success hinges on a **robust understanding** of the text and translating it accurately into visual attributes, styles, and relationships within the generated image. The paper's methodology emphasizes meticulously crafted prompts. A progressive data synthesis pipeline is used where a large language model (LLM) is used to generate varied subjects and settings, and a vision-language model filters out poorly consistent pairs. The results emphasize a balance: preserving visual detail from reference images, while also being able to **edit** attributes, specifically colors, where other methods may struggle. This demonstrates the model's capacity to **adhere to specific editing instructions** from the text, further showcasing its control."}}]
