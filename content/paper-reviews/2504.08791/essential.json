This paper addresses the challenge of running large language models (LLMs) on resource-limited home devices, which typically struggle with existing solutions. Limited RAM/VRAM, GPU clusters, and high bandwidth demands make it difficult to run frontier models efficiently. The existing solutions struggle to balance workload distribution and prevent out-of-memory errors.\n\nThe paper introduces prima.cpp, a distributed inference system designed for low-resource home clusters. It uses mmap for model weights and introduces piped-ring parallelism with prefetching. The Halda algorithm optimizes layer assignments to devices. The system supports CPU/GPU mix and cross-platform deployment. Evaluation shows prima.cpp outperforms llama.cpp, exo, and dllama, achieving 15x speedup on 70B models with minimal memory pressure. It makes frontier models accessible to individuals.", "affiliation": "Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.08791/podcast.wav"}
