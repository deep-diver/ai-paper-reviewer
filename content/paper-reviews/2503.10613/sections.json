[{"heading_title": "LLM+A* Toolpath", "details": {"summary": "**Integrating LLMs with A* search for toolpath optimization presents a compelling approach**. LLMs offer high-level planning but lack precision in tool-specific costs. **A* excels in optimal path finding but struggles with the vast search space of AI tools**. A hybrid approach could leverage LLMs for subtask decomposition, pruning the tool search space, then employ A* on the smaller graph for cost-sensitive path discovery. **This balances global planning with local precision**, addressing the quality-cost trade-off by using LLM insights and A* optimization, leading to better tool selection and efficient solutions, improving results over LLM-only or A*-only search."}}, {"heading_title": "Cost vs. Quality", "details": {"summary": "**CoSTA* adeptly addresses the trade-off between cost and quality** in image editing. By using an A* search algorithm guided by a cost function that considers both execution time and output quality, it finds a path that balances these factors. The user can control the balance to **optimize the trade-off according to preferences**. With different cost-quality trade-off coefficients, it can achieve Pareto optimality dominating baselines on both metrics, offering more choices of tool use paths to cater to different use-cases based on budgets."}}, {"heading_title": "Multimodal Edit", "details": {"summary": "**Multimodal editing** represents a significant frontier in image manipulation, moving beyond simple text-guided edits to incorporate various modalities like sketches, audio, or even other images to guide the editing process. The central challenge lies in **effectively fusing information** from disparate sources, each with its unique semantic and structural properties.  This requires sophisticated architectures capable of **understanding cross-modal relationships** and resolving potential conflicts or ambiguities arising from inconsistent cues. A robust multimodal editing system needs to **strike a balance between adhering to user intent** expressed through multiple modalities and **maintaining the realism and coherence of the edited image**. Key research directions include developing **novel fusion mechanisms**, exploring techniques for **handling noisy or incomplete modal information**, and creating **intuitive interfaces** that allow users to seamlessly interact with the system using a variety of input methods. Ultimately, successful multimodal editing opens up exciting possibilities for creative expression and content creation."}}, {"heading_title": "TDG Automaton", "details": {"summary": "**TDG (Tool Dependency Graph) Automaton** could represent an agent that navigates the tool graph to solve image editing tasks. It will explore various tool paths using prior knowledge and benchmarks to enhance efficiency and quality, aiming to find the optimal sequence of tools to achieve the desired result. An **A* search** algorithm would guide the search on the graph."}}, {"heading_title": "Human > CLIP", "details": {"summary": "When assessing the correlation between human evaluations and CLIP scores, several insights emerge. It appears human evaluation is still crucial because CLIP might **not capture nuanced inaccuracies**. This is key, as relying solely on CLIP could lead to overlooking critical details or contextual understanding that a human evaluator would readily identify. The low correlation could be because CLIP might **struggle with complex tasks**, making it unreliable for holistic assessment but useful for individual subtasks. **Humans excel** where CLIP falls short because humans perform a more thorough job especially for nuanced multi-step and multi-modal"}}]
