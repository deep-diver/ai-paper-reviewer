These methods fail to maintain consistent identity over extended video and reduce natural motion. The core issue lies in the domain shift between static reference images & dynamic video sequences, hindering performance during inference.\n\nTo solve this, **MagicID** is introduced, a framework promoting identity-consistent, dynamic-rich videos via hybrid preference optimization. It uses pairwise preference video data with identity & dynamic rewards for learning. A hybrid sampling strategy leverages static videos for identity & enhances motion. Extensive experiments show MagicID achieves identity & natural dynamics, surpassing existing methods.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.12689/podcast.wav"}
