{"importance": "This paper matters because **SPF-Portrait** offers a refined method for portrait customization, which can maintain high-quality results and opens new research directions in personalized content generation, and disentangled representation learning. It also shows how to avoid semantic pollution in text-driven image editing.", "summary": "SPF-Portrait: Pure portrait customization via semantic pollution-free fine-tuning.", "takeaways": ["SPF-Portrait is the first to customize attributes while eliminating semantic pollution in text-driven portrait customization.", "Semantic-Aware Fine Control alignment process is capable of preserving the original model's behavior while meticulously preventing over-alignment.", "Response enhancement mechanism improves effectiveness of target semantics while alleviating representation gaps in direct cross-modal supervision."], "tldr": "Fine-tuning T2I models for portrait attribute customization suffers from semantic pollution, where target semantics entangle with redundant features. This disrupts the original model's behavior. Existing methods struggle to maintain the model's original capabilities and achieve incremental learning, leading to undesirable changes in portrait identity, posture, and background. They often fail to isolate and control the specific attributes being customized. \n\nThe paper introduces **SPF-Portrait**, a dual-path pipeline using the original model as a reference. It employs contrastive learning to adapt target attributes and align unrelated ones with the original portrait. A Semantic-Aware Fine Control Map guides alignment spatially, and a response enhancement mechanism reinforces target attribute performance. **SPF-Portrait** minimizes semantic pollution, preserves original model behavior, and improves customization.", "affiliation": "Shenzhen University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.00396/podcast.wav"}
