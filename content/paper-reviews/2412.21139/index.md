### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current language model based software engineering agents are limited by proprietary models and a lack of suitable training environments that reflect real-world challenges. Existing datasets either lack executable environments, reward signals, or contain unrealistic synthetic instructions. This paper introduces SWE-Gym, the first publicly-available training environment that combines real-world software engineering tasks, executable environments, and reward signals. SWE-Gym contains 2,438 real-world Python task instances sourced from popular open-source repositories. 

The researchers use SWE-Gym to train language model based software engineering agents, achieving up to 19% absolute gains in resolve rate on popular benchmarks. They also demonstrate inference-time scaling through verifiers trained on agent trajectories. Combining fine-tuned agents with verifiers, they achieve a new state-of-the-art performance. To facilitate further research, they publicly release SWE-Gym, models, and agent trajectories.

### In-depth insights


#### SWE-Gym: A New Env
The heading "SWE-Gym: A New Env" suggests a research paper introducing a novel software engineering training environment.  **SWE-Gym likely provides a realistic and comprehensive simulation of real-world software development tasks**, allowing researchers to train and evaluate software agents in a more controlled setting compared to real-world scenarios.  The "New Env" portion implies that this environment offers significant improvements or unique features not found in existing tools.  This could include a more realistic problem representation, integration with actual development tools, the use of executable code evaluation, or the availability of large, high-quality datasets of software engineering tasks.  **The paper likely focuses on the design, implementation, and evaluation of SWE-Gym's capabilities**, demonstrating how it addresses limitations of previous approaches.  **Key aspects would be the benchmark tasks used, agent performance metrics employed, and the reproducibility of the environment.** The overall contribution is likely to advance research in the area of automated software engineering and AI-powered development tools.

#### Agent Training
The agent training process, a crucial aspect of the research, focuses on using a novel environment, SWE-Gym, to train language models as software engineering agents.  **SWE-Gym's real-world task instances, complete with executable environments and test suites**, provide a significant advantage over previous methods that relied on synthetic or incomplete data. The training leverages reinforcement learning techniques, specifically rejection sampling, to improve agent performance.  **The use of two agent scaffolds, OpenHands and MoatlessTools**, demonstrates the approach's adaptability to different workflows.  Furthermore, the training data itself is investigated, with studies showing the importance of balanced datasets and the impact of data scaling methods on final agent capability.  **Results indicate that training on SWE-Gym leads to substantial improvements in the agent's ability to solve real-world software engineering problems**, pushing the state-of-the-art for open-weight SWE agents.  The scalability of the training process, showing continuous improvement with increased compute, is also highlighted as a key finding.

#### Verifier Approach
The effectiveness of the proposed SWE-Gym environment is significantly enhanced by a novel verifier approach.  This approach leverages the power of **machine learning** to evaluate the quality of agent-generated solutions. By training a verifier model on agent trajectories from SWE-Gym, the system gains the ability to **distinguish between successful and unsuccessful solutions**. This is crucial because it enables **inference-time scaling**, allowing the system to sample multiple solutions and select the optimal one based on the verifier's assessment.  The verifier's capacity to accurately predict success probabilities significantly boosts overall system performance. The integration of the verifier demonstrates a **systematic improvement** over simpler methods and highlights the importance of utilizing learned models for robust evaluation in complex software engineering tasks. This method directly addresses the challenges of evaluating solution quality, a key limitation in existing benchmarks that use human evaluation or less sophisticated techniques.  **Furthermore, continuous improvements** in both training and inference time scaling are shown as more compute is utilized.

#### Scalable Training
The concept of "Scalable Training" in the context of AI models for software engineering is crucial for practical applications.  The paper highlights the need to move beyond limited datasets and resource-intensive training methods.  **Efficient training is achieved by leveraging a new environment, SWE-Gym, that contains a large number of real-world software engineering tasks.**  This scalability is demonstrated through consistent performance gains with increasing amounts of training data, showing that the environment's size isn't a bottleneck.  **The training process also demonstrates scalability through the use of sampling techniques.**  Multiple trajectories are generated and the best solution is selected, highlighting effective inference-time scaling through verification models. This strategy shows considerable promise for balancing resource allocation with performance gains.  Overall, the focus on scalable training underscores the significance of creating practical AI systems that can be deployed and utilized effectively in real-world software engineering scenarios.

#### Future Directions
Future research should **focus on enhancing the scalability and robustness of SWE-Gym**.  This includes expanding the dataset to encompass a wider range of programming languages, project sizes, and development styles.  **Improving the efficiency of environment setup** is crucial to reduce the computational overhead and facilitate broader adoption.  The development of more sophisticated verifier models, capable of handling complex scenarios and providing more nuanced feedback, is essential.  Investigating advanced training methodologies like reinforcement learning, which may prove more effective in handling the inherent complexity of SWE tasks, would be valuable. Finally, exploring the use of SWE-Gym in different areas, such as security testing and code generation, should be considered to broaden its impact on software engineering research and development.

The zero-shot setting reveals a long-tail distribution, indicating a bias towards easier tasks.  The x-axis shows the number of successful trajectories for each task, while the y-axis represents the number of tasks with that many successful trajectories.  The authors highlight how 'per-instance capping' (limiting the number of successful attempts per task) mitigates the bias towards easy tasks. However, this method also decreases the total number of trajectories available for training.

> üîº This figure demonstrates how increasing the computational resources allocated to inference improves the performance of software engineering agents on the SWE-Bench Verified dataset.  The experiment uses a fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B language model as both the agent and verifier. The agent utilizes the OpenHands framework for its interactions.  The initial inference uses a temperature of 0, while subsequent inferences use a temperature of 0.5. The graph illustrates the relationship between the number of agent rollouts (attempts to solve the problem) and the success rate (resolve rate).  The improvement in performance is directly tied to increased compute, enabling the exploration of multiple solution candidates.

> üîº Table 7 details the distribution of successful trajectories used in the training-time scaling experiments of section 4.2.  The table shows how the number of trajectories changes when different sampling methods are applied.  The original data contains all successful trajectories, while the 'Dedup.' column shows the data after deduplication (one successful trajectory kept per instance ID). 'Sorted by random (repo) X% (Dedup.)' represents subsets of the deduplicated data, where the first X% of instances are randomly selected (or sorted by repository name). This allows for analysis of how different data sampling strategies (random and repository-based) affect the results of the experiments.
