This limits their ability to capture complex patterns and achieve optimal performance.  The issue is particularly pronounced when dealing with long sequences or tasks requiring fine-grained distinctions between similar inputs.\n\nTo tackle this problem, researchers propose **Layer-Integrated Memory (LIMe)**, a method that expands the model's representational capacity while maintaining its overall memory footprint. LIMe allows access to hidden states from previous layers through a learned routing mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse architectures and lookup mechanisms demonstrate LIMe's consistent performance improvements. Analyses reveal how LIMe efficiently integrates information across layers, suggesting promising research directions for building deeper and more robust Transformer models.", "affiliation": "T-Tech HSE University Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.09245/podcast.wav"}
