### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for zero-shot customized video generation often struggle due to suboptimal feature extraction and injection techniques, relying on extra models and adding complexity.  These methods often fail to maintain consistent subject appearance and diversity in generated videos.  This leads to subpar results, hindering the potential of this exciting field.

VideoMaker directly uses a pre-trained video diffusion model (VDM) as both a fine-grained feature extractor and injector.  It achieves this by inputting a reference image and employing the VDM's spatial self-attention mechanism to align subject features with the generated content naturally.  This innovative approach improves subject fidelity and video diversity while significantly reducing model complexity and training time.  Experiments validate the superior performance of VideoMaker compared to existing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### VDM's Inherent Force
The core concept of "VDM's Inherent Force" revolves around the **unexpected capabilities** of Video Diffusion Models (VDMs).  The authors argue that existing methods for customized video generation rely on external components, like additional networks, to extract and inject subject features. This approach is deemed suboptimal due to the added complexity and limitations.  Instead, they propose leveraging the **inherent ability** of pre-trained VDMs to perform these tasks.  **Directly inputting reference images** acts as a potent way to extract detailed features, bypassing the need for separate feature extractors.  Furthermore, the paper highlights the **spatial self-attention mechanism** within VDMs as a natural means for feature injection, enabling fine-grained control over the subject's presence in the generated video.  This reliance on the VDM's own internal mechanisms represents a significant paradigm shift, suggesting a more efficient and effective approach to zero-shot customized video generation.  This inherent force, therefore, is the **unleashed potential of pre-trained VDMs**, allowing for sophisticated video customization without the need for extensive auxiliary models or extensive finetuning.

#### Zero-shot Customization
Zero-shot customization in video generation is a significant advancement, enabling the creation of specific videos without the need for subject-specific training data.  This is achieved by leveraging the inherent capabilities of pre-trained Video Diffusion Models (VDMs).  **Instead of relying on extra modules for feature extraction and injection**, which often leads to inconsistencies, this approach directly uses the VDM's intrinsic processes.  This involves using the VDM's feature extraction capabilities on a reference image, effectively obtaining fine-grained subject features already aligned with the model's knowledge.  **A novel bidirectional interaction between subject and generated content is then established within the VDM using spatial self-attention**, ensuring the subject's fidelity while maintaining the diversity of the video. This eliminates the need for additional training parameters and complicated architectures, making the process more efficient and effective. **The inherent force of the VDM is thus activated**, eliminating the limitations of previous heuristic approaches. This is a promising step towards more flexible and practical video generation systems, especially in applications requiring rapid customization and diverse video outputs.

#### Self-Attention Injection
The concept of 'Self-Attention Injection' in the context of video generation using diffusion models presents a novel approach to incorporating subject features.  Instead of relying on external modules or heuristic methods, **this technique leverages the inherent spatial self-attention mechanism within the Video Diffusion Model (VDM) itself.**  This is crucial because it avoids the introduction of additional training parameters and potential misalignment issues often encountered when injecting features extraneously. By directly interacting subject features with the generated content through spatial self-attention, the VDM can maintain better subject fidelity while promoting the diversity of generated video sequences. **The bidirectional interaction ensures that the model doesn't overfit to the subject features while still preserving subject appearance consistency.**  This approach also aligns well with the VDM's pre-trained knowledge, leading to more natural and high-fidelity results.  The effectiveness of self-attention injection lies in its ability to perform fine-grained feature interaction, going beyond coarse-grained semantic-level feature integration used in prior methods.  This methodology ultimately represents a significant shift from heuristic methods towards exploiting the model's innate capabilities for customized video generation.

#### Ablation Study Analysis
An ablation study systematically removes components of a model to assess their individual contributions.  In the context of a video generation model, this might involve removing or disabling elements such as the **spatial self-attention mechanism**, the **guidance information recognition loss**, or the **subject feature extraction process**. By observing how performance metrics (like FID, CLIP-score, etc.) change after each ablation, researchers can quantitatively determine the importance of each module.  A well-executed ablation study demonstrates not just the overall effectiveness but also the **internal working and relative contributions of various architectural choices**. For instance, removing the spatial self-attention module might show a significant drop in subject fidelity, indicating that this component is crucial for integrating subject features into the video generation process.  The ablation study also helps highlight the **design choices** that positively contribute to model robustness and effectiveness.  **A comprehensive ablation study is therefore a crucial aspect of assessing the novelty and quality of the work** by proving the necessity of each chosen component in the overall pipeline. 

#### Future Research
Future research directions for zero-shot customized video generation should prioritize enhancing **model robustness** and **generalization capabilities**.  Addressing limitations in handling diverse subjects and complex scenes is crucial.  Exploring alternative feature extraction methods beyond direct VDM input, such as incorporating **pre-trained visual encoders**, could improve performance.  Investigating more sophisticated feature injection mechanisms, potentially using **attention-based architectures** or **diffusion model modifications**, warrants investigation to ensure fidelity and diversity.  Furthermore, **developing larger and more diverse datasets** is essential for improving model generalization and reducing biases.  Finally, exploring the potential for **incorporating user feedback** during generation and developing **metrics for evaluating subjective qualities** like artistic style and emotional impact would significantly advance the field.

> üîº This figure compares the proposed VideoMaker framework with existing zero-shot customized video generation methods.  Existing methods typically employ additional modules for subject feature extraction and injection, often involving complex processes like using a separate ReferenceNet or cross-modal alignment models. In contrast, VideoMaker leverages the inherent capabilities of Video Diffusion Models (VDMs). It directly inputs the reference image and the generated video frames into the VDM, relying on the VDM's internal mechanisms (like spatial self-attention) to extract and inject the subject's features naturally without extra modules.  This streamlined approach is highlighted to demonstrate the simplicity and efficiency of the proposed method.

> üîº The figure illustrates the architecture of VideoMaker, a novel framework for zero-shot customized video generation.  It leverages the inherent capabilities of Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) rather than relying on external modules. The process begins by directly inputting a reference image into the VDM.

A key modification involves altering the spatial self-attention mechanism within the VDM to effectively inject these extracted features into the video generation process.  Finally, a novel 'Guidance Information Recognition Loss' is introduced to help the model distinguish between the reference image features and the newly generated video content, thus improving the overall quality and consistency of the generated video.
