Traditional methods produce unrealistic results, require multi-view videos which are inconvenient. Recent advancements leverage image and video diffusion models, but struggle with dynamic videos from static methods, and implicit pose embeddings. This paper introduces methods with fixed poses and synthetic multi-view datasets, but performance suffers from domain gaps between real & synthetic videos.\n\nThis paper introduces a new framework that generates high-fidelity videos with user-defined camera trajectories from monocular inputs. **The proposed method, TrajectoryCrafter, disentangles deterministic view transformations from stochastic content generation, and leverages monocular reconstruction to model 3D transformations via point cloud renders**. A dual-stream diffusion model combines point cloud renders and source videos for 4D consistency and broadens generalization. **The method uses a hybrid training dataset of static multi-view and web-scale monocular videos**.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.05638/podcast.wav"}
