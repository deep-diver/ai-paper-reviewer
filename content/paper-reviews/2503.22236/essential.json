These limitations affect the realism, precision, and applicability of generated 3D models, hindering the ability to capture complex real-world geometric characteristics.\n\nTo address these challenges, the paper presents a framework that uses normal maps as an intermediate representation to bridge 2D images and 3D geometry. The method includes an image-to-normal estimator (NiRNE) with noise injection and dual-stream training for robust estimation, normal-regularized latent diffusion learning to enhance 3D geometry fidelity, and a 3D data synthesis pipeline (DetailVerse) to provide high-quality training data. **This approach enhances the generation of fine geometric details and outperforms existing methods.**", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.22236/podcast.wav"}
