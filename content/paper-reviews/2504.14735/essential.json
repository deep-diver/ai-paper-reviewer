The unknown distribution of effect parameters leads to the use of noninformative priors, biasing downstream tasks like effects detection and style transfer. Collecting real-world data with effect parameter annotations is challenging, hindering the creation of realistic automatic audio processing tools. \n\nTo solve this, the study introduces **DiffVox**, a novel model for matching vocal effects via differentiable programming. It integrates parametric equalisation, dynamic range control, delay, and reverb, enabling gradient-based optimization for parameter estimation. By fitting the model to hundreds of vocal tracks and analyzing the resulting parameters, the research provides insights into real-world vocal effects configurations and their distributions.", "affiliation": "Queen Mary University of London", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Audio Enhancement"}, "podcast_path": "2504.14735/podcast.wav"}
