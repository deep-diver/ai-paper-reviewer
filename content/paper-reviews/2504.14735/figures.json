The central part shows the overall flow of audio through the various effects modules.  The diagram shows how a mono input signal is processed sequentially using a parametric equalizer (PEQ), a compressor and expander (COMP), and then split into dry and wet signals. The wet signal is further processed in parallel using a ping-pong delay (DLY) and a feedback delay network reverb (FDN). The processed wet and dry signals are finally mixed and outputted as a stereo signal.  Individual boxes represent each of these effects, detailing the processing path in a visual, step-by-step manner.", "section": "2.
