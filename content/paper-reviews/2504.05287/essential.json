Previous methods often rely on fully observable objects or pre-defined grasping poses, limiting their adaptability. This research addresses these limitations by introducing a **reinforcement-learning-based framework that enables robots to grasp a wide range of objects from a single-view**, even when facing external disturbances, thus enhancing the robustness to shape variance and uncertainty. \n\nThe framework, named \"Robust Dexterous Grasping\",  uses a **hand-centric object representation to extract local shapes** relevant to interactions, and it employs a mixed curriculum learning strategy to train a policy that adapts to disturbances. **Experiments demonstrate strong generalization in grasping unseen objects**, achieving high success rates in both simulation and real-world scenarios. The method also shows robustness to object movement and external forces.", "affiliation": "ETH Z\u00fcrich", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05287/podcast.wav"}
