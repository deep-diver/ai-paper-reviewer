It focuses on creating high-quality \"3D Bundle Images\" that effectively capture the geometry and texture of objects. A key design principle involves aligning these bundle images with the prior knowledge embedded in pre-trained 2D image diffusion models. This alignment helps preserve the generative capabilities of the pre-trained model. The process leverages **ISOMER to produce textured 3D meshes** from these bundle images. A DiT model, specifically Flux, is used to capture long-range dependencies for coherent multi-view relationships.

The paper addresses this by leveraging a **'3D Bundle Image' representation**, effectively transforming the 3D generation problem into a 2D image generation task. This approach is designed to maintain a consistent level of detail, as the model leverages knowledge from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. Furthermore, the integration of ControlNet allows for controlled enhancement and editing, ensuring details align across views and modalities. The use of a DiT model, especially the architecture's attention blocks, is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies, ensuring coherence in multi-view relationships. By balancing enhancement strength with control, the framework achieves consistent detail by retaining original mesh semantics while enriching texture and geometry, showcasing effectiveness of our approach."}}]
