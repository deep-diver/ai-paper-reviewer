Current methods produce unstructured outputs, incur high computational costs, or are limited to generating simple icons. To address these limitations, OmniSVG emerges as a unified framework utilizing Vision-Language Models (VLMs) for end-to-end multimodal SVG generation. \n\nOmniSVG parameterizes SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, decoupling structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training while retaining expressiveness. The introduction of MMSVG-2M, a multimodal dataset with two million annotated SVG assets, and standardized evaluation protocols further advances SVG synthesis. Experiments reveal that OmniSVG outperforms existing methods, showcasing its potential for professional SVG design workflows.", "affiliation": "Fudan University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.06263/podcast.wav"}
