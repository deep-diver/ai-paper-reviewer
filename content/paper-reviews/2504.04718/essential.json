This paper addresses this gap by investigating if sLMs can reliably self-verify. Results show sLMs struggle with tasks requiring memorization, like numerical calculations, even with knowledge distillation, highlighting limitations due to limited capacity.** The key question is: Can sLMs reliably self-verify for test-time scaling? This challenge motivates a search for efficient verification methods that don't rely on large verifiers. \n\nTo address this, the authors introduce **Tool-integrated self-verification (T1), delegating memory-intensive verification steps to external tools like code interpreters.** Theoretical analysis shows T1 reduces memorization needs and enhances scaling. Experiments on MATH and MMLU-Pro show that a Llama-3.2 1B model with T1 outperforms larger models, proving T1 effectively improves sLM self-verification abilities. T1 integrates well with existing verification techniques to reach better performances.", "affiliation": "KRAFTON", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.04718/podcast.wav"}
