Recent studies have observed that many of the layers in these models are less effective than expected, leading to wasted resources. This phenomenon is often referred to as the 'Curse of Depth'. This research paper delves into this problem, investigating the reason behind the ineffectiveness of deep layers.  The researchers find that this is largely due to a common technique called Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN), which causes the output variance of the deeper layers to grow exponentially during training, ultimately hindering their contribution. \nTo address this issue, the authors propose a novel technique called LayerNorm Scaling. This simple method scales the output variance of each layer inversely proportional to the square root of its depth. By doing so, it effectively prevents the exponential variance growth and improves the performance of deeper layers.  The researchers conducted extensive experiments, demonstrating that LayerNorm Scaling not only improves the training efficiency of LLMs but also enhances their performance on various downstream tasks.  This shows that the method is not just a theoretical improvement but a practical solution for improving large language model training.", "affiliation": "Medical Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, Westlake University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.05795/podcast.wav"}
