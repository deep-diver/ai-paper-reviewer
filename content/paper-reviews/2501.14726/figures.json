It demonstrates the reconstruction of a complete human model, including body, face, and hands, from input data.  The key innovation is the ability to relight the avatar under various lighting conditions (as shown in the \"Env. map relighting\" section) and animate it expressively (\"Animation\"), even showing unseen poses.  The technique achieves photorealism through a combination of learned diffuse radiance transport (modeling how light interacts with the avatar's surface) and deferred shading for specular effects (like highlights and reflections).
