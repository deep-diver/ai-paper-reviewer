Existing models often prioritize visual fidelity, neglecting the need for smaller, more efficient models suitable for real-world deployment. Thus, how do we achieve both computational efficiency and high visual performance, and the large model sizes hinder deployment on edge devices. To address this, a novel approach in needed to pruning the network structure without causing performance degradation. \n\nTo tackle this, the paper introduces **Hummingbird, a lightweight T2V framework** that prunes existing models and enhances visual quality through visual feedback learning, reducing the U-Net size from 1.4B to 0.7B parameters. It also presents a novel data processing pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs) and Video Quality Assessment (VQA) models to improve text prompts and video data quality. Experimental results demonstrate a 31\u00d7 speedup over state-of-the-art models like VideoCrafter2, achieving the highest VBench score.
