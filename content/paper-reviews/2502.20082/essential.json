The core issue is the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem in rotary positional embeddings (RoPE), where higher dimensions aren't sufficiently trained. Previous rescaling methods don't fully address this, leading to suboptimal performance and the need for extensive retraining.\n\nTo solve these issues, LongRoPE2 adopts a new approach: It uses needle-driven perplexity evaluation and evolutionary search to identify optimal RoPE rescaling factors, focusing on critical answer tokens. Mixed context window training simultaneously trains with original and rescaled RoPE, preserving short-context performance while adapting to long sequences. Experiments show that LongRoPE2 achieves state-of-the-art results, extending context windows to 128k with minimal performance loss and significantly less training data.
