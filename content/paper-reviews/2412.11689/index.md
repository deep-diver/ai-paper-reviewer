### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Vertical Federated Learning (VFL) allows multiple parties to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model on datasets with different features without directly sharing raw data. However, **VFL is still susceptible to privacy attacks**, like feature reconstruction, where attackers attempt to rebuild the private data. Existing attacks, like Model Inversion and Feature-space Hijacking, exploit knowledge of the data distribution and focus on models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These attacks work by accessing the model's architecture or utilizing an auxiliary public dataset to infer the private data.

This paper demonstrates that a **simple change in model architecture** can significantly enhance data protection in VFL. The researchers theoretically and empirically prove that Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), networks made up of simple interconnected layers, are **robust to feature reconstruction attacks**, particularly state-of-the-art attacks like Model Inversion and Feature-space Hijacking. **They highlight that these attacks are successful mostly because they use prior knowledge about the data distribution and CNNs** lack specific architectural properties that MLPs possess. This work theoretically explains this behaviour and provides experiments confirming their results, suggesting that **MLPs offer an effective defense mechanism against feature reconstruction attacks by themselves** and do not require additional complex changes to their privacy-preserving structure.

### In-depth insights


#### VFL Data Privacy
**Vertical Federated Learning (VFL)** aims to enhance data privacy during collaborative model training.  It enables multiple parties with vertically partitioned data (different features for the same set of samples) to train a shared model without directly exchanging their raw data.  However, **VFL remains vulnerable to attacks** such as feature reconstruction, model inversion, and label inference. Attackers exploit intermediate outputs (activations) or model architecture information to infer sensitive private data. Therefore, **robust defense mechanisms are crucial for ensuring data protection** in VFL. Several approaches exist, including adding noise (differential privacy), obfuscating data, and adversarial training. The effectiveness of these defenses depends on factors like noise levels, obfuscation techniques, and the specific attack model.  **Architectural design also plays a significant role in VFL privacy**. Using **MLP-based models** for the client-side can improve data protection against some attacks, hindering feature reconstruction attempts.  Further research is needed to develop more advanced defense strategies, address vulnerabilities of different architectures, and balance privacy with model utility in VFL.

#### Transformation Protection
Analyzing data protection in Vertical Federated Learning (VFL), specifically focusing on **feature reconstruction attacks**, reveals that **simple transformations** can significantly enhance data privacy.  Prior knowledge of data distribution is crucial for these attacks to succeed.  Remarkably, **MLP-based models demonstrate resilience** against state-of-the-art attacks like Model Inversion and Feature-space Hijacking. This resilience stems from the inherent nature of dense layers within MLPs, disrupting the attacker's ability to reconstruct activations, thereby protecting the original data.  This observation highlights a potential shift in architectural design for privacy preservation in VFL, **emphasizing the importance of MLPs or the inclusion of dense layers** within existing architectures.

#### MLP-based VFL
**MLP-based VFL** leverages Multilayer Perceptrons for vertical federated learning. This approach is particularly relevant where data features are distributed among multiple parties. Using MLPs offers an advantage: **resistance to feature reconstruction attacks**, like Model Inversion and Feature-Space Hijacking, which commonly exploit CNN vulnerabilities.  This robustness stems from the dense layer structure in MLPs, disrupting the attacker's ability to infer private data. Consequently, **MLP-based VFL enhances privacy** without complex cryptographic methods, simplifying implementation and reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Notably, the effectiveness extends even to simple MLP structures, highlighting its practicality.  Further research could explore its potential in diverse domains beyond image datasets where MLPs are prevalent, like NLP and tabular learning.

#### Attack Failures
**Analyzing attack failures reveals critical insights into system vulnerabilities and defense strategies.**  A deep dive into unsuccessful attacks helps pinpoint specific weaknesses exploited.  This understanding allows for **targeted strengthening of defenses**, prioritizing areas with demonstrated vulnerability.  Moreover, studying attack failures can **uncover novel attack vectors** that were previously unknown.  Examining the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) employed in failed attacks allows defenders to anticipate and proactively mitigate future threats.  By understanding the reasons behind attack failures, such as detection mechanisms or system resilience, organizations can **improve their overall security posture.** This knowledge informs resource allocation, prioritizing defenses that have proven effective. **Furthermore, studying attack failures encourages a proactive mindset, shifting from reactive responses to anticipatory defense.** This includes continuous monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing to identify and address weaknesses before they are successfully exploited.

#### Defense Quality
**Evaluating defense effectiveness against feature reconstruction attacks requires a human-centric approach.** While MSE is commonly used, it doesn't align well with human perception of image quality.  **FID offers a more perceptually aligned metric**, reflecting how humans perceive differences between real and reconstructed images.  **This shift is crucial for assessing privacy risks**, as a defense deemed successful by MSE might still reveal sensitive information discernible by humans.  Therefore, **FID provides a more robust evaluation** of how well a defense truly safeguards against data leakage.

> üîº This figure presents the Encoder-Decoder error and the Reconstruction error for the Feature-space Hijacking Attack (FSHA). The Encoder-Decoder error represents the mean squared error (MSE) between the original images from a public dataset and the images reconstructed using an encoder-decoder model. The Reconstruction error, on the other hand, denotes the MSE between the original private data held by the client and the data reconstructed by the attacker (server) using the client‚Äôs model activations. The figure showcases these errors for both CNN-based and MLP-based client models across MNIST and Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST) datasets. It illustrates that the encoder-decoder pair performs equally well in reconstructing public data, irrespective of the client's model architecture. However, the attack's success in reconstructing private data significantly depends on the client-side architecture, with MLP-based models demonstrating greater resistance to reconstruction.

> üîº This figure demonstrates how the Adam optimizer's performance can be affected by initialization when applied to the non-convex function f(y) = y¬≤ + 6sin¬≤(y), where y = W·µÄX. The plot shows the function's value over optimization steps for two different initializations of W and X. The 'before rotation' line represents the optimization path with the original initialization, converging towards the global minimum at y = 0. The 'after rotation' line shows the optimization path after applying an orthogonal transformation to both W and X. In this scenario, the optimizer gets stuck in a local minimum, failing to reach the global optimum. This illustrates that for non-convex functions, the behavior of Adam, and potentially other adaptive optimizers, can be sensitive to the initial values of the weights and data.

The table compares the effectiveness of reconstruction with and without adding the DP noise.  Each row represents a different split depth (cut layer), with 'Ref.' showing the original images. The DP noise variance (œÉ) is set differently for each dataset to balance privacy and utility. It's worth noting that while the theoretical œÉ for CIFAR-10 is 7.1, it was lowered to 0.25 due to complications in training.
