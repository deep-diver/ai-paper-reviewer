### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing methods for three-dimensional scene inpainting struggle with maintaining view consistency and geometric accuracy, especially in 360° unbounded scenes.  This is a significant challenge for applications like virtual and augmented reality, where realistic scene manipulation is crucial.  These issues stem from the difficulties in accurately identifying and filling unseen regions in 3D scenes represented by multiple views.  Inconsistent depth estimation and difficulties in handling large viewpoint changes also hinder performance.

The paper introduces AuraFusion360, a novel reference-based method that leverages Gaussian Splatting for efficient 3D scene representation. Key innovations include depth-aware unseen mask generation for accurate occlusion identification, Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion (AGDD) for structured initial point placement, and SDEdit-based detail enhancement for multi-view coherence. The proposed method significantly outperforms existing techniques in both perceptual quality and geometric accuracy, even with dramatic viewpoint changes.  Furthermore, it introduces 360-USID, a new dataset for 360° unbounded scene inpainting, providing a valuable benchmark for future research.

> 🔼 AuraFusion360 takes input images, camera parameters, object masks, and a reference image.  It uses these to create an object-masked Gaussian Splatting representation of the scene. This representation allows the system to generate novel views of the scene with the masked objects removed, while maintaining consistency with the reference image. The figure visually depicts this process, showing the input data, the intermediate Gaussian splatting representation, and the final inpainted novel views.

> Figure 1:  Overview of our reference-based 360° unbounded scene inpainting method. Given input images with camera parameters, object masks, and a reference image, our AuraFusion360 approach generates an object-masked Gaussian Splatting representation. This representation can then render novel views of the inpainted scene, effectively removing the masked objects while maintaining consistency with the reference image.

### In-depth insights


#### 360° Inpainting
360° inpainting presents unique challenges compared to traditional image inpainting due to its inherent complexity.  **View consistency** is paramount;  any inpainting solution must seamlessly blend across multiple perspectives, avoiding jarring discontinuities. **Geometric accuracy** is another key factor, as the inpainted regions must maintain consistent spatial relationships with the surrounding scene to preserve realism.  **Handling unseen regions**, areas occluded in all input views, requires sophisticated techniques capable of plausible reconstruction.  Existing methods often struggle with these aspects, especially in unbounded scenes, highlighting a need for innovative approaches that leverage multi-view information effectively.  **Reference-based methods** show promise, but often suffer from limitations in viewpoint variation and overall consistency.  **Data scarcity** also poses a major hurdle, emphasizing the importance of creating high-quality 360° datasets with ground truth for rigorous evaluation.  Successful 360° inpainting solutions will likely involve robust depth estimation and geometry-aware generative models that integrate semantic information effectively to maintain consistent 3D structure across multiple viewpoints.

#### Depth-Aware Masks
The concept of 'Depth-Aware Masks' in the context of 360° unbounded scene inpainting is crucial for accurately identifying regions requiring inpainting.  A naive approach might simply use existing object masks; however, **depth information adds a critical layer of understanding**. By analyzing depth disparities, a depth-aware method can distinguish between areas genuinely occluded (unseen regions) and those merely hidden behind objects in specific views. This is **vital for maintaining consistency across multiple viewpoints**, avoiding the hallucination of content where it's impossible to infer visually from the available data.  Such depth-aware techniques are **essential for avoiding artifacts and producing visually plausible results** that successfully integrate the newly generated information with the existing scene's geometry, especially in challenging 360° scenes where viewpoint changes dramatically impact what's visible. The success of the approach relies heavily on accurate and reliable depth maps, which could be improved with advanced algorithms or further refined by incorporating additional sensory inputs.

#### AGDD Diffusion
The Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion (AGDD) method is a **novel approach** for aligning depth maps in 360° unbounded scenes, a crucial step for high-quality 3D inpainting.  Traditional depth estimation methods struggle with scale ambiguity and inconsistencies in 360° views. **AGDD addresses this by iteratively refining depth estimates**, using a VAE decoder and an adaptive loss function that compares the estimated depth to the existing incomplete depth. This ensures that the final depth map aligns well with the existing structure, **providing a robust foundation for subsequent Gaussian splatting initialization**. The use of a bounding box and thresholding in the loss function further improves efficiency and accuracy, enabling zero-shot application without requiring additional training. The **method's effectiveness is demonstrated by its superior performance** compared to other depth completion techniques in aligning depth across viewpoints, leading to improved consistency and accuracy in the final inpainted scene.

#### SDEdit Enhancement
The section on "SDEdit Enhancement" within the research paper likely details how the authors leverage Stable Diffusion's editing capabilities (SDEdit) to refine the quality of their 360° scene inpainting.  **This likely involves using SDEdit's denoising process, possibly conditioned on the reference image or other relevant contextual information**, to iteratively improve the generated details and ensure visual consistency across multiple viewpoints.  The technique might address potential artifacts or inconsistencies introduced during the initial inpainting stage, achieving a higher level of realism and coherence in the final output.  **A key aspect might involve intelligently managing the noise injection process within SDEdit, perhaps by using a depth-aware mechanism or other techniques to selectively guide the refinement process.** This would focus the enhancements to critical areas requiring attention and prevent unwanted alterations in well-rendered parts.  **The effectiveness of this enhancement is likely evaluated through perceptual metrics**, comparing its impact on visual fidelity, geometric accuracy and multi-view consistency relative to baselines and other competing methods.  The authors probably discuss its crucial role in seamlessly merging newly generated regions with the pre-existing scene elements, resulting in a highly cohesive and visually appealing 360° inpainted scene.

#### Future of 360°
The future of 360° imaging and processing hinges on addressing current limitations. **Real-time performance** remains a challenge, especially for high-resolution scenes and complex manipulations.  Further advancements in **depth estimation** are crucial for accurate and robust unseen region identification, particularly in dynamic environments.  Integrating **AI-driven techniques**, such as improved object tracking and semantic understanding, will enhance scene consistency and enable more precise object removal and inpainting.  The development of **larger, more diverse datasets** is vital for training robust and generalizable models. Finally, **exploring novel representations** beyond Gaussian Splatting could lead to improved efficiency and accuracy, potentially unlocking the creation of truly interactive and immersive 360° experiences.  Research into more computationally efficient algorithms and hardware acceleration is essential for achieving real-time capabilities.

It shows that previous methods like SPIn-NeRF and GScream, designed for forward-facing scenes, perform poorly on 360° scenes. Reference-based methods like Infusion struggle with accurate reference view projection, leading to artifacts. Gaussian Grouping often misidentifies unseen regions, impacting quality.

Previous methods, such as SPin-NeRF [34] and GScream [60], are tailored for forward-facing scenes and tend to underperform in 360° unbounded scenarios. Reference-based methods, such as Infusion [27], whose depth completion model struggles to accurately project the reference view back into the 3D scene, leading to fine-tuning artifacts.

> 🔼 This figure illustrates the AuraFusion360 method for 360° unbounded scene inpainting.  The process begins with multi-view RGB images and their corresponding object masks.  These inputs are processed through three main stages:  1. **Depth-Aware Unseen Mask Generation:** Identifies areas completely hidden from all viewpoints (the 'unseen region'). 2. **Depth-Aligned Gaussian Initialization on Reference View:** Fills the unseen regions using a reference image.  Depth information from the reference view is projected into the 3D scene to guide the generation of new Gaussian splatting points. These points inherit RGB values from the reference image ensuring consistency. 3. **SDEdit-Based RGB Guidance for Detail Enhancement:**  Refines the generated image details using a diffusion model (SDEdit). Instead of random noise, DDIM inversion is used to retain the reference image's structure, thereby enhancing visual quality and maintaining consistency across all views. The output is a Gaussian splatting representation where the masked objects have been seamlessly removed and replaced with realistic inpainting.

The pipeline consists of three main stages: (a) Depth-Aware Unseen Masks Generation to identify truly occluded areas, referred to as the “unseen region”, (b) Depth-Aligned Gaussian Initialization on Reference View to fill unseen regions with initialized Gaussian containing reference RGB information after object removal, and (c) SDEdit-Based RGB Guidance for Detail Enhancement, which enhances fine details using an inpainting model while preserving reference view information. Instead of applying SDEdit with random noise, we use DDIM Inversion on the rendered initial Gaussians to generate noise that retains the structure of the reference view, ensuring multi-view consistency across all RGB Guidance.

> 🔼 This figure details the process of generating an unseen mask for a given view (n) in a 360° scene.  It leverages depth warping to accurately identify occluded regions. First, pixel correspondences are computed between view n and all other views (i) using the incomplete depth map of view n. Then, removal regions from each view i are warped back to view n to align occlusions. These warped regions are aggregated, and a threshold is applied to produce a contour representing the unseen mask in view n. Finally, this contour is converted into a bounding box prompt for the SAM2 model which further refines the unseen mask.

> 🔼 Adaptive Guided Depth Diffusion (AGDD) is an algorithm used to align estimated depth with existing depth, especially challenging in 360° unbounded scenes due to scale ambiguity and coordinate system differences.  AGDD uses a latent representation perturbed by full-strength Gaussian noise.  It iteratively updates the noise via an adaptive loss function comparing the pre-decoded estimated depth to the incomplete depth, ensuring alignment. A guided region (determined by dilating and subtracting the unseen mask) focuses the alignment process. This iterative refinement generates aligned depth that matches the incomplete depth distribution within the guided region, improving depth estimation in 360° unbounded scene inpainting.

The results show that object masks, while simple, fail to accurately capture geometric changes in the scene, leading to inaccurate identification of unseen regions.  Consequently, the subsequent inpainting step, using SAM2, is less effective. In contrast, using depth differences to define removal regions better preserves the scene's overall structure.  This leads to more accurate prompts for SAM2 and, ultimately, improved unseen region segmentation and overall better inpainting results.
