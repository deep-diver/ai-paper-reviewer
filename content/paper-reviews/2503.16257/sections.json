[{"heading_title": "VidKV: 1.x-bit", "details": {"summary": "**VidKV: 1.x-bit** presents a novel approach to KV cache quantization for video LLMs, targeting lower bit precisions (below 2 bits) to address memory bottlenecks. It introduces a **mixed-precision quantization** scheme, adapting bit allocation based on channel characteristics, using **2-bit for anomalous channels and 1-bit (with FFT) for normal channels** in the key cache. For the value cache, a **1.58-bit quantization** is employed, with an option for semantic token protection. VidKV explores how the KV caches should also be quantized in the per-channel form. Experiments show the effectiveness of this method in compressing KV caches while mostly retaining performance which leads to the conclusion that we can quantize the KV caches even lower than what we currently have."}}, {"heading_title": "VideoLLM Quant", "details": {"summary": "VideoLLM Quantization is crucial for efficient video processing. **KV cache quantization** is a primary method to reduce memory usage. Initial findings show **2-bit quantization** is almost lossless due to video token redundancy, prompting exploration of lower-bit quantization. Techniques like **mixed-precision quantization** for keys, using channel dimension analysis, and **1.58-bit quantization** for values, with selective preservation of salient tokens, are key areas. Unlike LLMs, VideoLLMs benefit more from **per-channel quantization** for value caches, as opposed to per-token. Future advancements might include strategies to handle challenges in **1-bit quantization**, like managing quantization errors caused by drastically fluctuating channels. The study shows the potential for more efficient VideoLLMs through quantization."}}, {"heading_title": "Channel-wise KV", "details": {"summary": "**Channel-wise KV quantization** presents a paradigm shift from per-token methods, potentially better aligning with the inherent structure of video data in VideoLLMs. The key insight is that, rather than each token being independently quantized, channels (representing feature dimensions) are quantized together. This is particularly relevant when considering the spatial and temporal redundancy present in video, where certain feature dimensions may exhibit similar characteristics across multiple tokens within a channel. **Channel-wise quantization allows for efficient compression** while retaining crucial information. The success of channel-wise over per-token highlights the importance of adapting quantization strategies to the specific data modality. Furthermore, It opens the door for exploring other adaptive quantization techniques, such as dynamic bit allocation across channels."}}, {"heading_title": "FFT Key Enhance", "details": {"summary": "Enhancing the key component using FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) could be a novel method to optimize KV cache quantization. **FFT can transform data into frequency domain**, potentially revealing patterns not obvious in the time domain. This transformation might **stabilize data distribution**, mitigating the impact of outliers and improving quantization accuracy. Further, **quantization errors can be minimized**, leading to a more compact and efficient representation of the key cache. **FFT-based enhancement can be combined with mixed-precision strategies**, allocating more bits to critical frequency components and fewer bits to less significant ones. This approach balances compression and performance. To leverage on **FFT's power in noise reduction**, the key part is enhanced for more refined quantization."}}, {"heading_title": "Future: 1-bit KV", "details": {"summary": "Exploring the future of 1-bit KV cache quantization presents significant challenges and opportunities. While the current research demonstrates promising results with 1.5-bit and 1.58-bit quantization, achieving stable and effective 1-bit quantization remains elusive. **The primary hurdle lies in the substantial information loss associated with such aggressive compression.** Mitigating this loss requires innovative approaches, such as highly selective token preservation strategies, more sophisticated quantization schemes that adapt to the unique characteristics of different KV cache elements, or leveraging external knowledge to compensate for the reduced precision. **Addressing this limitation is crucial to unlock the full potential of extremely low-bit quantization** for significantly reducing memory footprint and accelerating inference in large models."}}]
