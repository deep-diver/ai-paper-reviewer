### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for specific tasks often leads to a concerning drop in their safety.  Many current solutions try to fix this by adding more safety data, which is often difficult and expensive to obtain. This creates a challenge for researchers and developers who want to improve LLM performance while ensuring they remain safe and reliable. 

This research proposes a novel approach: merging the weights of the original, safety-aligned LLM (the 'base model') with the weights of the model after it has been fine-tuned for a specific task.  Experiments show that this simple method significantly reduces safety risks while actually improving performance across various tasks and models. **This offers a practical solution for building safer and more effective LLMs without the need for large amounts of extra data.**

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is important because **it offers a practical solution to a critical problem in fine-tuning large language models (LLMs): safety degradation.**  Current methods often require substantial additional safety data, which is scarce and expensive. This research provides a simple, effective, and data-efficient way to maintain LLM safety while improving performance, thus **advancing the responsible development and deployment of LLMs.** It opens new avenues for research into model merging techniques and their applications in mitigating safety risks during model adaptation for various downstream tasks.
