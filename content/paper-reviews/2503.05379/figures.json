Each model's output includes a textual explanation of its reasoning process, followed by its predicted emotion.  The ground truth emotion is also provided for comparison, enabling a visual assessment of the models' reasoning capabilities, emotion recognition accuracy, and overall performance. The goal is to showcase how the R1-Omni model, using the RLVR framework, provides more coherent and accurate reasoning compared to the other models.", "section": "3 R1-Omni"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.05379/extracted/6260654/figure/model_performance_by_metrics_with_ravdess.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Performance comparison of models on emotion recognition datasets.", "description": "This figure presents a bar chart comparing the performance of four different models on two emotion recognition datasets: DFEW and MAFW.

These examples highlight limitations such as inaccurate subtitle recognition, hallucination in reasoning (generating outputs not grounded in the video content), and the underutilization of audio cues for emotion recognition.  The examples show model outputs and ground truth, illustrating where the model's predictions are incorrect and the reasons for such failures.", "section": "5 Limitations"}]
