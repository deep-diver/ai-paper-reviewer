### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Long-context language models (LLMs) struggle with memory efficiency, especially when dealing with multiple requests and reusable contexts. Current benchmarks evaluate models on single requests, overlooking the important aspect of Key-Value (KV) cache reuse, common in real-world applications like chatbots. This leads to unrealistic evaluations, as models often reuse previous context to save computation. Efficient long-context solutions are needed, but their evaluation under realistic reusable context scenarios remains a challenge. Current methods focus on single-turn benchmarks which cannot fully reflect real world scenarios with shared context and multiple rounds of conversations or interactions. This leads to inaccurate model evaluations. Specifically, sub-O(n) methods struggle in handling shared context scenarios where O(n) memory is necessary to preserve all essential information for different queries. 

This paper introduces SCBench, a new benchmark designed to tackle these limitations. SCBench evaluates models on shared-context scenarios and multi-turn interactions, using two common context reuse patterns. It features 12 tasks assessing four key capabilities: string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information processing, and multi-tasking. SCBench's design offers a more realistic evaluation of long-context models, reflecting real-world application scenarios. Testing eight LLMs and 13 long-context methods, including a novel method called Tri-shape, it reveals that O(n) memory with sub-O(n^2) pre-filling calculation is critical for robust multi-turn performance, while dynamic sparse attention methods show higher efficiency and effectiveness than static sparse methods.

### In-depth insights


#### KV Cache Focus
The paper lacks a dedicated "KV Cache Focus" heading, but KV cache optimization is central.  It introduces SCBench, a benchmark evaluating long-context LLM performance through a **KV cache-centric lens**.  SCBench assesses KV cache generation, compression, retrieval, and loading, vital for efficient long-context inference.  This focus highlights the often-overlooked challenge of **KV cache reuse in multi-turn/request scenarios**, unlike prior single-request benchmarks.  **SCBench exposes weaknesses in existing methods**, particularly sub-O(n) memory approaches, which struggle in multi-turn settings.  It underscores the need for efficient encoding and robust retrieval strategies to maintain performance with extended contexts.  By focusing on KV cache, SCBench provides a valuable framework for understanding and improving long-context LLM performance in real-world applications.

#### SCBench Intro
**SCBench introduces a novel evaluation framework for long-context LLMs**, shifting from single-request benchmarks to **multi-round/request scenarios** mimicking real-world usage, where **KV cache reuse is crucial**. This addresses the limitations of prior benchmarks which neglect real-world cache behavior, impacting accurate long-context method evaluation.  SCBench's **KV cache-centric approach** analyzes four key stages: generation, compression, retrieval, and loading, providing a holistic evaluation across diverse tasks like retrieval, QA, and summarization.  This comprehensive analysis unveils **critical insights** into **memory efficiency**,  **impact of query awareness in shared context**, and the dynamic interplay of **sparse attention** in encoding vs. decoding phases, ultimately guiding more robust and efficient long-context LLM development.

#### LongCtx Analysis
**SCBENCH** introduces shared-context, multi-round benchmarks evaluating the full KV cache lifecycle (generation, compression, retrieval, loading). Findings reveal **sub-O(n) memory methods struggle in multi-turn scenarios** due to the importance distribution shift of KV states with varying queries. Sparse encoding with O(n) memory performs robustly, especially with dynamic sparsity. Hybrid architectures show potential with layer-level sparsity. Different tasks exhibit varying compressibility. Prompt compression aids ICL but hinders retrieval. Overall, **SCBENCH provides crucial insights into KV cache behavior for realistic long-context LLM evaluation and development.**

#### Perf. Insights
**SCBench**, focusing on KV cache reuse, reveals **sub-O(n) methods struggle in multi-turn scenarios**, especially in complex retrieval tasks.  **Sparse encoding with O(n) memory** performs robustly but requires further sophistication in sparse patterns.  **Dynamic sparsity** methods, like MInference, show promise by adapting better to shifting context importance across turns.  Hybrid SSM-attention models offer potential but underperform in SCBench's shared context modes, suggesting improvement is needed for complex, multi-turn settings. **KV Cache compression techniques show limited benefits** in shared scenarios. **Prompt compression methods are effective for some global tasks**, but weak in others.   **Attention distribution shift in long-generation scenarios** adds complexity, emphasizing the need to handle OOD data.  Overall, **SCBench highlights that balancing efficiency and multi-turn performance remains a key challenge** for long-context LLM architectures.

#### SharedCtx Future
Shared context scenarios represent a pivotal shift in LLM interaction paradigms, transitioning from isolated queries to continuous, context-rich exchanges. This shift necessitates reevaluating existing long-context methods and benchmarks. Benchmarks should **prioritize multi-turn and multi-request settings** to reflect real-world usage patterns where context reuse dominates.  Optimizing for **dynamic context adaptation** is crucial, as attention distributions shift across queries. This necessitates exploring advanced sparse attention mechanisms that can dynamically capture critical context elements.  Beyond computational efficiency, maintaining **instruction-following capabilities** in shared context remains paramount.  Future research should also explore **heterogeneous context integration**, where diverse data modalities are dynamically loaded and processed. This holistic approach will shape the next generation of robust and adaptable long-context LLMs.

> üîº The figure shows two shared context modes used for evaluating long-context language models: Multi-turn Mode and Hinted KV Cache Multi-request Mode. In Multi-turn Mode (1), the KV cache generated from previous turns within the *same session* is reused for subsequent turns.  Each turn involves a query (Q) and answer (A) pair, and the LLM stores information from previous turns (Q1, A1, Q2, A2‚Ä¶) in the KV cache. This mode simulates a conversational setting.  The Hinted KV Cache Multi-request Mode (2) allows for KV cache reuse across multiple requests, potentially even across different users or sessions. A 'hinted' KV cache from a previous request is provided as input, alongside the new request. This mode emulates scenarios like code repository access where multiple users interact with a shared context. Both modes assess an LLM's ability to leverage and access information stored in the KV cache to efficiently respond to subsequent queries or requests within and across contexts.

> üîº This figure, located in the 'Experiments & Results' section, illustrates how various long-context methods perform when handling multiple requests involving a shared context. Specifically, it shows the accuracy of these methods on a set of tasks designed to test their ability to retrieve and utilize information from a lengthy input.  The x-axis represents the number of requests made, while the y-axis represents the accuracy achieved. Different lines represent different long-context methods, categorized by their memory usage during decoding (either O(n) or sub-O(n)). The key takeaway is that methods with O(n) memory usage show improving performance as the number of requests increases, whereas methods with sub-O(n) memory only perform well on the initial request but struggle with subsequent ones. This highlights the importance of memory capacity in handling multiple requests that rely on a shared context.

> üîº This figure evaluates the performance of various long-context methods on SCBench with varying compression rates using the Llama-3.1-8B model as a base. Compression rate refers to the ratio between the size of the compressed KV cache and the original one. The x-axis of the plot is the compression rate, and the y-axis is the average accuracy across all SCBench tasks under the multi-request setting.  Each line in the graph corresponds to one specific long-context method with varying compression rates, illustrating how performance changes with memory reduction. Lower compression rates signify higher memory savings but potentially larger performance drops, highlighting the trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness. The observation is that most methods can maintain reasonable performance when the compression rates are above 1/4, as the context can still be captured even with a certain level of compression or sparsity.  However, as the compression rate grows larger, the model will lack important information or connectivity for proper generation, which explains the substantial performance degradation for all the approaches at a 1/8 compression rate or lower.

> üîº This table presents the average performance of various long-context methods, evaluated across different base large language models (LLMs).  The evaluation uses SCBench, a new benchmark designed to assess performance in scenarios involving shared context and multiple rounds or requests.  These scenarios are common in real-world applications, where the same context (e.g., a conversation history) is reused across multiple interactions. The table is divided based on two 'shared context modes': Multi-turn Mode, where the context is cached within a single session (like a continuous conversation), and Multi-request Mode, where the context is cached across multiple sessions (like different users interacting with the same information source).  The metrics reported are average performance scores across various tasks within SCBench, covering string retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information processing, and multi-tasking capabilities of LLMs. The table also includes a compression rate (œÑ), indicating the level of context compression applied by certain methods.

The comparison focuses on several key aspects: the types of long-context capabilities assessed by each benchmark (precise retrieval, semantic retrieval, global information processing, and multi-tasking), the types of requests considered (single question, multi-turn, and multi-request), and whether the benchmark's implementation involves reusing the key-value cache, a crucial aspect for efficient handling of long contexts.
