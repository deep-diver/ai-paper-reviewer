### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Existing visual diffusion models excel but are limited by training resolution, hindering high-fidelity image/video generation. Tuning-free methods, while promising, often result in quality issues and repetitive patterns.  The primary challenge lies in increased high-frequency information when generating content exceeding training resolution, causing errors and undesirable patterns. Current solutions, while mitigating some issues, often introduce new problems like small object repetitions or unnatural colors and textures. Thus, the need for a robust tuning-free paradigm for higher-resolution visual generation remains critical. FreeScale, a tuning-free method, allows pre-trained models to generate high-resolution content via scale fusion. It processes information from different receptive scales, fusing them by extracting desired frequency components.  This maintains overall structural rationality and local object quality. Integrated smoothly into self-attention layers, it adds minimal time overhead. This approach is validated on image and video models, extending resolution up to 8k for images, marking a first.  It shows superior performance in quality and inference time compared to existing best-performing methods.

### In-depth insights


#### Resolution Limits
**Resolution limits** in current diffusion models primarily stem from training data limitations and computational constraints.  While models excel at generating lower resolution outputs, extending to higher resolutions often **introduces quality degradation**, like repetitive patterns or blurry details. This limitation arises from the **model's receptive field** and the information it can process. Upscaling methods partially address this by introducing a cascaded approach and fusing multi-scale information, but they still rely on the base model's knowledge, and there are inherent limits to how far resolution can be pushed without distorting content. Future research must focus on improving the model's ability to handle high-frequency details at scale.

#### Scale Fusion
**Scale Fusion** is a key innovation for enhancing resolution in visual generation.  It addresses limitations of previous methods like local repetitions in ScaleCrafter and small object repetitions in DemoFusion. By combining information from both **global** and **local receptive scales**, Scale Fusion refines details while maintaining structural coherence. The method extracts **desired frequency components**, fusing high-frequency details from global attention with low-frequency semantics from local attention. Notably, this fusion is within the self-attention layer, minimizing computational overhead. This approach allows FreeScale to generate higher resolution images with better quality.

#### Tuning-Free Upscaling
**Tuning-free upscaling** methods for diffusion models aim to generate high-resolution images or videos without retraining.  Existing techniques encounter challenges such as **repetitive patterns and distortions**.  Addressing these issues requires innovative approaches like **scale fusion**, which combines information from different receptive fields. Methods like **FreeScale** address these limitations by extracting and combining frequency components, enabling high-fidelity generation of details without compromising overall structure. This approach allows leveraging pre-trained models to generate content at resolutions far exceeding their original training data, pushing the boundaries of image and video synthesis.  Future work involves extending these capabilities to newer architectures and even higher resolutions.

#### 8K Image Gen.
**FreeScale** pushes image generation boundaries, achieving **unprecedented 8K resolution**.  It leverages a novel **scale fusion** method, combining global and local information to enhance details without structural compromise or object repetition.  This surpasses existing methods like ScaleCrafter and DemoFusion, which struggle with local or small-object repetitions. While computationally intensive, FreeScale offers **flexible detail control**, allowing targeted enhancements.  It remains limited by base model knowledge and primarily supports UNet architectures, but opens doors for future ultra-high-resolution content creation.

#### Detail Control
**Detail control** in image generation is crucial for achieving high fidelity and realism, especially at higher resolutions.  Fine-grained control over details allows for the creation of intricate textures, patterns, and sharp features, enhancing the overall visual appeal.  However, achieving precise detail control presents several challenges.  Balancing global coherence with local details is essential to avoid artifacts and inconsistencies.  Overemphasis on details can lead to noise and artifacts, while neglecting them results in blurry or unrealistic outputs.  Therefore, sophisticated techniques are required to effectively manage details, preserving **structural integrity** while enhancing visual richness.  Adaptive methods that vary detail levels based on image content or semantic regions can further enhance realism and artistic control. Efficient implementation of these techniques is also critical for practical applications, particularly when dealing with high-resolution images and videos.

> üîº FreeScale enhances resolution of diffusion models via a two-step process: 1) Tailored Self-Cascade Upscaling: Initial denoising at training resolution, followed by upscaling and adding noise to higher-resolution latent, refined with restrained dilated convolution and region-aware detail control. 2) Scale Fusion: Combining global and local attention, Gaussian blur fuses details from global attention with semantics from local attention, producing the final self-attention output.

> Figure 2:  Overall framework of FreeScale. (a) Tailored Self-Cascade Upscaling. FreeScale starts with pure Gaussian noise and progressively denoises it using the training resolution. An image is then generated via the VAE decoder, followed by upscaling to obtain a higher-resolution one. We gradually add noise to the latent of this higher-resolution image and incorporate this forward noise into the denoising process of the higher-resolution latent with the use of restrained dilated convolution. Additionally, for intermediate latent steps, we enhance high-frequency details by applying region-aware detail control using masks derived from the image. (b) Scale Fusion. During denoising, we adapt the self-attention layer to a global and local attention structure. By utilizing Gaussian blur, we fuse high-frequency details from global attention and low-frequency semantics from local attention, serving as the final output of the self-attention layer.

> üîº This figure showcases the impact of FreeScale's flexible detail control on generated images. By adjusting coefficient weights assigned to specific regions within an image during generation, users can enhance or diminish the prominence of details in those areas.  Specifically, in this example, increasing the coefficient weight on the Griffons and decreasing it elsewhere yields a superior visual result with more pronounced details on the creatures and a less detailed background.  This demonstrates the granularity of control offered by FreeScale for tailoring generated image outputs.
