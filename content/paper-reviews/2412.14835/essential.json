Existing methods like outcome reward models provide sparse feedback, while manual annotation for process reward models is costly and limits scalability.  Beam search, commonly used for sampling reasoning paths, often lacks diversity and reliability, especially in the multimodal context where input misalignment frequently occurs. \nThe proposed AR-MCTS framework leverages **active retrieval** to dynamically gather relevant information for each reasoning step, addressing the limitations of beam search.  By integrating **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**, AR-MCTS automatically generates step-wise annotations and uses a **process reward model** for verification.  Experimental results on various benchmarks show that AR-MCTS significantly enhances the performance of different MLLMs, improving both the accuracy and diversity of reasoning paths.  The results highlight the effectiveness of the active retrieval strategy and demonstrate the framework's potential for reliable and efficient automated multimodal reasoning.", "affiliation": "Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2412.14835/podcast.wav"}
