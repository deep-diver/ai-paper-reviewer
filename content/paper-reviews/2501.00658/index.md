### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

State Space Models (SSMs), while promising for long-sequence processing, suffer from two key limitations: a strong recency bias, where the model prioritizes recent information, and over-smoothing, where deeper networks lose the ability to distinguish between tokens.  These limitations hinder the model's ability to recall distant information and make them vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 

The researchers propose a novel "polarization" technique.  This involves modifying the state transition matrices within the SSM to create two separate channels; one designed to preserve historical context and the other to suppress excessive smoothing.  Experiments demonstrate that this technique consistently improves recall accuracy for long-range information, and it enables SSMs to benefit more significantly from deeper network architectures, thus overcoming the inherent limitations.

> üîº The figure visualizes the relationship between the logarithmic influence scores (log|‚àÇyt/‚àÇxs|) and the relative distance (t-s) between tokens in a sequence processed by a state space model (SSM).  The influence score quantifies how much a given input token (xs) impacts a specific output token (yt). The plot shows how this influence decays exponentially with distance, illustrating the recency bias inherent in SSMs.  Different lines represent different pre-trained SSM models (with varying sizes), and all show a consistent linear decay rate. This suggests the recency bias in SSMs is a property of the model architecture rather than merely a reflection of data statistics.

### In-depth insights


#### SSM Recency Bias
The concept of "SSM Recency Bias" highlights a critical limitation of Structured State Space Models (SSMs) in handling long-range dependencies within sequences.  **SSMs, while theoretically capable of capturing long-range information, exhibit a strong tendency to prioritize recent information over earlier context.** This bias manifests as an exponential decay in the influence of earlier tokens on later predictions, hindering the model's ability to effectively recall distant information. The paper reveals that this recency bias stems from the inherent mathematical properties of SSMs and not merely from data limitations or model architecture choices.  **This recency is further amplified by the design and parameterization choices commonly used in practice.**  This bias negatively impacts the model's robustness, making it susceptible to adversarial attacks targeting the manipulation of earlier less influential tokens.  Therefore, understanding and mitigating this inherent bias is crucial for improving SSMs' ability to fully exploit long sequences, enhancing their performance and addressing security concerns.

#### Over-smoothing Issue
The over-smoothing issue, as discussed in the context of state-space models (SSMs), describes the phenomenon where, as SSMs increase in depth, token representations become increasingly indistinguishable.  This is a critical limitation because it hinders the SSM's ability to effectively represent and utilize long-range dependencies. The core problem is that **SSMs act as smoothing operators**, progressively blurring distinctions between tokens.  This effect is exacerbated in deeper models leading to a performance plateau and eventual decline in performance.  The paper highlights that the fundamental dilemma between **recency bias and over-smoothing** is a major obstacle to scaling SSMs. The over-smoothing effect is directly linked to the nature of the state transition matrices and the recurrent updates. The proposed solution, polarization, aims to tackle both issues simultaneously by introducing carefully chosen fixed values in the state transition matrices to control the degree of smoothing and retain memory information effectively.

#### Polarization Method
The proposed "Polarization Method" addresses the inherent limitations of Structured State Space Models (SSM) by directly tackling their **recency bias** and **over-smoothing** tendencies.  The core idea is to strategically modify the state transition matrices of the SSM.  Specifically, it involves polarizing two channels within these matrices, forcing one channel to always retain past information (by setting its values to 1) and another to only focus on the current token (by setting its values to 0). This dual-channel approach cleverly balances the model's ability to learn from long-range dependencies (via the persistent channel) and prevents the complete loss of fine-grained, recent details (via the zeroed-out channel).  **This avoids the inherent trade-off between capturing long-range contexts and maintaining sensitivity to recent inputs**, a significant limitation found in other SSM architectures. The method's effectiveness is empirically demonstrated through improved recall accuracy in long-range association tasks, showcasing its potential for enhancing the performance of SSMs and making them more robust and less susceptible to adversarial attacks.

#### Depth Scaling Limits
The concept of "Depth Scaling Limits" in the context of state space models (SSMs) for sequence processing highlights a critical trade-off between model capacity and performance.  While increasing the depth of SSMs initially improves the ability to capture long-range dependencies, this improvement plateaus and eventually reverses at a certain depth. **This limitation stems from the inherent smoothing nature of SSMs**, where token representations become increasingly similar as the depth increases, leading to a phenomenon known as over-smoothing.  This over-smoothing effect diminishes the discriminative power of the model, hindering its ability to distinguish between meaningful and irrelevant information in long sequences.  The depth at which the over-smoothing effect dominates depends on factors such as the context length of the input sequences and the specific SSM architecture.  Therefore, **optimizing the depth of SSMs requires careful consideration of the specific application and dataset**, aiming for a balance between sufficient capacity to capture long-range interactions and preventing the detrimental effects of over-smoothing.  Furthermore, techniques to mitigate over-smoothing, such as the proposed polarization method, may be crucial for effectively scaling SSM depth and unlocking their full potential in modeling complex sequences.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this paper could explore several promising avenues.  **Extending the polarization technique** to other SSM architectures beyond Mamba, and rigorously evaluating its effectiveness across diverse tasks and datasets is crucial. Investigating the **interaction between polarization and other SSM design choices**, like the selection mechanism or the type of activation functions, would provide a deeper understanding of its impact on model performance.  Further theoretical analysis could focus on **generalizing the over-smoothing and recency bias theorems** to a wider class of SSMs and even other sequence models to uncover more universal principles governing sequence processing.  **Developing more sophisticated methods for mitigating over-smoothing**, beyond simple polarization, could involve exploring alternative state space transformations or incorporating attention mechanisms selectively to control information flow.  Finally, empirical studies examining the **robustness of polarized SSMs against various adversarial attacks** and their potential for improved generalization in low-resource settings would significantly increase our confidence in the proposed solution's practical applicability.

The benchmark involves embedding a statement within a long document and assessing the model's ability to retrieve that statement. The left heatmap shows the results for the Mamba-Codestral-7B SSM, while the right heatmap shows the results for the Mistral-7B Transformer model.  The heatmaps illustrate retrieval accuracy across different document lengths ('full context length') and statement positions within the document ('needle position').  The results reveal a recency bias in the SSM, where accuracy is higher when the statement is closer to the end of the document. The Transformer model shows more consistent performance regardless of statement position.

The target class for these attacks was 'horse'. Two attack scenarios were tested, each with different ratios of corrupted data: (a) 25% and (b) 47%. The attacks involved replacing pixels in either the beginning or end of the image sequences with pixels from images of the target class.  The success rate of the attack (how often the model misclassified a non-horse image as a horse) is shown for four models: H3, Mamba, RWKV and the Transformer baseline.

> üîº Table 5 expands on the results presented in Table 5 of the paper by examining the effects of different configurations on locality and over-smoothing in the context of associative recall.  It shows that a combination of 1-polarization (setting one channel of the state transition matrix to 1) and 0-polarization (setting another channel to 0) significantly mitigates locality issues, while deepening the architecture primarily helps reduce recency bias without worsening over-smoothing.  Importantly, 0-polarization alone effectively reduces over-smoothing, enabling improved performance gains from increased depth.

> Table 5: Extension to Tab. 5. We note the extent of locality and over-smoothing for each configuration. We consider 1111-polarization mitigates locality most significantly, while deepening architecture only relieves recency mildly but deteriorates over-smoothing. 00-polarization alleviates over-smoothening and unleash the benefits by depth scaling.
