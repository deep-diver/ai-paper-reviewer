Existing hybrid models sharing layers have limitations, like fixed structure and order, hindering exploration. This paper recognizes the complimentary nature between Transformers and Mamba, paving the way for a unified architecture to leverage both of their strengths.\n\nTo address these limitations, the paper introduces **TransMamba**, a novel framework unifying Transformers and Mamba. It dynamically switches between attention and state space mechanisms using shared parameters. A memory converter bridges the gap between the two, ensuring seamless information flow. The flexible TransPoint scheduling optimizes the use of each structure and contributes to better performance and efficiency. Extensive experiments confirm TransMamba's efficacy and consistency.", "affiliation": "Tencent Hunyuan", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.24067/podcast.wav"}
