### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for complex reasoning tasks, but existing serving systems are inefficient due to the high and varying computational costs.  These systems fail to adapt to the scaling behaviors of reasoning algorithms or the varying difficulty of queries, leading to inefficient resource utilization and unmet latency targets.  This results in wasted compute, degraded accuracy, and missed latency targets. 



To address this, the researchers developed Dynasor, a novel system that optimizes compute allocation for LLM reasoning.  Dynasor uses a new metric called 'certaindex' to dynamically track reasoning progress.  Based on certaindex, Dynasor adapts compute allocation: more for difficult queries, less for easier ones, and early termination for unpromising queries.  **This approach significantly reduces compute usage (up to 50% in batch processing) while maintaining accuracy and improving latency (up to 4.7x tighter latency SLOs in online serving).**

> üîº Figure 1(a) shows the inference time scaling of the self-consistency algorithm on the GSM8K benchmark dataset.  The x-axis represents the number of output tokens, which is a proxy for the amount of computation used. The y-axis shows the overall accuracy achieved.  The curve demonstrates the typical trade-off in LLM reasoning algorithms: increasing computation (more tokens) generally leads to higher accuracy, up to a point where further increases yield diminishing returns. The figure highlights the existence of three zones: an easy zone where a small amount of computation is sufficient for high accuracy; a scaling zone where increasing computation significantly improves accuracy; and an impossible zone where no amount of computation can guarantee a correct solution.

### In-depth insights


#### Adaptive Compute
Adaptive compute in the context of large language models (LLMs) focuses on dynamically adjusting the computational resources allocated to individual reasoning tasks based on their inherent difficulty and progress.  **This contrasts with traditional approaches that use a fixed compute budget per task, leading to inefficiency.**  A key aspect is the development of a proxy metric, often termed "certaindex," which quantifies the LLM's confidence in approaching a solution.  This allows the system to intelligently allocate more compute to challenging problems where confidence is low and to curtail resources for those nearing completion or showing high certainty.  **Early termination of unpromising tasks is another crucial element**  ‚Äì preventing wasted resources on queries that are unlikely to yield accurate results. The efficacy of adaptive compute hinges on accurate and efficient measurement of progress, which should ideally be computationally inexpensive and compatible with diverse reasoning algorithms.  **The ultimate goal is to optimize for overall system throughput and efficiency while maintaining accuracy and fairness across multiple concurrently running tasks.**  Achieving this requires sophisticated scheduling mechanisms capable of dynamically allocating resources in response to evolving certaindex values.

#### Certaindex Metric
The core idea behind the "Certaindex Metric" is to quantify the confidence of a large language model (LLM) in its reasoning process.  **It serves as a proxy for measuring reasoning progress**, enabling dynamic resource allocation during inference.  Instead of uniformly allocating compute resources, this metric allows for adaptive resource management.  **Higher Certaindex values indicate that the model is more confident in its current answer, suggesting less compute is needed.** Conversely, low values signal uncertainty, prompting further exploration and the allocation of additional resources.  The beauty of Certaindex lies in its generality; its measurement can be adapted across diverse reasoning algorithms, acting as a unified interface between the LLM and the system.  **This adaptability is crucial for efficiently serving various reasoning tasks**, as it avoids the need for algorithm-specific resource allocation strategies, simplifying system design and improving resource utilization.  However, the effective use of Certaindex depends on **accurate calibration of thresholds**.  Finding optimal thresholds is essential to balance the cost of computation with accuracy and performance, necessitating calibration procedures using empirical data or profiling mechanisms.

#### Dynasor System
The Dynasor system is presented as a novel, end-to-end LLM serving system designed to efficiently manage inference-time compute for dynamic reasoning programs.  Its core innovation lies in the use of **certaindex**, a proxy metric quantifying the LLM's confidence in its reasoning process.  Unlike traditional systems that operate at the level of individual input/output requests, Dynasor understands and orchestrates the scheduling of requests within the context of entire reasoning queries. This allows Dynasor to adapt compute allocation dynamically, providing more resources to challenging queries, reducing compute for simpler ones, and terminating unpromising queries early.  This adaptive approach aims to optimize the balance between accuracy, latency, and cost. The system's architecture includes a reasoning program abstraction, a certaindex-based intra-program scheduler, and a program-aware inter-program scheduler, working in concert to achieve efficient resource allocation and task scheduling.  **Dynasor's effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive evaluations showing significant improvements in compute usage, latency, and throughput compared to state-of-the-art systems.** The system's design is shown to be adaptable to a variety of reasoning algorithms and LLMs, highlighting its potential for broad applicability in serving future LLM reasoning applications.

#### Empirical Studies
An Empirical Studies section in a research paper would rigorously evaluate the proposed approach, likely called Dynasor.  It would present controlled experiments demonstrating **Dynasor's effectiveness** across various scenarios.  Key metrics to be analyzed would include **compute resource usage (token count or GPU time), accuracy, latency, and throughput**. The experiments would compare Dynasor against relevant baselines, such as traditional serving systems or other scheduling algorithms, under different conditions. For example, varying the difficulty of tasks or the number of concurrent requests, to explore Dynasor's adaptability.  **Statistical significance** would be crucial in establishing whether performance improvements are genuine. The section would ideally include detailed breakdowns of results, providing insights into the contributions of Dynasor's various components, such as gang-scheduling, certaindex-based allocation, and the use of various heuristics.  Furthermore, ablation studies should be included to assess the impact of removing individual parts of Dynasor to understand their independent contributions.  Ultimately, a strong Empirical Studies section would provide compelling evidence to support the claims made in the paper.

#### Future Work
Future research directions stemming from this work on efficiently serving LLM reasoning programs could explore several key areas.  **Extending Dynasor's adaptive scheduling capabilities to handle a broader range of reasoning algorithms and LLM architectures** is crucial.  Further investigation into the properties of *certaindex* across different LLMs and tasks is warranted, potentially leading to more robust and generalizable methods for estimating reasoning progress.  **Developing more sophisticated resource allocation strategies beyond simple thresholding and curve fitting** is a key area; reinforcement learning or other advanced techniques could be leveraged for optimal dynamic resource allocation.  **Incorporating fairness considerations beyond finish-time fairness** to address potential biases in resource allocation among different users or queries is essential. Finally, **thorough empirical evaluations on larger-scale datasets and more diverse deployment scenarios** are critical to validate Dynasor's effectiveness and robustness in real-world production environments.

It highlights the inefficiency of existing systems in allocating resources across tasks of varying difficulty.  Existing systems often allocate resources evenly, leading to under-allocation for harder tasks (requiring more compute to get the correct answer) and over-allocation for easier tasks (using more compute than necessary). The ideal allocation strategy dynamically adjusts resource allocation based on the difficulty of each query to optimize for accuracy, cost, and latency.

The results are shown across two different tasks and models. The x-axis represents the number of generated tokens (compute), while the y-axis shows the achieved accuracy.  This visualization demonstrates the superior performance of Dynasor's certaindex method, achieving higher accuracy with fewer tokens than the other two methods.

> üîº This figure illustrates the fairness of Dynasor's scheduling mechanism by comparing the ratio of latency to the number of tokens used.  The baseline token count represents the number of tokens consumed when all programs utilize their maximum resources. The graph shows that Dynasor with both gang scheduling and the shortest job first (SJF) scheduling algorithm improves finish-time fairness significantly compared to the baseline, particularly for longer tasks.

> üîº This figure demonstrates the effectiveness of Dynasor in optimizing the performance of the Qwen-QWQ language model.  The original Qwen-QWQ model, due to its long chain-of-thought generation process, performs poorly under lower token limits, often failing to reach conclusions.  Dynasor addresses this by implementing two strategies:  'QWQ Guided' breaks the generation into smaller chunks with intermediate 'final answer' prompts to improve the accuracy and reduce token consumption. 'QWQ Cut' adds a certaindex-based termination condition, allowing early termination of unpromising generations. This results in significant reduction of tokens, while maintaining accuracy comparable to the original model, demonstrating that Dynasor is capable of adapting to diverse LLMs and improving their efficiency.

> üîº This table compares the token consumption of various scheduling strategies for two different reasoning tasks: self-consistency on the MATH dataset and Monte Carlo Tree Search on the ASDiv dataset.  It shows the token usage under different methods: the baseline (no optimization), a static threshold approach (Dynasor's core method), a refined approach combining initial step curve fitting, a 5-step threshold approach, a single-step threshold approach, and a dynamic curve fitting approach.  The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of Dynasor's fine-grained resource allocation compared to simpler scheduling approaches, while maintaining the same level of accuracy for each method.
