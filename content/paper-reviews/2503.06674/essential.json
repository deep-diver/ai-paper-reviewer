Existing methods based on distribution matching or trajectory matching face limitations: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching yields suboptimal image quality.  Few-step generation strikes a better balance between speed and image quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off. To improve the current SOTA, this paper proposes learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching. \n\nThe paper introduces Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a novel framework combining trajectory distillation and distribution matching. TDM aligns the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level using a data-free score distillation objective. It supports deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation. TDM outperforms existing methods on backbones like SDXL and PixArt-a.  Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench.", "affiliation": "Hong Kong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.06674/podcast.wav"}
