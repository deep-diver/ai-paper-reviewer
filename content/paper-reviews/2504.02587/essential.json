{"importance": "This paper is important because it **addresses the critical need for reproducibility** in vision-language RL research. By providing a transparent framework and evaluation scheme, it enables **more robust and comparable studies**. It facilitates **broader engagement** and potentially leading to faster progress in this rapidly evolving field.", "summary": "A transparent RL framework (MAYE) for vision language models with a standardized evaluation scheme, promoting reproducibility and deeper insights.", "takeaways": ["MAYE framework provides a transparent, from-scratch implementation of RL for VLMs, enhancing reproducibility.", "The study uncovers key empirical findings, including the sensitivity of response length to random seeds and the correlation between reflection and output length.", "RL consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning in generalization, even with high-quality data."], "tldr": "Reinforcement Learning shows promise in improving Vision Language Models. However, existing RL applications in VLMs often face issues with reproducibility due to heavily engineered frameworks and lack standardized evaluation protocols. This makes comparing results and understanding training dynamics difficult, creating a gap for researchers not deeply familiar with both RL and VLMs. \n\nTo address these challenges, this paper introduces MAYE, a transparent framework for RL in VLMs with a minimal pipeline validated across models/datasets. It enables better comprehension and customization. A standardized evaluation scheme assesses training dynamics and reflective behaviors. Experiments reveal insights: response length is sensitive to seeds, reflection correlates with length, and RL generalizes better than SFT.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.02587/podcast.wav"}
