Human motion, similar to that of robots, involves planning the \u201dend-effector\u201d (EE), typically the hands, towards the target position. The rest of the body then cooperates accordingly with the EE, abiding by inverse kinematics principles.", "description": "This figure illustrates the core concept of the proposed method.  It draws an analogy between human movement and robotic control.  In robotics, the \"end-effector\" (EE), often a hand or tool at the end of a robotic arm, is the part that interacts directly with the environment. The robot's control system plans the EE's movements first, and the rest of the robot's body adapts accordingly through inverse kinematics (IK).  The authors propose a similar approach for generating human videos:  they focus on generating hand movements (EE) first, directly from the audio input, and then use a diffusion model to generate the rest of the body's movements, ensuring synchronization with the hand gestures. The hand poses serve as a guiding signal, simplifying the generation process and improving naturalness.", "section": "1.

Hand masks that mask out invisible hands frames are directly added on noisy motion latent.", "description": "This figure illustrates the architecture of Stage 1 in the proposed two-stage framework for audio-driven gesture generation.  The core is built using several Diffusion Transformers (DiT) blocks. Audio embeddings are integrated through cross-attention mechanisms, allowing the model to incorporate audio information into the generation process. Style and speed embeddings are added at each timestep, allowing control over the generated motion style and speed.  To maintain smooth transitions between frames, the previous motion latent sequence is concatenated with the current noisy motion sequence. Finally, hand masks are incorporated to handle cases where hands are not visible in the training data, ensuring more robust and accurate hand pose generation.", "section": "3.2 Preliminaries"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.10687/extracted/6139890/pics/pipeline_stage2.png", "caption": "Figure 3: \nThe overview of the Stage 2 video generation pipeline, which is based on the Parallel Reference Network structure.
