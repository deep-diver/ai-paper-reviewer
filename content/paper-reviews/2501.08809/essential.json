{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses a critical gap in AI-generated music: **controllability and quality**.  It introduces a novel framework and dataset that will likely **advance research** in symbolic music generation, enabling the creation of more sophisticated and emotionally expressive music. The multi-modal approach and the large-scale dataset also provide valuable resources for researchers in related areas.  This work could **spur innovations** in interactive music systems, virtual reality, and game design.", "summary": "XMusic: A new framework generates high-quality, emotionally controllable symbolic music from various prompts (images, videos, text, tags, humming).", "takeaways": ["XMusic, a generalized and controllable symbolic music generation framework, is proposed.", "XMusic utilizes multi-modal prompts (images, videos, text, tags, and humming) and a novel projection space to generate high-quality symbolic music.", "XMIDI, a large-scale symbolic music dataset with 108,023 MIDI files annotated with precise emotion and genre labels, is created."], "tldr": "Current AI music generation struggles with controlling musical emotions and ensuring high-quality output.  This research tackles these challenges by introducing XMusic, a novel framework for symbolic music generation.  Existing methods often lack flexibility in input types and struggle with consistent output quality. \n\nXMusic uses a two-part system.  The first, XProjector, translates diverse input prompts (images, video, text, etc.) into symbolic musical elements such as genre, emotion, rhythm, and notes.  The second part, XComposer, generates music based on these elements using a transformer network, and a selector identifies the highest-quality results via multi-task learning. The framework also includes XMIDI, a large, high-quality dataset to train the system, demonstrating **significant improvements** over current state-of-the-art methods in both objective and subjective evaluations.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Speech and Audio", "sub_category": "Music Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08809/podcast.wav"}
