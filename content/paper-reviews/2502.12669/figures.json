Stage 1 involves filtering documents based on a predefined schema to select relevant publications. In Stage 2, a large language model extracts key knowledge entities and relationships from the filtered documents. Finally, Stage 3 organizes this extracted information into a structured knowledge graph stored in a graph database.  The schema integrates three ontologies: fabrication, parameters, and performance, to capture the complex relationships within perovskite solar cell research.", "section": "3 Perovskite-KG"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.12669/x1.png", "caption": "(b) The multi-agent framework for perovskite instruction tuning dataset generation.", "description": "This figure illustrates the multi-agent framework employed to generate the instruction tuning dataset for Perovskite-LLM.  Three specialized agents collaborate: an Information Extraction Agent processes raw data from various sources; a Quality Validation Agent ensures data accuracy and relevance; and a Document Summarization Agent condenses and structures the information into high-quality question-answer pairs for model training. The process integrates expert guidance to ensure both high reliability and alignment with materials science principles.

The Perovskite-KG construction pipeline consists of three stages: document filtering (using expert-defined schema and LLM), knowledge extraction (using LLMs to extract relevant information from documents), and knowledge graph organization. The multi-agent framework leverages three agents: the Information Extraction Agent, the Quality Validation Agent, and the Document Summarization Agent to generate high-quality question-answer pairs and reasoning problems. These agents work synergistically to ensure data accuracy and consistency, ultimately building the datasets that train the LLMs.", "section": "3 Perovskite-KG"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.12669/x3.png", "caption": "(a) The distribution of question categories in the instruction tuning dataset.", "description": "A pie chart illustrating the distribution of question categories within the instruction tuning dataset for Perovskite-Chat.
