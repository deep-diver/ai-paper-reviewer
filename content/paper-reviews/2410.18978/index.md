### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Framer is a new approach to video frame interpolation that lets users interactively create smooth transitions between two images. Unlike traditional methods that automatically generate transitions, Framer allows users to customize the process by dragging and manipulating keypoints on the images. This gives users more control over the final result.  The paper also introduces an "autopilot" mode that automatically estimates the keypoints and their trajectories, making it easier to use for users who don't want to manually adjust the keypoints. Experiments show Framer produces high-quality results in various applications, including image morphing, time-lapse video generation, and cartoon animation, often outperforming existing methods.  The core innovation is the blend of human interaction and a generative model, allowing for both fine-grained control and ease of use.

#### Why does it matter?
This paper is important for researchers working on video frame interpolation, generative models, and human-computer interaction.  It introduces a novel interactive approach that bridges the gap between fully automated and entirely manual methods, offering a more intuitive and controllable way to generate high-quality results. The "autopilot" mode also simplifies the process for users who prefer less interaction.  Furthermore, the integration of user-guided controls and the use of a generative model offer promising new avenues for research and development in related fields.

> Table S2: Ablations on each component, evaluating only the middle frame out of all 7 generated frames. 'w/o trajectory' denotes inference without guidance from point trajectory, 'w/o traj. updating' indicates inference without trajectory updates, and 'w/o bi' suggests trajectory updating without bi-directional consistency verification.
