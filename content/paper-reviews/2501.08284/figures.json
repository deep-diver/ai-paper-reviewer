It visually depicts the three main categories for classifying tweets: Hate, Abusive, and Neutral. Each category is further defined with examples and criteria for identification.  Additionally, it addresses instances of tweets written in other languages or those that are unintelligible, providing clear instructions for handling such cases.  The flowchart aids annotators in consistently classifying tweets based on their content and the intent behind the language used.", "section": "3 Creating AfriHate"}]
