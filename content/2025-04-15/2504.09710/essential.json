{"importance": "This paper introduces an automated curriculum learning approach, **DUMP**, for RL-based LLM post-training, addressing the critical challenge of efficiently training across diverse data distributions. By leveraging advantage-based UCB scores, it dynamically optimizes training schedules, enhancing model capabilities and accelerating convergence. This offers a practical solution for improving LLM performance and opens new avenues for research in adaptive training strategies.", "summary": "DUMP: Adaptive curriculum learning enhances RL-based LLM post-training!", "takeaways": ["Absolute advantage serves as a practical proxy for distribution-level learnability.", "DUMP leverages advantage-based UCB scores to adaptively guide training over data distributions.", "DUMP significantly improves convergence speed and final performance."], "tldr": "Modern LLM training often uses data from various distributions with different sources and complexities. Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training methods typically treat all training data as uniform, ignoring the inherent heterogeneity across distributions. This uniform treatment overlooks the potential for more efficient training by dynamically scheduling data from different distributions. It wastes resources on data where the model has already saturated its learning or that are too difficult to learn effectively.\n\nThis paper introduces **DUMP**, an automated distribution-level curriculum learning framework for RL-based LLM post-training. The core insight is that the magnitude of policy advantages reflects how much a model can still benefit from a given distribution. DUMP uses Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) to dynamically adjust sampling probabilities, prioritizing distributions with high average advantage or low sample count. Experiments on logic reasoning datasets show that DUMP improves convergence speed and final performance.", "affiliation": "Rutgers University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2504.09710/podcast.wav"}
