Current methods lack metrics for heuristic image complements, especially for overall style and detail. The cultural heritage community hesitates on using hand-coloring methods. Digital restoration offers greater tolerance for error and a broader array of solutions. It is hard for inpainting methods to restore the distinct edge structures and texture details in murals. \n\nThis paper introduces **DiffuMural**, a novel method that combines Multi-scale convergence and Collaborative Diffusion mechanism to restore damaged murals by considering spatial dynamics of damaged regions. It utilizes ControlNet and cyclic consistency loss. The method uses segmentation masks as conditional guidance, integrates multi-scale features, and employs co-diffusion for realistic integration. A human value assessment system is integrated to retain the cultural and artistic significance.", "affiliation": "Southern University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.09513/podcast.wav"}
