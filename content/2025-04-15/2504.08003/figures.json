The user first instructs the model to add 3 to any number mentioned in subsequent prompts.  Then, the user requests the generation of an image of two dolphins swimming in the ocean.  The caption highlights the model's need to interpret the number '2' in the prompt as '5' (2+3) due to the prior global instruction, before generating the image.", "section": "3.1 Prompt Construction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08003/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Examples of generated images with global instructions.", "description": "This figure showcases examples of images generated by GPT-40 following various global instructions.  These instructions are overarching directives given before the specific image generation prompt, aiming to test the model's ability to integrate and follow complex contextual information.  Examples include reversing spatial terms (e.g., 'left' meaning 'right'), modifying numerical values in prompts, and restricting output topic to certain words.  The images and their corresponding prompts illustrate the model's limitations in consistently adhering to such global constraints, sometimes ignoring them entirely in favor of literal interpretations of the immediate image generation instruction.", "section": "3.2 Experimental Results"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.08003/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Examples of image editing performed by GPT-4o.", "description": "This figure showcases examples of GPT-40's image editing capabilities.  It demonstrates both successful and unsuccessful attempts at modifying existing images based on given instructions.

The model first generates an image based on a prompt, then receives a follow-up prompt that requires it to either edit the existing image or generate a new one, conditioned on the content of the original image.  The examples highlight the model's challenges in consistently applying contextual understanding and performing multi-step logical reasoning after image generation. For instance, one example shows failure to apply an editing instruction when a condition in the instructions isn't met.", "section": "3.2 Experimental Results"}]
