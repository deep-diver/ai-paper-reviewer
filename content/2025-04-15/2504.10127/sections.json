[{"heading_title": "Task Generaliz.", "details": {"summary": "**Task generalization** is a critical challenge for GUI agents due to limited high-quality training data. The paper proposes a mid-training stage using diverse, data-rich tasks (e.g., multimodal reasoning, GUI perception). **The core idea** is to enhance general agentic abilities before fine-tuning on GUI-specific data, enabling effective knowledge transfer across domains. Experiments explore various mid-training tasks, demonstrating that tasks unrelated to GUI can generalize and help to solve complex digital tasks by yielding substantial improvements, even text-only mathematical data significantly boosts GUI web agent performance. By optimizing and curate the mixed dataset, it leads to high gains compared to individual data, thus addressing data scarcity."}}, {"heading_title": "GUI Agents: VLM", "details": {"summary": "GUI Agents leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) represent a paradigm shift in automating digital tasks. **The potential for cross-platform solutions and seamless interaction with diverse interfaces is transformative.** However, the reliance on high-quality trajectory data presents a significant bottleneck. This research addresses this limitation by strategically incorporating reasoning-intensive tasks during a dedicated mid-training phase. The core idea is to enhance the VLM's foundational capabilities, enabling better generalization to GUI planning scenarios. This approach effectively addresses the problem of scarce and expensive GUI trajectory data. It uses diverse reasoning-intensive datasets instead. **Tasks like multimodal and text based mathematical reasoning are used to enhance cross modal knowledge transfer.** It highlights how leveraging readily available data and focusing on reasoning can overcome data scarcity issues. Results demonstrate **substantial performance improvements** and underscore the benefits of cross-domain knowledge transfer for GUI agent development."}}, {"heading_title": "GUI-Mid SOTA", "details": {"summary": "**GUI-Mid SOTA** likely refers to the state-of-the-art performance achieved using the newly introduced **GUIMid** dataset for GUI-based agents.

This is especially pertinent in continual learning scenarios where models are sequentially exposed to new tasks or datasets. **Increased data volume**, while beneficial for overall performance and generalization, can inadvertently lead to **catastrophic forgetting**, where the model's accuracy on older tasks drastically declines. Several factors contribute to this phenomenon, including **limited model capacity**, **data imbalance**, and **conflicting gradient updates**. As the model adapts to new data, it may overwrite or distort the parameters that were crucial for solving previous tasks. Mitigation strategies often involve techniques like **regularization**, **knowledge distillation**, and **replay buffers** to preserve or reinforce the knowledge acquired from earlier experiences. Addressing this trade-off requires careful consideration of the data distribution, model architecture, and learning algorithm."}}]
