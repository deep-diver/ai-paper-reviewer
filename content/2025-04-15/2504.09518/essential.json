These methods depend on object proposals and struggle to connect visual data and language. In vision-language research, models such as CoCa have shown the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training. Inspired by this, the paper aims to bring powerful priors into 3D captioning to improve performance and generalization.\n\nThe study introduces **3D CoCa**, a unified framework integrating contrastive learning and caption generation for 3D scenes. It leverages a frozen CLIP vision-language backbone, a spatially-aware 3D scene encoder, and a multimodal decoder. 3D CoCa jointly optimizes contrastive and captioning objectives, eliminating external detectors. Experiments on ScanRefer and Nr3D show significant performance improvements over existing methods, demonstrating stronger spatial reasoning and semantic grounding.", "affiliation": "Shanghai University of Engineering Science", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.09518/podcast.wav"}
