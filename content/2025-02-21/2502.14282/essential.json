Current methods lack fine-grained perception and struggle with interdependent subtasks across multiple applications, hindering their ability to perform real-world instructions effectively. This paper addresses the challenge in GUI agents.\n\nThis paper proposes a hierarchical agent framework called **PC-Agent** to tackle complex tasks on PCs. PC-Agent includes an Active Perception Module (APM) for refined perception and a hierarchical multi-agent collaboration architecture that decomposes decision-making into instruction-subtask-action levels. Additionally, it introduces a reflection-based dynamic decision-making mechanism for error detection and adjustment. A new benchmark, PC-Eval, is introduced. The PC-Agent achieves a 32% improvement in task success rate.", "affiliation": "MAIS, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14282/podcast.wav"}
