[{"heading_title": "RL for Search", "details": {"summary": "**Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Search** presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Language Models (LLMs), particularly in scenarios demanding external knowledge integration. This approach addresses limitations of LLMs that primarily rely on internal knowledge. By incentivizing LLMs to **autonomously engage external search systems**, RL offers a pathway to overcome inaccuracies and hallucinations, crucial for time-sensitive and knowledge-intensive tasks. The key is to train LLMs to effectively use the search tool and integrate it into the reasoning. By carefully design the **reward function** we can progressively enable the model to invoke the external retrieval system and integrate retrieved documents into reasoning."}}, {"heading_title": "R1-Searcher", "details": {"summary": "**R1-Searcher** is presented as a novel two-stage outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) approach designed to enhance search capabilities in Large Language Models (LLMs). It addresses the challenge of LLMs relying heavily on internal knowledge, which can lead to inaccuracies, especially in time-sensitive or knowledge-intensive tasks. **The framework enables LLMs to autonomously invoke external search systems** to access additional knowledge during reasoning. A key feature is its reliance exclusively on RL, eliminating the need for process rewards or distillation for a cold start, potentially streamlining the training process and improving efficiency. **The two-stage approach likely involves an initial phase focused on learning the mechanics of external search integration**, followed by a refinement stage that optimizes the use of retrieved information for accurate problem-solving, it represents a significant step towards more deliberative reasoning in LLMs. The method significantly outperforms previous strong RAG methods."}}, {"heading_title": "Two-Stage RL", "details": {"summary": "**Two-stage RL** is a crucial strategy for complex problem-solving. It allows for a phased approach, where initial stages focus on exploration and learning basic skills, and subsequent stages refine these skills towards a specific goal. This mimics human learning, starting with broad understanding and moving towards specialized expertise. The first stage could involve pre-training, imitation learning, or unsupervised exploration to establish a foundational policy. The second stage involves finetuning with reinforcement learning, guiding the policy towards optimal performance. This approach prevents premature convergence to suboptimal policies and improves sample efficiency. The design of the reward function is critical, as it will influence the model to take certain actions based on the reward it gets. Moreover, it can be designed so that the model may consider a different reward at different stages.

By strategically inserting special tags like <begin_of_query> and <end_of_query>, the model is prompted to use the search tool during generation. When the model generates the <end_of_query> tag, the process pauses so that the query can be extracted and used for retrieval. The retrieved documents, surrounded by <begin_of_documents> and <end_of_documents> tags, are then incorporated into the model\u2019s reasoning process.  This method helps ensure that retrieval is a seamless part of the reasoning, enabling the model to make decisions based on retrieved knowledge without disrupting its flow."}}, {"heading_title": "Online Search", "details": {"summary": "**Online search** represents a crucial frontier for enhancing LLMs, moving beyond static knowledge to real-time information access. Integrating LLMs with online search capabilities holds the potential to address knowledge-intensive tasks, time-sensitive queries, and personalized information needs more effectively. **A key challenge** lies in enabling LLMs to formulate effective search queries, understand the retrieved information, and synthesize it into coherent and accurate responses. **Another challenge** is to design training methodologies that allow LLMs to effectively leverage online search without overfitting or memorizing specific search results. There is also a **need to ensure** the ethical use of online search within LLMs, mitigating the risk of biased information and promoting reliable answers."}}]
