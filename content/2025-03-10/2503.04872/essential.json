Existing methods like model distillation and transfer learning have limitations in achieving high accuracy and require careful data/domain selection, which is time-consuming and can lead to conflicting gradients during training, hindering overall learning progress. \n\nTo tackle these issues, this paper introduces the Branch-Merge distillation approach, which enhances model compression through two phases: the Branch Phase, where knowledge from a large teacher model is selectively distilled into specialized student models; and the Merge Phase, where these student models are merged to enable cross-domain knowledge transfer and improve generalization. The resulting TinyR1-32B-Preview model outperforms existing models in various benchmarks and provides a **scalable solution for creating smaller, high-performing LLMs with reduced computational cost and time**.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.04872/podcast.wav"}
