### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Large language models (LLMs) have shown that even a simple question-answering task can improve reasoning. However, single-turn tasks may be inefficient due to sparse rewards, and they do not require the LLM to learn how to respond to user feedback. This paper addresses the limitations of single-turn tasks by introducing a **multi-attempt task framework.** The model is given multiple attempts to answer a question, with feedback provided after incorrect responses. This encourages the model to refine its attempts and improve search efficiency. 



The paper presents a simple yet effective multi-attempt task that enables LLMs to learn through reinforcement learning. A standard RL is applied to the multi-attempt task on a math problem dataset. The results show that LLMs trained on this achieves higher accuracy when evaluated with more attempts on a math benchmark. This demonstrates the potential of **multi-attempt tasks for improving LLM reasoning and self-correction abilities.** The paper also shows the multi-attempt LLM outperforms its single-turn counterpart.

### In-depth insights


#### Multi-Attempt RL
Multi-Attempt Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a paradigm shift in how we train Large Language Models (LLMs). Instead of the conventional single-turn approach, **models are given multiple attempts to solve a task**, receiving feedback after each incorrect try. This encourages exploration and refinement of solutions. The core idea is to leverage the feedback signal to guide the model towards better reasoning. The multi-attempt setting enhances the model's ability to correct mistakes, refine its approach, and ultimately, improve its problem-solving skills. **This approach fosters a more robust and adaptable model**, capable of handling complex and nuanced tasks. Additionally, the multi-attempt approach facilitates a richer exploration of the solution space. By allowing the model to experiment with different strategies and learn from its failures, it can discover more effective and efficient solutions than it would in a single-turn setting. **The method mimics a more natural learning process**, akin to how humans learn through trial and error.

#### Refinement via RL
**Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be employed for refinement in language models, particularly in multi-attempt scenarios**. This approach contrasts with traditional single-turn tasks, which often suffer from sparse rewards and lack the opportunity for iterative improvement based on feedback. By allowing the model to generate multiple responses, RL enables the model to **learn how to better respond to feedback**, potentially leading to emergent capabilities. Furthermore, **RL can be used to directly refine a previous unsuccessful attempts**, as evidenced by improved performance of LLMs trained on multi-attempt tasks. This type of training may lead to broader and more efficient exploration, ultimately enhancing reinforcement learning.

#### Emergent Abilities
**Emergent abilities** in large language models refer to capabilities that arise unexpectedly as models scale in size and complexity, often without explicit training for those specific skills. This can include advanced reasoning, problem-solving, and even aspects of self-correction, as observed in models like DeepSeek R1 Zero with its 'Aha Moment' phenomenon. These abilities are crucial because they highlight the potential for LLMs to surpass simple pattern-matching and develop more general intelligence. Multi-attempt RL appears as a promising way to enhance these behaviors. It allows models not only to give answers but also learn from their mistakes.

#### Task Augmentation
**Task augmentation** is a crucial element in reinforcement learning. **Modifying the original task** can significantly improve the learning process of LLMs. Strategies involve modifying the task to a **multi-attempt** setting, enabling models to refine responses based on feedback. This involves incorporating **auxiliary tasks**, such as rewarding the model for attempting the problem and penalizing if the answer is wrong.

#### Beyond Single-Turn
Moving beyond single-turn interactions in language models signifies a shift towards more complex, multi-faceted dialogues, mirroring real-world conversations. This necessitates models capable of maintaining context, understanding user intent across multiple turns, and adapting their responses accordingly. **Multi-turn interactions enhance user experience by allowing for clarification, negotiation, and iterative problem-solving.** Reinforcement learning in such settings becomes more intricate, as the reward function must account for the long-term consequences of each response. Models must learn to balance immediate rewards with the potential for future success, requiring a more sophisticated understanding of dialogue strategy. **Evaluation metrics also need to evolve, focusing on coherence, consistency, and the overall quality of the interaction rather than just single-turn accuracy.**  Exploration becomes even more critical, as the model must discover effective dialogue paths through trial and error.  Techniques such as hierarchical reinforcement learning or imitation learning from human conversations may prove valuable in guiding exploration and improving the efficiency of learning.  **The ability to handle multi-turn interactions is crucial for deploying language models in real-world applications such as customer service, education, and personal assistance.**

> üîº This figure illustrates the core concept of the paper: a multi-attempt question answering task.  It contrasts this approach with the traditional single-turn question-answering task. The diagram shows how, in the multi-attempt scenario, the model receives feedback (whether its answer is correct or incorrect) after each attempt. If the answer is incorrect, the model is given another chance to refine its response. This process of iterative feedback and refinement is the key innovation of the paper, enabling the model to learn and improve reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning. The single-turn task, in comparison, offers only one opportunity for the model to answer and receive feedback.
