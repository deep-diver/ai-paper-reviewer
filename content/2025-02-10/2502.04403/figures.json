This framework is crucial to the paper's argument about frame-dependence, as each of these four properties is shown to be relative to the chosen frame of reference.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.04403/x2.png", "caption": "(b) Frame-Dependence", "description": "The figure illustrates that determining whether a system exhibits agency depends on the choice of reference frame.  Different choices of boundaries (what constitutes the system) and goals can lead to different conclusions about whether a system has agency, even for the same system.  The example shows how different boundaries around a thermostat will yield different understandings of its agency properties.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
