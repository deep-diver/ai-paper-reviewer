Furthermore, the identified challenges and proposed solutions concerning **privacy, security, and ethical considerations** offer essential guidelines for responsible AI development. This research opens avenues for investigating **more effective and ethical LLM deployment** in real-world applications.", "summary": "LLMs effectively attend meetings on our behalf, showcasing balanced engagement strategies in real-world scenarios, but further improvements are needed to reduce irrelevant content and transcription error tolerance.", "takeaways": ["GPT-4/40 demonstrated balanced meeting engagement, while others showed either cautious or active tendencies.", "The study highlighted the challenge of handling real-world meeting data noise and ambiguities.", "A three-phase deployment approach is proposed to incrementally enhance the AI's autonomy and responsibility while ensuring privacy and accountability."], "tldr": "Many contemporary workplaces struggle with inefficient meetings, consuming excessive time and resources. Large Language Models (LLMs) are explored as a potential solution to this problem.  The paper investigates the challenges of utilizing LLMs as meeting delegates that represent individuals, such as navigating complex conversations, dealing with ambiguities in natural language, and ensuring user privacy. \nThis research developed a prototype LLM-powered meeting delegate system and created a benchmark using real meeting transcripts.  The evaluation showed that GPT-4 maintained a balanced performance between active and cautious engagement strategies, while other LLMs exhibited varying tendencies. The study underscores the potential of LLMs as meeting delegates but also highlights the need for improvements in handling noise and ambiguities in real-world scenarios.  **A three-phase deployment strategy** is proposed to address privacy and ethical considerations.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.04376/podcast.wav"}
