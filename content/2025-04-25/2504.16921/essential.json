{"importance": "IberBench offers a **valuable resource** for LLM evaluation in Iberian languages. It helps to **drive further LLM improvement** and adaptation to languages beyond English. The benchmark's framework enables **community contributions** for broader model and dataset coverage.", "summary": "IberBench: A new benchmark to evaluate LLMs on Iberian languages, addressing data limitations and diversity gaps.", "takeaways": ["LLMs perform worse on industry-relevant tasks than fundamental ones.", "Performance is lower for Galician and Basque compared to other Iberian languages.", "The IberBench is a benchmark that enables continuous evaluation, diverse linguistic coverage, and community contributions."], "tldr": "Current LLM benchmarks fall short by focusing on English, overlooking language varieties, prioritizing NLP over industry relevance, and lacking updates. A new benchmark, **IberBench**, evaluates LLMs across Iberian languages, including Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, Basque, and Galician, and Spanish varieties in Ibero-America. IberBench integrates **101 datasets**, from tasks such as sentiment and toxicity analysis, addressing limitations by enabling continual updates and community submissions. \n\nThe team evaluated **23 LLMs** (100M to 14B parameters), highlighting their strengths and limits. The LLMs performed **worse in industry tasks** than in fundamental ones. Results for **Galician and Basque are lower**. Some tasks yielded random outputs, while others performed above random but below shared task standards. IberBench offers open-source tools for normalization, hosting, evaluation, and leaderboard access.", "affiliation": "Symanto Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2504.16921/podcast.wav"}
