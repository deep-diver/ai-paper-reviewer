Previous approaches typically optimize these factors separately, which doesn't account for the trade-off between them. Quality filtering alone can reduce diversity, while simply diversifying data might sacrifice quality. This creates a need for a unified approach that can effectively balance these competing needs to maximize LLM performance given a limited data quota. The definition of quality and diversity is usually ambiguous, leading to biases in the training data. \n\nTo combat the challenges, this paper introduces QuaDMix, a novel framework that automates the optimization of data distribution for LLM pretraining while balancing quality and diversity. QuaDMix uses multiple criteria to measure data quality and employs domain classification to gauge overall diversity. It then uses a unified data sampling function to determine the sampling probability of each data point based on quality and diversity labels. The study also uses simulated experiments on smaller models and LightGBM for efficient parameter searching. Experiments across diverse models and datasets show that QuaDMix achieves a 7.2% performance improvement across benchmarks.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.16511/podcast.wav"}
