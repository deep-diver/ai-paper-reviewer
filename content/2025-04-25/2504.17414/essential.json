This leads to inconsistencies and artifacts in the generated videos, limiting their practical use. To address this issue, researchers need novel approaches that can ensure both visual quality and temporal consistency.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel framework that uses generated animatable textured 3D meshes as explicit guidance, which allows direct reference to consistent garment texture movements throughout video sequences. It features a dynamic 3D guidance pipeline and a robust rectangular masking strategy to prevent clothing information leakage.  The authors also introduce a new high-resolution benchmark dataset with diverse clothing types and scenarios.
