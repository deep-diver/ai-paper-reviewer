However, a gap persists between open-source algorithms and closed-source models, limiting reproducibility and transparency. Existing open-source efforts are not good enough and there are issues with data scarcity and alignment. To address this gap, researchers aim to narrow this performance gap, pushing evaluation. \n\nTo address these issues, the study introduces a state-of-the-art image editing model. A data generation pipeline is designed to produce high-quality editing data. It develops GEdit-Bench, a benchmark grounded in real-world usages, for evaluation. The model adopts a Multimodal LLM and outperforms open-source baselines, approaching leading proprietary models in performance. The project name is Step1X-Edit.", "affiliation": "StepFun", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.17761/podcast.wav"}
