The traditional raster-scan order is suboptimal because it ignores image content causality. For example, in an image of a sunset, clouds are generated before the sun, even though cloud color depends on the sun. Therefore, the paper argues that learning a semantic generation order makes more sense for images. \n\nThis paper introduces a content-dependent and semantically aware generation of orders for AR patch-based image generation to improve overall generation quality. First, the model is trained with any given order, followed by self-supervised finetuning using the semantically aware orders generated by the any-order model. Experiments on two datasets show that this method produces better images than the traditional raster-scan approach, with similar training costs and no extra annotations.", "affiliation": "Stony Brook University, NY, USA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.17069/podcast.wav"}
