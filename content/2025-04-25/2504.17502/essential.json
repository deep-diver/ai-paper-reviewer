Current methods often focus on single aspects or rely on costly APIs, leading to inaccurate human judgment. Thus a robust automated evaluation for subject-driven T2I is needed.\n\nTo tackle this problem, this paper introduces **REFVNLI**, a new metric for subject-driven T2I evaluation. Trained on a large dataset using video-reasoning benchmarks and image perturbations, REFVNLI assesses both textual alignment and subject preservation. REFVNLI excels in lesser-known concepts, achieving high accuracy and alignment with human preferences. This advances the field through reliable and scalable evaluations.", "affiliation": "Google Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.17502/podcast.wav"}
