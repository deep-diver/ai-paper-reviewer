This makes it time-consuming for researchers to validate and build upon existing work. Large language models(LLMs) have shown promise in understanding and generating code, but their ability to create faithful implementations from research papers alone is uncertain.\n\nTo address this, PaperCoder, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to transform machine learning papers into functional code repositories. The framework operates in three stages: planning, analysis, and generation, using specialized agents to collaborate. Evaluations show PaperCoder creates high-quality and faithful implementations, surpassing strong baselines.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2504.17192/podcast.wav"}
