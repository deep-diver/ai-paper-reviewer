Existing video evaluations are limited to English and Western cultural contexts. To solve this issue, the paper introduces **VideoVista-CulturalLingo**. It is the first video evaluation benchmark that bridges cultural, linguistic, and domain divides in video understanding. The key areas where this benchmark differs are cultural diversity, multi-linguistics, and broad domain, and it incorporates cultures from China, North America, and Europe.The dataset has questions in Chinese and English, videos from hundreds of human-created domains. \n\nThe paper has 1,389 videos and 3,134 QA pairs, using 24 open-source or proprietary video models for evaluation. The results showed the existing models performed worse on Chinese-centric questions. Current open-source models struggle with temporal understanding. Mainstream models performed well in general science but open-source models struggled in mathematics. The paper also provides an autonomic video annotation framework harnessing the strengths of (M)LLMs.", "affiliation": "Harbin Institute of Technology, Shenzhen, China", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.17821/podcast.wav"}
