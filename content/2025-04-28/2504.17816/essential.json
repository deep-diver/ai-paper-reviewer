Current methods require extensive annotated video data which are expensive and labor-intensive. To solve this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach leveraging image customization datasets, which are more readily available. By factorizing video customization into identity injection and temporal awareness preservation, the model can learn subject-specific features without relying on video datasets, reducing computational resources. \n\nThe authors propose a method using Image-to-Video fine-tuning and stochastic switching, with the framework named the Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer, to mitigate forgetting issues. Random image token dropping and randomized image initialization are applied during fine-tuning. The study demonstrates that the method maintains strong subject consistency and scalability, and it achieves better performance than existing video customization models in zero-shot settings by using an image customization dataset, factorizing the process, and mitigating catastrophic forgetting.", "affiliation": "Seoul National University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.17816/podcast.wav"}
