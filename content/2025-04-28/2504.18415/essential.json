Existing solutions still rely on 8-bit precision, preventing full utilization of hardware. Additionally, methods like sparsification are not ideal for maximizing throughput in batched inference. Thus, there exists a need for methods that can make fully utilize 4-bit computation for 1.58-bit LLMs.\n\nThe paper introduces **BitNet v2, a novel framework enabling native 4-bit activation quantization for 1-bit LLMs**. BitNet v2 uses a module called **H-BitLinear, which applies an online Hadamard transformation prior to activation quantization to smooth sharp activation distributions**. BitNet v2 trained from scratch matches the performance of previous methods, but achieves minimal performance degradation when trained with native 4-bit activations, significantly reducing memory footprint and computational cost.", "affiliation": "University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.18415/podcast.wav"}
