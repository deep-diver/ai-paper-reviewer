Addressing this, the study introduces a unified framework that leverages 3D enhancement, aiming for precise control over both camera movement and human actions in video generation. The key issue is the lack of explicit guidance incorporating 3D-informed priors to concurrently control both camera movements and human motions.\n\nThe paper presents two main innovations: a plug-and-play module, named PCDController, trained to ensure accurate camera control using 3D point clouds, also a jointly aligned 3D world guidance method to unify control signals for both camera and human motion. The PCDController module demonstrates strong robustness in driving camera motion. This framework shows superior performance compared to existing methods in both camera controllability and human motion quality. This also includes a validation datasets for challenging camera movements and human actions.", "affiliation": "DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.14899/podcast.wav"}
