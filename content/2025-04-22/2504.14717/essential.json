Previous solutions still struggle to address challenges that include accurately tracking motion, which is difficult due to spatial distances between objects and complex scene changes. To address this problem, **TAPIP3D represents videos as camera-stabilized spatio-temporal feature clouds**. It leverages depth and camera motion information to lift 2D video features into a 3D world space where camera motion is effectively canceled, enabling robust tracking over extended periods. \n\n**TAPIP3D iteratively refines multi-frame 3D motion estimates** within this stabilized representation, enabling robust tracking over extended periods. To manage the inherent irregularities of 3D point distributions, the **Local Pair Attention mechanism** is introduced to exploits spatial relationships in 3D, forming informative feature neighborhoods for precise 3D trajectory estimation. The 3D-centric approach significantly outperforms existing 3D point tracking methods and even enhances 2D tracking accuracy compared to conventional 2D pixel trackers when accurate depth is available.", "affiliation": "Carnegie Mellon University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.14717/podcast.wav"}
