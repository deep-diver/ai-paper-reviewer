However, present systems are mainly conceptual prototypes. They face several difficulties due to shallow OS integration, unreliable screenshot-based interactions, and intrusive execution. The agents and the users cannot run concurrently because the agents' execution disrupts the users. The current automation methods are difficult to scale, adapt, and execute practically, limiting their uses in complicated and diverse situations. To address these problems, there is a need for reliable, integrated automation systems. \n\nThis paper introduces **UFO\u00b2**, a multiagent AgentOS for Windows desktops that elevates computer-using agents to practical, system-level automation. The system features a centralized agent for task coordination, application-specialized agents with native APIs, and a unified action layer. It combines Windows UI Automation with vision-based parsing for diverse interfaces. It enhances runtime efficiency through speculative multi-action planning. Finally, it introduces a PiP interface that allows parallel user-agent operation. **UFO\u00b2** achieves notable gains in robustness and accuracy when tested on over 20 Windows apps.", "affiliation": "Microsoft", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2504.14603/podcast.wav"}
