Existing 3D methods are limited to synthetic data, lack realism, or handle only single objects with restricted viewpoints. These methods also struggle with multi-object scenarios. Furthermore, accurate real-world training data with per-object orientation annotations is scarce, hindering supervised learning approaches.\n\nORIGEN tackles these issues with a **zero-shot method for 3D orientation grounding** in text-to-image generation using reward-guided sampling. By leveraging Langevin dynamics, it balances reward maximization with realism, avoiding local optima. The approach is enhanced with adaptive time rescaling for faster convergence and is implemented in a method that can be done with a single line of code. Experiments demonstrate superior performance compared to existing methods, including multi-object handling.", "affiliation": "KAIST", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.22194/podcast.wav"}
