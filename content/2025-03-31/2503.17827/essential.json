The absence of such benchmarks hinders the evaluation and enhancement of MLLMs in understanding how objects evolve over time and space. This poses a challenge, especially for tasks like digital twins and augmented reality where dynamic 3D assets are critical. Addressing this gap is essential for advancing interactive virtual experiences.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces **4D-Bench**, a benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in 4D object understanding with tasks in QA and captioning. The benchmark uses diverse 4D objects with high-quality annotations, necessitating multi-view spatial-temporal reasoning. Experiments reveal MLLMs struggle with temporal understanding, and even state-of-the-art models perform worse than humans. This underscores the need for further advancements in MLLMs for 4D object understanding.", "affiliation": "King Abdullah University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17827/podcast.wav"}
