Previous methods often rely on optical flow, which struggles with partial motion, complex deformations, and distractions. Humans effortlessly segment moving objects, inspiring the need for more robust automated solutions. Current solutions also struggle with differentiating camera vs. object motion and tracking objects through deformations, occlusions, and rapid movements.\n\nTo solve these issues, this paper presents a novel approach for moving object segmentation, integrating long-range trajectory motion cues with DINO-based semantic features. It leverages SAM2 for pixel-level mask densification via an iterative prompting strategy. The model uses **Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Attention and Motion-Semantic Decoupled Embedding** to prioritize motion while integrating semantic support, leading to superior performance.", "affiliation": "UC Berkeley", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.22268/podcast.wav"}
