These methods frequently violate joint angle limits, leading to unnatural and unrealistic poses. This gap highlights the need for approaches aligned with biomechanically accurate skeleton models. The paper aims to bridge this by creating predictions that respect anatomical constraints. \n\nThe study introduces a method named HSMR, which reconstructs humans using a biomechanically accurate skeleton from a single image. It uses the SKEL model and trains a transformer to estimate model parameters. Addressing the lack of training data, they create a pipeline to generate pseudo ground truth and iteratively refine it. HSMR matches state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks and improves results in extreme poses, ensuring realistic joint rotations.", "affiliation": "University of Texas at Austin", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21751/podcast.wav"}
