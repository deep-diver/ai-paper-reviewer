Existing implicit field methods often need costly conversions that degrade details, and other approaches struggle with high resolutions. To tackle these issues, this paper introduces a novel sparse-structured isosurface representation that enables differentiable mesh reconstruction at high resolutions directly from rendering losses. \n\nThe authors introduce **SparseFlex**, combining the accuracy of Flexicubes with a sparse voxel structure, focusing on surface-adjacent regions and efficiently handling open surfaces. A frustum-aware sectional voxel training strategy is introduced, activating only relevant voxels during rendering, dramatically reducing memory consumption and enabling high-resolution training. A variational autoencoder and a rectified flow transformer enable high-quality 3D shape generation with state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21732/podcast.wav"}
