Current MLLMs primarily function in one-hop question answering, falling short of the expert-driven, evidence-based analysis needed in real-world medical diagnosis. These models often exhibit hallucinations and inconsistencies in reasoning, making it difficult to strictly adhere to established medical criteria. This limitation raises safety concerns, highlighting the need for advancements to improve reliability and clinical applicability.\n\nTo solve these issues, the paper introduces **MedAgent-Pro**, an evidence-based reasoning agentic system. It uses hierarchical workflow that integrates medical guidelines and expert tools. Multiple tool agents process multi-modal inputs & analyze indicators, providing diagnoses based on quantitative and qualitative evidence. The system achieves superior results in 2D & 3D medical diagnosis tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18968/podcast.wav"}
