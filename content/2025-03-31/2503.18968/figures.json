It demonstrates that MLLMs, while capable of processing multi-modal data, often lack the precision and comprehensive reasoning necessary for reliable diagnoses.  Their limitations are highlighted in red text. In contrast, MedAgent-Pro, which leverages a reasoning agentic workflow, provides more accurate and evidence-based diagnoses, supported by visual evidence and relevant literature citations (green text). This showcases MedAgent-Pro's improved diagnostic accuracy and interpretability.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18968/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: The overall structure of our MedAgent-Pro framework. The blue text indicates different roles of agents, and the black text indicates medical information.", "description": "MedAgent-Pro uses a hierarchical workflow for medical diagnosis.  The task-level reasoning stage uses a planner agent (an LLM) to generate a diagnostic plan based on retrieved clinical guidelines and available tools. This plan is then executed in the case-level diagnosis stage using orchestrator and tool agents. The orchestrator agent manages the process, while tool agents (e.g., image processing models, coding agents, VQA models) handle specific tasks.  Finally, a decider agent integrates the results and delivers the final diagnosis, supported by evidence from the case-level analysis.", "section": "3 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.18968/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: A case study for glaucoma diagnosis, which illustrates the workflow for a case in our MedAgent-Pro framework.", "description": "Figure 3 presents a detailed case study of glaucoma diagnosis using the MedAgent-Pro framework. It visually outlines the workflow, starting from the knowledge-based task-level reasoning where a diagnostic plan is generated based on retrieved medical guidelines and available tools. The figure then moves to the evidence-based case-level diagnosis, showing how multi-modal patient information (e.g., fundus image) is processed through various agents (orchestrator, tool, coding, and summary agents) to extract relevant features. The process culminates in a final diagnosis decision made by a decider agent, demonstrating how the system integrates clinical criteria and visual evidence for an accurate and explainable diagnosis.", "section": "3 Methods"}]
