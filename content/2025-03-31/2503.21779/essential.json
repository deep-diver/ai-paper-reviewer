However, current methods discretize time into phases using respiratory gating devices, causing misalignment and limiting practicality. These rely on external hardware, are uncomfortable for patients, and often produce artifacts that obscure fine tissue details. Recent advances like Neural Radiance Fields(NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting(GS) improve 3D reconstruction but still struggle with continuous motion and hardware dependency.\n\nThis paper introduces **X2-Gaussian**, a novel framework for continuous-time 4D CT reconstruction. It integrates dynamic radiative Gaussian splatting with self-supervised respiratory motion learning. The method models dynamics via a spatiotemporal encoder-decoder predicting time-varying Gaussian deformations, eliminating phase discretization. A physiology-driven consistency loss learns breathing cycles directly from projections. X2-Gaussian achieves state-of-the-art performance and advances high-fidelity 4D CT for clinical imaging.", "affiliation": "The Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21779/podcast.wav"}
