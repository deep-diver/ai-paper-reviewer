It highlights two key components: 1) Dynamic Gaussian motion modeling, which captures continuous anatomical changes over time using a time-dependent deformation field applied to Gaussian splatting.  This allows for continuous-time reconstruction rather than discrete phase binning. 2) Self-supervised respiratory motion learning, which automatically learns the patient's breathing cycle directly from the projection data, eliminating the need for external gating devices. The framework is presented as a flowchart showing the data flow and interactions between these components.", "section": "4.

The images showcase the ability of each method to model dynamic anatomical structures, such as the diaphragm and airways, during respiration.  X2-Gaussian, the proposed method, demonstrates superior performance in capturing the continuous movement of these structures, resulting in clearer and more detailed representations than existing methods. This superiority is particularly evident in the accurate depiction of finer anatomical details, which are often blurred or lost in other reconstruction approaches.
