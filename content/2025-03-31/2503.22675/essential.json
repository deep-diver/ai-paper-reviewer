Current methods use a direct computation approach, where the encoder's final hidden state represents the user. But this method needs more depth to understand complex user behaviors. It also struggles with less popular items, leading to less-than-ideal recommendations. To fix this issue, this paper has presented ReaRec framework to enhance user profiles through multi-step reasoning, using special embeddings to separate item encoding from reasoning. \n\nTo unleash the power of ReaRec, the study presents **Ensemble Reasoning Learning (ERL)** and **Progressive Reasoning Learning (PRL)**, two new ways to learn. ERL uses ensemble learning to build multi-order user profiles, capturing different views of user interests, while PRL uses curriculum learning to guide the model from basic pattern learning to refining sequential patterns. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ReaRec. Remarkably, ReaRec improves performance across multiple setups, showing its potential for future research.", "affiliation": "Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence, Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Recommender Systems"}, "podcast_path": "2503.22675/podcast.wav"}
