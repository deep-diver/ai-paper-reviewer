The robustness index quantifies the degree to which biological features (like cancer type) outweigh confounding features (like medical center differences) in the model's learned representation. A higher robustness index indicates a model that better focuses on biological information, making it more robust to variations between medical centers.  The chart allows for easy comparison of the robustness of different models, highlighting which models are more or less sensitive to medical center biases.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.18055/extracted/6170945/fig/confounding-neighbors-fraction-same-center/confounding-neighbors-fraction-same-center-together.png", "caption": "Figure 4: Fractions of same-center confounders for all models. All models are sensitive to these differences, some to a very high degree.", "description": "This figure shows the fraction of same-center confounders for each model.  Same-center confounders are defined as neighbors in the embedding space of a misclassified sample that have the same incorrect prediction and originate from the same medical center.  The x-axis represents the number of neighbors considered (k), and the y-axis represents the fraction of those neighbors that are same-center confounders.  The plot reveals that all models exhibit a substantial influence of same-center confounders, with some models demonstrating a much higher degree of sensitivity than others, highlighting the impact of medical center differences on the models' performance.", "section": "5.2 Quantification of the Influence of Medical Center Differences on FM-based Prediction Performance"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.18055/extracted/6170945/fig/relation-log-reg-center-error-avg-CLS-nr_reps-5-nr_neighbors-3.png", "caption": "Figure 8: Relation between logistic regression errors and center-related knn errors. Samples that are more frequently misclassified by knn based on medical center are also more frequently misclassified by logistic regression, suggesting center similarities also affect logistic regression predictions.", "description": "Figure 8 shows the correlation between the errors generated by k-Nearest Neighbors (knn) and logistic regression models. The x-axis represents the frequency of center-related knn errors (i.e., how often the knn model makes an incorrect prediction due to the medical center of the sample). The y-axis shows the average fraction of logistic regression errors. The figure demonstrates a strong positive correlation: samples with a higher frequency of center-related knn errors also tend to have a higher frequency of logistic regression errors. This indicates that the medical center significantly influences both the knn and logistic regression models, suggesting that center similarities affect logistic regression predictions.", "section": "5.4 Relation between Prediction Performance and Robustness"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.18055/extracted/6170945/fig/hibou-b/tsne-BRCA-medical-center.png", "caption": "Figure 9: Embeddings for breast cancer colored by medical center for Phikon (left) and Phikon-v2 (right).", "description": "This figure visualizes the embedding spaces of two pathology foundation models, Phikon and its improved version Phikon-v2, specifically focusing on breast cancer cases. Each point represents a tissue sample from a particular medical center. The coloring of the points indicates the medical center of origin. This visualization helps to understand how well each model separates samples based on their biological characteristics (cancer type) versus confounding factors like medical center differences.  By comparing the two plots, one can assess the impact of model improvements on robustness to center variations.", "section": "Visualization of the Embedding Space"}]
