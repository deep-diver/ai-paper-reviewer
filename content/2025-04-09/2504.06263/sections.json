The capability of these models to process both **visual and textual information** allows for a deeper understanding of the input, leading to more accurate and contextually relevant results. These models can generate high-quality SVGs by leveraging pre-trained VLMs by parameterizing SVG commands and coordinates into discrete tokens, which in turn decouples structural logic from low-level geometry for efficient training and maintain the expressiveness of complex SVG structure. Moreover, the ability to reason upon visual and textual instructions enables the **synthesis of editable, high-fidelity SVGs** across diverse domains, ranging from simple icons to intricate illustrations and anime characters. However, challenges persist. The context window limitation in some VLMs can hinder the processing of complex SVGs requiring longer sequences. Future research could focus on extending the context window and improving the alignment between textual descriptions and visual outputs.
