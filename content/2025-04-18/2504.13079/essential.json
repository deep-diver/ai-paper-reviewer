{"importance": "This paper introduces a novel dataset, RAMDocs, to specifically address the issue of **handling conflicting information from multiple sources** for RAG systems. The **multi-agent debate framework** not only highlights the importance of **reasoning and filtering capabilities** but also opens new avenues for future research on building more robust and reliable RAG pipelines.", "summary": "RAMDocs: LLM agents can now navigate conflicting info with RAG! New dataset & multi-agent debate enhance response accuracy & reliability.", "takeaways": ["Conflicting information from multiple sources is a critical challenge for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems.", "Multi-agent debate frameworks can effectively improve the accuracy and reliability of RAG systems by reasoning and filtering conflicting information.", "The new RAMDocs dataset provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating the performance of RAG systems in handling ambiguity, misinformation, and noise."], "tldr": "Large Language Model(LLM) agents are increasingly adopting Retrieval-Augmented Generation(RAG) to improve the responses. However, the systems often need to handle ambiguous user queries & conflicting info from sources while suppressing the inaccurate info from irrelevant documents. Prior studies handled these challenges in isolation. This paper proposes a new dataset, **RAMDocs (Retrieval with Ambiguity and Misinformation in Documents)**, to simulate complex scenarios including ambiguity, misinformation, and noise.\n\nTo address this, the paper introduces **MADAM-RAG, a multi-agent approach** where LLM agents debate over an answer's merits, allowing an aggregator to collate disambiguated responses while discarding noise, jointly handling diverse conflicts. MADAM-RAG's effectiveness is demonstrated using both closed and open-source models on AmbigDocs, improving over RAG baselines by up to 11.40%, and on FaithEval, improving by up to 15.80% with Llama3.3-70B-Instruct.", "affiliation": "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2504.13079/podcast.wav"}
