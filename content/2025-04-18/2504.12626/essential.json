Addressing these issues often involves trade-offs, as enhancing memory can accelerate error propagation, while reducing error propagation can weaken temporal dependencies. Current solutions like encoding more frames become computationally intractable due to the complexity of transformers. Therefore, there is need to address both issues simultaneously in an efficient manner. \n\nThis paper introduces **FramePack**, a structure that compresses input frames based on importance, ensuring a fixed transformer context length regardless of video duration. Anti-drifting sampling methods break the causal prediction chain, using bi-directional context. Experiments show finetuning video diffusion models with FramePack enables balanced diffusion schedulers, improving visual quality. This helps mitigate forgetting and drifting in video generation.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.12626/podcast.wav"}
