### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current methods for character customization struggle with generalization and image quality due to reliance on U-Net architectures. Optimization-based methods compromise textual control. To tackle these challenges, this paper presents InstantCharacter. It is a framework for character customization using diffusion transformers. It overcomes the limitations of existing approaches. 



InstantCharacter achieves open-domain personalization with high-fidelity. A scalable adapter processes character features and interacts with the latent space. A large character dataset containing paired and unpaired subsets allows simultaneous optimization of identity and textual editability. The method improves image quality and controllability.

### In-depth insights


#### DiT Adaptation
**Adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiTs)** for specific tasks like character personalization presents unique challenges. While DiTs boast impressive generative capabilities, effectively channeling their power for personalized image generation requires careful consideration. The current adaptation methods are underexplored. It's crucial to develop **robust adapter networks** that can seamlessly integrate character-specific features into the DiT's latent space, ensuring alignment between the character's identity and the generative process. This involves designing adapters that are **scalable** enough to handle the complexity of DiTs and the nuances of diverse character appearances and styles. Furthermore, effective training strategies are essential to ensure that the adapter learns to faithfully preserve character identity while allowing for flexible text-driven modifications. The success of DiT adaptation hinges on addressing these challenges and developing novel approaches that fully leverage the potential of these powerful models.

#### Scalable Adapter
A scalable adapter is crucial for adapting foundation models to character-driven generation. **Scalability ensures the model can handle the complexity of diverse characters and styles without sacrificing fidelity or controllability**. The design must consider the model size and the type of features being processed. This adapter acts as a bridge, effectively translating character features into the generative space of the transformer. Traditional methods often fall short, highlighting the need for a more robust and scalable solution. A well-designed scalable adapter enables the preservation of character identity while allowing for complex text-driven modifications. **Effective integration of multi-stage character features is essential for maintaining consistency and detail**. The adapter's architecture often involves a series of encoders and integration mechanisms. Careful consideration of training strategies is required to ensure the adapter works effectively with the base model.

#### 3-Stage Training
The paper introduces a progressive three-stage training strategy, an essential component for effectively leveraging the collected versatile dataset. The first stage focuses on **character consistency**, utilizing unpaired data where a character image is used as a reference to reconstruct itself, thus preserving structural integrity. A resolution of 512 is found to be more efficient than 1024 in this stage. The second stage transitions to **paired training data** at the same low resolution, aiming to generate images of the character in different actions, poses, and styles based on textual descriptions. This stage enhances text controllability and mitigates the copy-paste effect. Finally, the third stage involves a **high-resolution joint training**, combining both paired and non-paired images, to substantially improve visual quality and texture. This strategy enables high-fidelity and textually controlled character images by preventing interference.

#### Vision Encoders
Vision encoders play a crucial role in character personalization frameworks. These encoders extract relevant features from reference images, enabling the system to understand and replicate the visual characteristics of the desired subject. **High-quality encoders are essential for capturing both abstract semantic information and fine-grained details** such as textures. Selecting the appropriate encoder architecture is important for performance. Using multiple encoders in parallel, such as SigLIP and DINOv2, can lead to a more robust feature representation. **The combination of diverse visual features improves the robustness and enables better character detail preservation,** which is important for character consistency. Fusion of features from different encoders offers enriched representation and better overall performance. 

#### Text Control++
**Text Control++**, hypothetically, would signify an advanced level of textual influence over image generation. It implies going beyond simple prompt adherence to achieve nuanced stylistic and content manipulation. This could involve disentangling textual attributes, enabling fine-grained control over specific image characteristics like color palettes, textures, and object arrangements. Furthermore, it suggests robust handling of complex, multi-faceted prompts, accurately capturing relationships between different elements in the scene. A crucial aspect would be mitigating prompt leakage, preventing undesired artifacts or biases from the training data from influencing the generated images. Ultimately, **Text Control++** seeks to empower users with unparalleled creative freedom, transforming textual input into highly customized and visually compelling results. A successful implementation requires a deep understanding of semantic relationships and architectural innovations enabling precise manipulation of image features based on text.

The adapter, composed of multiple stacked transformer encoders, progressively refines character representations for effective interaction within the DiT's latent space. The training process is depicted as a three-stage progressive approach: starting with unpaired, low-resolution images for pretraining, followed by paired low-resolution images for refinement, and concluding with paired, high-resolution images for fine-tuning, optimizing character consistency, textual controllability, and image fidelity.
