### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Frontier models inadvertently generate token sequences that facilitate model distillation, creating a vulnerability that model owners may want to address without compromising performance. The current distillation techniques also have the potential to reveal valuable intellectual property of frontier models, incentivize providers to restrict user-model interaction, and fail to inherit safe model behaviors, posing significant risks. 



To address these concerns, this paper introduces antidistillation sampling, a novel method designed to reduce the effectiveness of model distillation. By strategically modifying a model's next-token probability distribution, antidistillation sampling poisons reasoning traces, rendering them significantly less effective for distillation.The core objective of this sampling is to adjust a model's next-token distribution to balance two competing goals: sampling tokens with high likelihood under the original, unadjusted distribution and sampling tokens that effectively poison distillation attempts. This protects proprietary capabilities while preserving the original model's utility for downstream applications.

> üîº This figure demonstrates the effectiveness of antidistillation sampling in hindering model distillation while maintaining the teacher model's performance.  It presents the results of experiments on two benchmark datasets: MATH and GSM8K.  For each dataset, two rows display teacher model accuracies (left column) and student model accuracies (right column) achieved through distillation.  The sampling methods compared are baseline, temperature sampling, and antidistillation sampling.  The key finding is that antidistillation sampling substantially reduces student model accuracy compared to temperature sampling, even when the teacher model's accuracy remains similar across both methods.

The top and bottom rows shows results for MATH¬†[7] and GSM8K¬†[8], respectively. The left columns shows teacher accuracies under different sampling schemes, and the right column shows the performance of students distilled on traces sampled via these different sampling schemes. Notably, for the same teacher performance on both datasets, antidistillation sampling significantly degrades the performance of the distilled models relative to temperature sampling.

### In-depth insights


#### Anti-Distillation
**Antidistillation sampling** is presented as a strategic method to **limit the effectiveness of model distillation** without sacrificing the model's utility. The paper addresses the vulnerability where reasoning traces inadvertently facilitate distillation, potentially enabling competitors to replicate capabilities cheaply. Antidistillation sampling aims to **modify the model's next-token probability** distribution, **poisoning reasoning traces** and making them less effective for distillation, but this process should simultaneously maintain **high likelihood under the original distribution**. This approach protects proprietary knowledge and ensures the model remains useful for downstream applications, which may be important for businesses who want to protect their models from unauthorized replication.

#### Sampling Poison
Sampling Poison, as a hypothetical exploration derived from the "Antidistillation Sampling" paper, delves into the strategic manipulation of a model's output to thwart distillation efforts. The core concept revolves around intentionally introducing subtle, yet detrimental, alterations to the training data used for distillation. This could involve **modifying token probabilities**, creating **reasoning traces that appear coherent but lead to flawed conclusions**, or **injecting adversarial examples** that specifically target the distillation process. The goal is to render the distilled model less effective, either by **reducing its accuracy**, **impairing its ability to generalize**, or **introducing undesirable behaviors**. Effective sampling poison requires a delicate balance. The poisoned samples must retain sufficient fidelity to the original data distribution to avoid detection or rejection during the distillation process. Simultaneously, they need to be potent enough to significantly degrade the performance of the distilled model. This could involve **carefully calibrating the magnitude of the perturbations**, **targeting specific weaknesses in the distillation algorithm**, or **exploiting the inherent biases of the student model**. Sampling poison presents a significant challenge in ensuring the integrity and reliability of machine learning models.

#### Proxy Model 
The paper acknowledges that access to the **true student model architecture** during antidistillation is unlikely. Therefore, it introduces the concept of a "proxy model" (Œ∏p) as an **approximation of the student's learning process**. This proxy model facilitates the derivation of antidistillation sampling. The authors recognize the importance of **generalization**: the antidistillation strategy effective against the proxy must also hinder distillation to actual student models. It will allow the creation of poisoning to prevent the theft of model capabilities.

#### Utility vs. Poison
The core challenge in antidistillation lies in balancing **utility** and **poisoning**. The goal is to subtly alter a model's output so that it performs well on intended tasks, maintaining its utility, while simultaneously generating reasoning traces that are unsuitable for effective distillation. This requires a careful approach, as overly aggressive poisoning can degrade the model's performance and render it useless. On the other hand, insufficient poisoning might not deter distillation, leaving the model vulnerable to intellectual property theft. Achieving the right balance is critical, and this requires understanding the nuances of model behavior and distillation techniques. The effectiveness of antidistillation depends on the ability to introduce subtle but significant changes in reasoning traces that disrupt the distillation process without compromising the model's core functionality. This requires careful tuning of the antidistillation method and a deep understanding of the target model's behavior. A successful antidistillation strategy effectively walks a tightrope, ensuring that the model remains useful while making it significantly harder to distill.

#### Controlled Decode
**Controlled decoding** in LLMs represents a crucial area of research focused on steering the generation process. Instead of passively accepting the output, it actively shapes it based on defined objectives. This involves supplementary objectives to influence decoding, **contrastive learning, optimization & energy constraints**. The goal is to enhance qualities or prevent undesirable outcomes like biased or unsafe content. Techniques vary from manipulating token probabilities to incorporating external knowledge, all aiming to **balance model freedom with targeted control** over the generated text. The complexity arises from effectively guiding powerful models while preserving their creativity and fluency.

> üîº Figure 2 illustrates the tunable parameter Œª in antidistillation sampling, which balances teacher accuracy and the effectiveness of distillation.  A baseline using temperature sampling (œÑ) shows a trade-off: significantly reducing student accuracy requires a substantial drop (to 20%) in teacher accuracy.  In contrast, antidistillation sampling achieves comparable or better student accuracy reduction while maintaining a much higher (70%) teacher accuracy. This highlights the effectiveness of antidistillation sampling in protecting the teacher model's performance.

> Figure 2: Antidistillation sampling uses a tunable parameter ŒªùúÜ\lambdaitalic_Œª to control the trade-off between teacher accuracy and distillability. The baseline involves sampling from the teacher with increasing temperature œÑùúè\tauitalic_œÑ to show that we can produce traces that are bad for distillation at some cost in teacher accuracy. One important feature of the blue temperature sampling curve is that to bring the student accuracy down below the undistilled accuracy, the teacher performance has to drop to 20%. On the other hand, with antidistillation sampling, the teacher model can still get 70% accuracy while producing traces that bring the student‚Äôs performs down below the undistilled accuracy.

> üîº Figure 3 compares the performance of three sampling methods: antidistillation sampling, permutation sampling, and temperature sampling, on the GSM8K benchmark.  Antidistillation sampling aims to poison distillation by strategically modifying the model's next-token probability distribution. Permutation sampling acts as a control, demonstrating the impact of destroying information within the antidistillation method, while preserving statistical properties through random permutation and sign-flipping. Temperature sampling is a standard sampling technique used for comparison. The graph shows student accuracy (the accuracy of a model trained via distillation on the teacher model's output) as a function of teacher accuracy (the accuracy of the original teacher model).  The results show that antidistillation sampling significantly reduces student accuracy compared to temperature sampling while maintaining relatively high teacher accuracy. Permutation sampling shows an intermediate performance, suggesting that the strategic poisoning introduced by antidistillation sampling is necessary for its effectiveness.

The x-axis represents the step size (epsilon) used in the finite difference calculation, and the y-axis represents the relative error between the JVP result (exact gradient calculation) and the finite difference approximation. The graph shows that for a suitably chosen step size epsilon, the finite difference approximation accurately estimates the JVP, demonstrating the validity of this efficient method.
