[{"heading_title": "Response Limits", "details": {"summary": "The response length is strictly limited to **one page**, encompassing all content, including references and figures, ensuring conciseness. **Overlength responses will not be reviewed**, highlighting the importance of adhering to the specified limit. The guidelines emphasize that margins and formatting must conform to the provided style guide, as deviations will lead to rejection. This underscores the need for authors to meticulously follow the template to maintain uniformity. The use of ATEX is recommended as the provided style guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font, aiding in space management. This restriction ensures fairness and manageability for reviewers, fostering a focused and efficient review process by compelling authors to prioritize key arguments and evidence, avoiding unnecessary details or elaborations, and enhancing the overall quality and clarity of the rebuttal."}}, {"heading_title": "Rebuttal Scope", "details": {"summary": "Based on the provided text, the rebuttal's scope in this context is carefully defined to ensure fairness and prevent authors from introducing substantial new material or circumventing page limits. The authors can use it to address the reviewers' comments. Authors can optionally submit a rebuttal to address the reviewers' comments. The rebuttal is limited to factual errors, supply additional information requested by the reviewers, rebut factual errors, and supply additional information, not add new contributions (theorems, algorithms, experiments) that were absent in the original submission and NOT specifically requested by the reviewers. Authors should refrain from requesting significant additional experiments for the rebuttal or penalize for lack of additional experiments. Authors should refrain from including new experimental results in the rebuttal, especially when not specifically requested to do so by the reviewers. Authors can include figures with illustrations or comparison tables of results reported in the submission/supplemental material or in other papers. The response length is one page in length and includes references and figures. The rebuttal should **focus on clarifying existing work**, not introducing entirely new research avenues. This boundary helps maintain a level playing field for all submissions. Figures and tables may be included to support the rebuttal, as long as they adhere to the overall length constraint. Also, the rebuttal must maintain anonymity and cannot include external links that reveal the author identity or circumvent the length restriction. In essence, the scope aims to provide a structured opportunity for authors to address concerns while preventing significant alterations to the original submission."}}, {"heading_title": "Formatting Guide", "details": {"summary": "The formatting guidelines are designed to ensure a consistent and readable appearance for submitted rebuttals. **Two-column format** is mandated, with specific dimensions for the text area and column width. **Margins are precisely defined** to maintain a uniform look. The guidelines emphasize the importance of font choices and sizes, recommending Times Roman for the main text at 10 points, single-spaced, while sections are in 10-12 points. Figure and table captions should be smaller 9-point Roman. Citations need to adhere to a specific style. **Numbering of equations, figures, tables, and references should be distinct from the main paper** to avoid confusion. The text provides instructions on handling illustrations, graphs, and photographs, emphasizing the need for centered graphics with fonts and line widths appropriate for printed copies. The formatting instructions ensure consistency and optimal readability, aiding the reviewers in their assessment."}}, {"heading_title": "Graphics Quality", "details": {"summary": "In the context of research papers, ensuring **high-quality graphics** is paramount for effective communication. The guidelines emphasize the importance of **centering all graphics** to maintain visual consistency and a professional appearance. Authors are urged to prioritize **resolvability in printed copies**, acknowledging that reviewers might opt for hard copies. This necessitates careful consideration of font sizes and line widths within figures, ensuring they remain legible even when printed. The recommendation to resize fonts in figures to **match the body text** underscores the need for seamless integration with the overall document. Furthermore, the guide advises against assuming reviewers will zoom in to inspect minute details, highlighting the importance of **clear and discernible visuals**. For LaTeX users, employing `\\includegraphics` with a line width multiplier is suggested for optimal figure scaling. Ultimately, the focus is on creating graphics that effectively convey information, regardless of the viewing medium."}}, {"heading_title": "Anonymity Rules", "details": {"summary": "While the provided document doesn't explicitly use the heading \"Anonymity Rules,\" the concept of anonymity is addressed within the context of rebuttal submissions. The document stresses that, **just like the original submission, the rebuttal must maintain anonymity**. This implies that authors are prohibited from including any external links or references that could reveal their identity. The main intent is to ensure a **blind review process** is maintained even during the rebuttal phase, preventing potential bias. Maintaining the anonymity preserves the integrity of the review process. The document specifies that rebuttals **cannot include external links that reveal the author identity**. The document further implies that **circumventing the length restriction** might reveal the authors, and it should be avoided. Thus, strict adherence to anonymity is critical for a fair and unbiased evaluation of the rebuttal and the original paper."}}]
