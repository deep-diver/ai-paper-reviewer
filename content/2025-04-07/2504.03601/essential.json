Current LLMs struggle with multi-turn interactions, tool usage, and complex function calls, highlighting limitations in capturing real-world agent dynamics. These limitations hinder the development of more reliable and efficient AI agents.\n\nTo tackle these issues, **APIGen-MT, a new pipeline, leverages environment execution feedback and a review committee to ensure the high-quality of multi-turn agent data**. It first creates detailed task blueprints with verifiable actions. Then, it transforms these blueprints into realistic agent trajectories via simulated agent-human interaction. The synthetic data and trained XLAM-2-fc-r models are open-sourced to advance AI agent research.", "affiliation": "Salesforce AI Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Dialogue Systems"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03601/podcast.wav"}
