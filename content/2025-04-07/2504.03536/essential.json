{"importance": "This paper introduces a novel method for generating high-quality 3D human avatars from single images, which is crucial for applications in VR/AR and digital content creation. The novel framework significantly improves the geometric and visual fidelity of reconstructed 3D models. **The unified approach has better performance compared to the existing decoupled methods.**", "summary": "HumanDreamer-X enhances 3D human avatar creation from single images via Gaussian Restoration, boosting geometric consistency and visual fidelity.", "takeaways": ["HumanDreamer-X, a new framework integrating multi-view human generation and reconstruction, is introduced.", "An attention modulation strategy effectively enhances geometric detail and identity consistency across multiple views.", "Experiments demonstrate significant improvements in generation and reconstruction quality using the proposed approach."], "tldr": "Creating 3D human avatars from a single image is valuable but challenging. Current methods generate multiple views and reconstruct, but geometric inconsistencies lead to fragmented models. **To solve this, this paper presents HumanDreamer-X, a unified framework integrating multi-view generation and reconstruction. It uses 3D Gaussian Splatting for initial geometry and refines it with HumanFixer, ensuring photorealistic results.** \n\nHumanDreamer-X also addresses challenges with attention mechanisms in multi-view human generation, proposing a strategy that enhances geometric consistency. **Experiments show that HumanDreamer-X significantly improves generation and reconstruction quality, achieving better PSNR scores, generalization on diverse data, and applicability to various backbone models.**", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03536/podcast.wav"}
