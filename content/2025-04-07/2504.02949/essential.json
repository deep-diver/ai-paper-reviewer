Unified frameworks often struggle to achieve optimal performance in both areas simultaneously. VARGPT, a visual autoregressive model, supports mixed-modal input/output, but prior versions had limitations in instruction-following for image generation and domain coverage. This work aims to addresses the limitations of previous unified models, striving for better instruction following and more comprehensive generation.\n\nThis paper presents VARGPT-v1.1, **an improved version of VARGPT, that enhances both generative and comprehension capabilities**. It incorporates iterative visual instruction tuning with reinforcement learning, expands the training corpus to 8.3M visual-generative pairs, upgrades the language model backbone to Qwen2, enhances image generation resolution, and introduces emergent image editing capabilities without architectural changes. These enhancements allow VARGPT-v1.1 to achieve state-of-the-art performance in multimodal tasks.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.02949/podcast.wav"}
