Ouyang", "paper_title": "Video-based ai for beat-to-beat assessment of cardiac function", "publication_date": "2020-04-00", "reason": "This paper is an important reference because it showcases AI's capability in assessing cardiac function, which is relevant to the MedSAM2 paper's focus on medical image and video analysis."}, {"fullname_first_author": "O. Ronneberger", "paper_title": "U-net: Convolutional networks for biomedical image segmentation", "publication_date": "2015-00-00", "reason": "This paper is important as U-Net is a fundamental architecture for medical image segmentation, forming the basis for many subsequent models, including those built using MedSAM2."}, {"fullname_first_author": "F. Isensee", "paper_title": "nnU-Net: A self-configuring method for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation", "publication_date": "2021-02-00", "reason": "This is one of the top reference papers because it is about nnU-Net, a widely used and self-configuring method for deep learning-based biomedical image segmentation that is heavily used in the medical image analysis."}, {"fullname_first_author": "A. Kirillov", "paper_title": "Segment anything", "publication_date": "2023-00-00", "reason": "This is one of the top reference papers because it introduces the Segment Anything Model (SAM), which MedSAM2 builds upon and aims to improve for medical image segmentation."}, {"fullname_first_author": "N.
