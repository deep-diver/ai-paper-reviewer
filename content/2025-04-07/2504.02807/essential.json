Existing pipelines often suffer from overly aggressive pre-filtering, causing many math-relevant documents to be missed. Moreover, widely used general-purpose text extraction tools are not optimized for mathematical content, leading to a lack of both scale and fidelity. Beyond web data, math-related code corpora and synthetic datasets have shown promising potential, but remain either limited in scale or not fully open-sourced.\n\nThis paper introduces **MegaMath, the largest open-source English math corpus** to date, totaling 371.6B tokens. It comprises 279B tokens of web data, 28.1B of code, and 64.5B of synthetic data. During its construction, the authors conducted extensive ablation studies and optimizations across all domains to ensure both scalability and quality. It also includes an empirical demonstration including head-to-head comparison with existing math datasets, and further training on the latest Llama-3 series of models.", "affiliation": "MBZUAI", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.02807/podcast.wav"}
