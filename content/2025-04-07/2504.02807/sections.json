[{"heading_title": "Math Corpus++", "details": {"summary": "While the heading \"Math Corpus++\" doesn't appear directly in the text, we can infer its meaning. It suggests an improved, expanded, or enhanced version of a mathematical corpus, likely building upon existing resources. The document focuses on MegaMath, a novel dataset aimed at addressing limitations in current open math corpora. Thus, **MegaMath serves as a practical realization of the 'Math Corpus++' concept**, incorporating web data, code, and synthetic data. Key improvements likely involve higher quality data due to optimized extraction techniques, larger scale with a greater number of tokens, and increased diversity by integrating various sources and formats. The emphasis on curated pipelines and ablation studies further implies a dedication to quality and effectiveness beyond merely increasing the size of the corpus. **The goal is to boost model performance**, facilitate continued research in math reasoning, and provide adaptable choices for different tasks and computational constraints."}}, {"heading_title": "Data Curation++", "details": {"summary": "While 'Data Curation++' isn't explicitly in the paper, it evokes the idea of enhanced data handling. This suggests a move beyond standard practices, implying innovations like **AI-assisted cleaning**, **intelligent filtering**, or **dynamic dataset creation**. It hints at actively improving data quality and relevance, possibly through iterative refinement or adaptive sampling. '++' also signals a focus on scale and efficiency, suggesting methods for handling massive datasets or automating curation processes. The emphasis might be on **making data more usable for downstream tasks**, such as training large language models, by optimizing its structure, content, or metadata. Furthermore, 'Data Curation++' implies a commitment to **reproducibility and transparency**, with clear documentation of curation steps and data provenance. Techniques like version control, data lineage tracking, and automated reporting could be key components. This heading also emphasizes the **importance of diversity**, using intelligent methods to create balanced datasets. It may point towards a more sophisticated approach to data valuation, prioritizing data points that are informative or representative of the target domain. Ultimately, 'Data Curation++' suggests a **holistic approach to data management**, with the goal of maximizing the value and impact of the curated data."}}, {"heading_title": "LM Data Ablation", "details": {"summary": "**LM Data Ablation** analyzes the impact of training data subsets on model performance. By selectively removing or modifying specific data portions, researchers can pinpoint the most influential data sources. This helps understand model biases and vulnerabilities. Ablation studies can reveal if a model heavily relies on specific data, indicating potential overfitting or lack of generalization. Techniques include removing data from certain domains, reducing dataset size, or corrupting data to observe the model's resilience to noise. It also offers insights into the necessity of various components in training, optimizing for data efficiency and reducing computational costs. The goal is to ensure robust, unbiased learning by identifying data that causes issues and prioritizing the most effective training examples."}}, {"heading_title": "Scaling LMs Well", "details": {"summary": "**Scaling Language Models (LMs) effectively hinges on a confluence of factors, extending beyond mere parameter increases**. Data quality emerges as paramount; curated datasets with diverse, high-quality content demonstrably outperform larger, noisier datasets. **Architectural innovations**, such as attention mechanisms and efficient transformer variants, play a crucial role in enabling models to process longer sequences and capture intricate dependencies. **Training methodologies**, including optimized optimizers, learning rate schedules, and regularization techniques, are essential for stable and efficient convergence. Furthermore, **distributed training strategies** are indispensable for handling the computational demands of large models, necessitating sophisticated techniques for data parallelism and model parallelism. The pursuit of scaling also compels exploration into **novel model architectures** that can learn more efficiently and generalize better, with mixture of experts being one of them. The scaling pursuit necessitates a **thoughtful and holistic approach**."}}, {"heading_title": "Math: NL Scaling", "details": {"summary": "While the exact phrase \"Math: NL Scaling\" doesn't appear in this document, the core idea of **scaling Natural Language (NL) models** to enhance mathematical reasoning is central. The paper emphasizes the creation of MegaMath, a large-scale dataset for training such models. The success of o1 (OpenAI, 2024) and DeepSeek-R1 (Guo et al., 2025) is attributed to pre-training and reinforcement learning, highlighting the **importance of scale**. Datasets like DeepSeekMath's 120B tokens and Qwen-2.5-Math's 1T tokens are indicative of this trend. MegaMath itself aims to push these limits, delivering 371B tokens. A key aspect is not just scale, but also **data quality**. The paper describes various techniques for curating a high-quality dataset, including revisiting web data, recalling math-related code data, and exploring synthetic data. Techniques like two-stage extraction and filtering pipelines are also mentioned."}}]
