Fine-tuning or model editing aims to restrict inference, yet domain-restricted pretraining is data- and compute-intensive. This work addresses the challenge of leveraging LLMs for nuanced historical analysis without excessive computational demands, questioning the efficacy of standard LLM adaptation techniques. \n\nThis paper introduces efficient pretraining for useful models over corpora unsuitable for typical LLM approaches. Using a novel date-attribution pipeline, they create temporally-segmented datasets. Training five-model batteries via efficient pretraining and Llama3-8B parameter fine-tuning reveals that **pretrained models train faster, respect historical divisions better**, and enable diverse linguistic phenomena detection, offering a ready-to-use pipeline for various target fields.", "affiliation": "University of Hamburg", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05523/podcast.wav"}
