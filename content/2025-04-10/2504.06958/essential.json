Current methodologies in RL, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), show promise in the text and image domains, but their utility for video understanding is still limited. Therefore, there is a need for more exploration in video understanding and reasoning mechanisms.\n\nThis study presents a systematic approach to Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs to boost spatio-temporal perception, while ensuring general capabilities are maintained. The research develops **VideoChat-R1**, a video MLLM that reaches state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks. VideoChat-R1 significantly improves performance in areas like temporal grounding and object tracking without sacrificing its chat abilities.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2504.06958/podcast.wav"}
