{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers aiming to **enhance visual-language understanding and multimodal pretraining**. It offers a practical, scalable framework that leverages diverse data sources, caption formulas, and system prompts. The open-source nature and comprehensive benchmark evaluations make it a valuable resource for future research in this area.", "summary": "OmniCaptioner: One Captioner to Rule Them All! The paper introduces a versatile framework for generating fine-grained image descriptions across diverse visual domains.", "takeaways": ["OmniCaptioner provides a unified approach to captioning natural images, visual text, and structured visuals.", "The framework enhances visual reasoning in LLMs without additional fine-tuning by converting pixel data to detailed textual descriptions.", "Comprehensive evaluations show improvements in visual reasoning, image generation, and supervised fine-tuning tasks."], "tldr": "**Multimodal Large Language Models** (MLLMs) have made significant strides in image captioning and visual question answering, but they still struggle with perceptual accuracy in visual-text and structured image domains, especially with synthesized images. Recent research highlights the importance of image captioning in aligning modalities during multimodal pretraining and enhancing perception and reasoning. However, there is a need for a unified framework that can handle diverse visual domains, as current MLLMs often fall short of textual reasoning abilities compared to text-only LLMs. To solve the issues, OMNICAPTIONER is proposed. \n\nOMNICAPTIONER generates fine-grained textual descriptions across diverse visual domains, **bridging the gap between visual and textual modalities**. It converts low-level pixel information into semantically rich textual representations, preserving crucial visual details. This framework enhances visual reasoning with LLMs, improves image generation, and enables efficient supervised fine-tuning with less data. OMNICAPTIONER has a diverse visual domain coverage including natural images, visual text images and structured images. By using this versatile framework, it offers a new perspective for bridging the gap between language and visual modalities.", "affiliation": "Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.07089/podcast.wav"}
