Two opinion tuples are shown: (Italy, Bersany, beat Florence Mayor, positive) and (AUTHOR, Matteo Renzi, prominent, positive)", "description": "Figure 1 illustrates the output of opinion extraction for the RuOpinionNE-2024 shared task.  The task involves identifying opinion tuples within a given sentence, where each tuple consists of a sentiment holder (the entity expressing the opinion), a target (the entity being evaluated), a sentiment expression, and the polarity (positive or negative) of the sentiment.  The figure displays the input sentence in both Russian and English, along with the extracted opinion tuples. The first tuple shows that Italy expresses a positive sentiment towards Bersani for beating the mayor of Florence.  The second shows that the author views Matteo Renzi positively, describing him as 'prominent'. This example highlights the task's complexity, requiring the system to not only identify sentiments but also correctly link them to the appropriate holder and target entities.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
