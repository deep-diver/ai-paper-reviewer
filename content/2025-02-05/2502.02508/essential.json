Existing approaches often rely on external verification or extensive sampling, leading to inefficiencies. This paper tackles these limitations by introducing Satori, a novel LLM trained using a two-stage paradigm. The first stage focuses on internalizing a new reasoning format called Chain-of-Action-Thought (COAT), while the second leverages reinforcement learning to improve the model's ability to self-reflect and explore alternative solutions.\nThe proposed method results in a single LLM capable of autoregressive search without external guidance.  Satori surpasses state-of-the-art performance on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks and generalizes well to other tasks. This represents a significant advance in LLM reasoning, offering a more efficient and effective method for tackling complex problems. The researchers' commitment to open-sourcing the model and data will further accelerate research and foster community collaboration.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.02508/podcast.wav"}
