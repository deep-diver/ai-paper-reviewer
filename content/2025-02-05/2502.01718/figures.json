Then we adopt strong models like filter the noisy test cases. Finally, we adopt these test cases to harvest positive and negative program pairs for reward model training and RL.", "description": "The figure illustrates the workflow of the ACECODER model.  It begins with a seed code dataset, which is processed to generate well-formed coding questions and their corresponding test cases. A filtering step then removes noisy or unreliable test cases. The remaining, high-quality test cases are used to create positive and negative program pairs based on their pass/fail rates. These pairs are then used to train reward models, which are subsequently employed in reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the code generation model's performance.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
