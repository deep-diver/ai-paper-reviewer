### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Triangle meshes are essential in 3D applications. Existing auto-regressive methods, which generate structured meshes by predicting vertex tokens, often face limitations in face counts and mesh completeness. Moreover, these methods struggle with aligning outputs with human aesthetic preferences, leading to geometric inaccuracies and a lack of artistic refinement. These challenges hinder the creation of high-quality, artist-like 3D meshes.



To address these issues, this paper presents a framework that optimizes mesh generation through two key innovations. First, an efficient pre-training strategy incorporates a novel tokenization algorithm. Second, Reinforcement Learning (RL) is introduced into 3D mesh generation, achieving human preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). With a scoring standard combining human evaluation and 3D metrics, the framework generates detailed, precise meshes, outperforming existing methods in precision and quality.

### In-depth insights


#### Mesh Tokenization
**Mesh tokenization** is crucial for enabling transformer-based models to process 3D meshes. Efficient tokenization schemes aim to reduce sequence length, thereby decreasing computational cost and memory requirements. The key challenge involves balancing compression ratio with preserving geometric details and maintaining manageable vocabulary size. **Effective algorithms** typically employ techniques like face traversal, vertex quantization, and hierarchical indexing to represent meshes as discrete tokens suitable for auto-regressive modeling. Optimizing tokenization enhances training efficiency and enables the generation of high-resolution, artist-like meshes, addressing limitations in face counts and mesh completeness often encountered in existing methods.

#### DPO for 3D Mesh
**Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** has emerged as a promising technique for aligning generative models with human preferences, showing success in language models and vision-language models.  Applying DPO to 3D mesh generation could significantly improve the **aesthetic quality** and **geometric accuracy** of generated meshes. This involves collecting preference data where humans evaluate pairs of meshes and select the preferred one based on visual appeal and geometric correctness. A key challenge is designing a **scoring standard** that effectively captures human preferences for 3D meshes, potentially combining subjective visual assessments with objective 3D metrics like Chamfer distance and mesh quality metrics. Overcoming these challenges could lead to a new state-of-the-art in 3D mesh generation.

#### Pre-Training Refined
**Refining pre-training** is crucial for auto-regressive models. A refined pre-training phase could involve several key aspects. Firstly, it's about the data: **curating a high-quality dataset** is essential, filtering out noisy or incomplete meshes and prioritizing those with clean geometry and topology. Then there's the tokenization process. An efficient tokenization scheme could **reduce sequence length** without sacrificing geometric detail, leading to faster training and reduced memory consumption. Efficient tokenization allows us to use high-resolution meshes for training. A refined pre-training strategy ensures better initial weights, leading to faster convergence and improved final performance in downstream tasks like generating artist-like meshes.

#### Data Curation Vital
Data curation is vital because the **quality of training data fundamentally governs model performance**. In the context of 3D mesh generation, existing datasets often exhibit **high variability in quality**, including irregular topology, excessive fragmentation, or extreme geometric complexity. Addressing these issues through data curation is essential to mitigate potential problems such as unstable training, loss spikes, and compromised model generalization. A well-designed data curation strategy can filter out poor-quality meshes based on geometric structure and visual fidelity. This ensures that the model is trained on a **high-quality dataset**, leading to more stable training and superior mesh generation results. By focusing on clean, representative data, the model can learn more effectively and avoid being misled by noisy or incomplete examples. This enhances the overall reliability and performance of the 3D mesh generation process.

#### Scalable Artist Mesh
The concept of "Scalable Artist Mesh" is intriguing, suggesting a method to create 3D meshes that maintain artistic quality while scaling efficiently. This could involve novel mesh representations, tokenization, or procedural generation techniques. A key challenge would be balancing artistic control and computational cost, possibly using **hierarchical structures** or **adaptive mesh refinement**. Another aspect involves training data - the quality and size of artist-created meshes significantly impact the model's ability to learn and generate aesthetically pleasing results. **Reinforcement learning** to align outputs with human preferences could play a role, as could **data curation techniques** to improve the quality of training examples.

> 🔼 This table compares the performance of four different mesh tokenization algorithms:  the proposed method and three existing methods (AMT, EdgeRunner, BPT).  The comparison focuses on three key metrics: compression ratio (lower is better, indicating more efficient data representation), vocabulary size (smaller is better, implying faster training), and training time (shorter is better, representing higher computational efficiency). The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms the existing methods in all three metrics, achieving the lowest compression ratio, the smallest vocabulary size, and the fastest training time, showcasing its superior efficiency and compactness for mesh processing.
