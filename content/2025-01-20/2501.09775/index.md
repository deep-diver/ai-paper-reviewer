### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current LLM evaluation often relies on multiple-choice question accuracy, neglecting confidence. This paper investigates how LLMs' confidence changes when asked to provide reasoning before answering.  This is an important factor because the accuracy metric alone does not reflect the certainty the LLM has in its own answers. The study explores whether explaining the answer influences the LLM's confidence level. 

The study evaluates seven LLMs across diverse topics.  The results show that LLMs exhibit higher confidence when reasoning precedes the answer, regardless of correctness. This mirrors human behavior, where explaining an answer enhances confidence. The findings highlight limitations of current LLM evaluation methods and suggest a need for more nuanced approaches that consider both accuracy and confidence.

Two prompting methods are compared: a 'direct' prompt, where the model is asked to answer directly, and a 'Chain of Thought' (CoT) prompt, where the model is first asked to provide reasoning before selecting an answer. The chart displays the accuracy rates for each LLM under both prompting methods, allowing for a direct visual comparison of the effect of CoT prompting on model performance across different LLMs.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Confidence Metrics
LLM confidence metrics are crucial for evaluating the reliability and trustworthiness of Large Language Models (LLMs).  Current approaches often rely on the accuracy of LLM outputs, but this alone is insufficient.  **Confidence scores, derived from the model's internal probability distributions, offer a more nuanced evaluation.**  However, these probabilities present challenges.  **LLMs may exhibit overconfidence, assigning high probabilities to incorrect answers, particularly when employing reasoning steps before outputting a final answer.** This suggests that the act of reasoning itself, while often improving accuracy, can also inflate the model's perceived certainty, irrespective of the answer's correctness. Therefore, a comprehensive approach needs to examine both accuracy and the model's confidence, ideally with a focus on understanding how these metrics interact and how confidence is affected by different prompt strategies (e.g., chain-of-thought prompting).  **Further research is needed to calibrate LLM confidence scores and to develop more robust metrics that accurately reflect the models' true uncertainty.** This will involve a deeper investigation into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and how those relate to the expressed confidence in their outputs.

#### CoT's Impact on LLMs
The study investigates Chain of Thought (CoT)'s influence on Large Language Models (LLMs) performance and confidence in answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs).  **CoT prompting, which encourages LLMs to articulate their reasoning process before selecting an answer, demonstrably boosts their self-reported confidence levels.** This effect is observed regardless of whether the final answer is correct or incorrect, suggesting that CoT introduces a bias in LLMs' confidence estimations. The increased confidence, even with incorrect answers, may stem from the LLM's internal processing of the reasoning steps, making it more certain of its output, irrespective of accuracy.  This phenomenon aligns with similar observations in human behavior where explaining enhances confidence. The research highlights that **LLM-estimated probabilities should be interpreted cautiously due to the intrinsic limitations and biases** revealed by this investigation.   While CoT improves accuracy in some question categories, particularly those requiring complex reasoning, its impact on confidence surpasses its impact on accuracy. This emphasizes that **overconfidence in LLMs, even when using CoT, is a notable concern.** Further research is needed to better understand and mitigate these biases to improve the reliability of LLM evaluations.

#### Reasoning and Accuracy
The interplay between reasoning and accuracy in LLMs is a critical area of research.  The paper investigates how prompting LLMs to reason before answering multiple-choice questions (MCQs) affects both their accuracy and their self-reported confidence.  **A key finding is that the act of reasoning increases LLM confidence, irrespective of whether the final answer is correct or not.** This suggests that the reasoning process itself influences the probability assigned to the selected answer, regardless of its truthfulness.  This observation highlights a potential limitation of using LLMs' self-reported probabilities as a direct measure of confidence, since confidence is seemingly inflated by the reasoning step.  Further study is needed to understand how these behaviors relate to human cognition, and how to design better evaluation methods that account for this disconnect between reasoning, confidence, and actual accuracy.  **The research emphasizes the need for caution when interpreting LLMs‚Äô confidence scores,** particularly in cases requiring more complex reasoning.

#### LLM vs. Human Reasoning
A comparison of Large Language Model (LLM) and human reasoning reveals key differences.  **Humans utilize diverse cognitive processes**, including intuition, experience, and analytical thinking, to solve problems and make judgments, often integrating multiple sources of information. In contrast, **LLMs operate algorithmically**, relying on statistical patterns in their training data to generate outputs. While LLMs can mimic human-like reasoning in certain contexts, they lack the fundamental understanding and flexibility of human cognition.  **LLMs are prone to overconfidence**, even when incorrect, a characteristic less prevalent in humans.  This difference highlights the limitations of LLMs in complex tasks requiring genuine understanding and nuanced judgment.  Furthermore, **human reasoning is adaptable and context-aware**, adjusting strategies depending on the specific situation, while LLM approaches remain relatively consistent.  A deeper understanding of these differences is crucial for developing more robust and reliable AI systems.

#### Future Research Needs
Future research should prioritize a deeper investigation into the **discrepancy between LLM confidence and accuracy**, especially when reasoning is involved.  It's crucial to understand why LLMs become more confident, even when wrong, after generating reasoning.  Further analysis should explore whether this overconfidence stems from inherent limitations in probabilistic prediction or from a deeper issue related to how LLMs process and weigh evidence.  **Comparative studies** directly comparing LLM reasoning processes with human reasoning are needed to shed light on the nature of this discrepancy.  **Benchmarking across diverse question types** and domains is necessary to determine if this overconfidence is consistent across various reasoning tasks. Finally, research should focus on developing **evaluation metrics that are less susceptible to the biases** of LLM self-reported confidence, perhaps by incorporating other qualitative and quantitative measures of performance.
