The **compositional design** allows for easier control and editing, opening avenues for further research in 4D scene generation and beyond.", "summary": "CityDreamer4D generates realistic, unbounded 4D city models by separating dynamic and static elements, using specialized neural fields for each, and leveraging novel datasets for improved realism.", "takeaways": ["CityDreamer4D efficiently generates unbounded 4D city models by separating dynamic objects from static scenes.", "It uses custom neural fields for diverse objects (buildings, vehicles, background) improving realism.", "High-quality datasets (OSM, Google Earth, CityTopia) enhance the quality and diversity of generated cities."], "tldr": "Generating realistic 4D city models is challenging due to the complexity of urban environments and the need for temporal consistency. Existing methods often struggle with scale, diversity, and realism, particularly when dealing with dynamic elements such as vehicles.  This research aims to improve upon these methods. \n\nCityDreamer4D tackles this by employing a compositional approach. It separates the generation of static elements (city layout, buildings) from dynamic elements (traffic).  **Specialized neural fields** are used for each type of element, optimizing for their unique characteristics. The system also leverages **three new high-quality datasets** to improve realism. The proposed model significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of realism, view consistency, and overall 4D city generation quality, demonstrating the effectiveness of its compositional design.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08983/podcast.wav"}
