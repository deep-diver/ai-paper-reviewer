Panel (a) shows the distribution of various attributes within the dataset, highlighting its diversity in terms of content and style.  The visualization displays the frequency of different content labels (e.g., objects, nature, architecture), style prompt labels (e.g., artist, genre, technique), and content attributes (e.g., color diversity, element density, composition). This demonstrates the breadth and depth of the dataset. Panel (b) provides illustrative examples of content (top) and corresponding style instances (bottom) included in MM-StyleBench, further emphasizing the variety of styles and content captured within the dataset.

The pipeline begins by sampling content and style pairs from the MM-StyleBench dataset. These pairs are then used to generate stylized images using various stylization models.  Next, 2AFC (two-alternative forced choice) comparisons are created by pairing all possible stylized image results for each content-style pair. Human preferences are gathered through these comparisons and then processed via two heuristic filtering methods to produce global rankings, reflecting the relative aesthetic preference between the images. Finally, the proposed ArtCoT method, consisting of three art-specific prompting phases to mitigate MLLM hallucination, is applied to obtain MLLM rankings. The final step calculates the correlation between the MLLM and human rankings to quantify the degree of aesthetic alignment.", "section": "IV.

The analysis is broken down by various attributes from the MM-StyleBench dataset, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of MLLM performance. The Spearman's \u03c1 (rho) correlation coefficient, a measure of rank correlation, quantifies the agreement between MLLM rankings and human rankings for per-instance comparisons.  The results show that the ArtCoT prompting method consistently achieves higher alignment scores across all attribute categories within MM-StyleBench, particularly when dealing with long and detailed prompts, suggesting improved reasoning abilities for this more complex type of artistic evaluation.", "section": "VI.
