The pipeline involves three main stages: (a) Data Preparation and Sampling: Content and style pairs are sampled from the MM-StyleBench dataset, and then passed through various stylizers, creating a set of stylized images. These images are then used to create paired comparisons (2AFC) for human evaluation. (b) Human Preference Modeling: Human participants provide aesthetic preferences, using 2AFC comparisons that are collected and converted to a global ranking by filtering out noisy and unreliable data. (c) MLLM Evaluation and Alignment:  ArtCoT, a novel three-stage prompting method, is applied to elicit more reliable and nuanced responses from MLLMs on the same stylized images. This involves separate prompts for content analysis, art criticism, and summarization. The resulting MLLM rankings are compared with human preferences using correlation analysis to assess the degree of aesthetic alignment.", "section": "IV.

The figure shows Spearman's rank correlation (\u03c1) for per-instance alignment, broken down by various attributes from the MM-StyleBench dataset.  This allows for a fine-grained comparison of the effectiveness of different prompting strategies, including the base prompt, zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and the proposed ArtCoT method. The results demonstrate that ArtCoT significantly improves the alignment between MLLM rankings and human preferences, particularly for instances with longer and more detailed prompts. This highlights ArtCoT's ability to enhance MLLMs' aesthetic reasoning capabilities across a wide range of artistic styles and contexts.", "section": "VI.

It starts by constructing a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm. Then, it iteratively adds edges to this tree, prioritizing edges that minimize the degree imbalance between nodes.  The process continues until the desired number of edges is reached, resulting in a connected subgraph with a uniform distribution of node degrees. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with large graphs where exhaustive pairwise comparisons are computationally expensive, ensuring a balanced representation of nodes in the sampled subgraph.", "section": "IV.
