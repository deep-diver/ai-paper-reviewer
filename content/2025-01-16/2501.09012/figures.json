The process begins by sampling content and style pairs from the MM-StyleBench dataset. These pairs undergo stylization, generating multiple stylistic versions of the same content.  Then, pairwise comparisons (2AFC) are created from these versions, and human preference is collected for ranking. This data is then filtered and aggregated into global rankings.  The figure then showcases ArtCoT, a prompting method designed to improve the MLLM's aesthetic alignment by incorporating art-specific task decomposition into three stages: content/style analysis, art criticism, and summarization. Finally, the correlation between MLLM rankings generated using ArtCoT and the human rankings is calculated to measure the aesthetic alignment.", "section": "IV.

The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (\u03c1) is used to measure the alignment between MLLM rankings and human rankings of stylized images. The analysis is broken down by various attributes of the MM-StyleBench dataset, including content and style characteristics, revealing how these attributes influence MLLM performance.  The results demonstrate that the ArtCoT prompting method consistently achieves superior alignment across different attribute categories, particularly for complex and detailed prompts.

The key constraint is to ensure a uniform degree distribution in the resulting subgraph, meaning each node in the subgraph has a similar number of connections. The algorithm starts by creating a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm to guarantee connectivity. It then iteratively adds edges to the subgraph, prioritizing those that minimize the degree imbalance between nodes, until the desired number of edges is reached.  This approach helps to generate a subgraph that is both connected and has a balanced structure.", "section": "IV.
