Each question is meticulously annotated at both the page and layout levels. Page-level annotations are indicated by selected screenshots, highlighting the relevant pages for each question.  Layout-level annotations further refine this by using red boundary boxes to pinpoint specific sections (paragraphs, figures, tables, etc.) within those pages that contain the answer.  This multi-level annotation enhances the dataset's utility for evaluating various granularities of document retrieval models.", "section": "3 MMDocIR: Evaluation Set"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.08828/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2.

The bar chart displays the average word length for OCR text and VLM text in tables and images separately. The histogram visually represents the distribution of word lengths for each category, showing the frequency of different word lengths.
