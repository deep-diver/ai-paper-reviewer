This paper addresses this issue by proposing an alternative approach using machine learning models as a trusted third party within a framework called Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs).  TCMEs overcome the limitations of traditional methods by focusing on the model's capability and information flow control, achieving a balance between privacy and computational efficiency. \nThe core idea of TCMEs is to use a machine learning model to perform computations on private data, under strict constraints ensuring that no private information leaks during the process. This approach requires the model to be stateless and its information flow to be explicitly defined and verifiable. The paper presents several use cases where TCMEs can solve problems that are currently infeasible with cryptography, highlighting the framework's potential in diverse areas requiring privacy-preserving computations.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08970/podcast.wav"}
