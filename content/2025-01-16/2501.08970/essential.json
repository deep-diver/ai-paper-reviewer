These methods often require highly technical specifications and can be computationally expensive.  Furthermore, the need for trusted third parties limits scalability and practicality.\nThis paper introduces Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs), a novel paradigm that uses capable machine learning models as trusted third parties to enable secure computations.  TCMEs achieve a balance between privacy and computational efficiency by leveraging the power of machine learning to solve problems previously considered infeasible. The proposed approach is validated through several practical examples, demonstrating its potential in various applications requiring private inference.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08970/podcast.wav"}
