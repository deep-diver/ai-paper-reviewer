This necessitates a novel approach.  The core problem is the lack of trusted third parties in many scenarios, thus requiring complex cryptographic workarounds.\nThis paper proposes **Trusted Capable Model Environments (TCMEs)** as an alternative approach, employing capable machine learning models to act as trusted third parties. This enables secure computations for tasks previously impossible with cryptography by leveraging the models' computational power while maintaining privacy through explicit input/output constraints and stateless model operation.  The authors showcase how TCMEs can solve classical cryptographic problems and introduce several practical examples, highlighting its potential across diverse applications.", "affiliation": "Google DeepMind", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Privacy"}, "podcast_path": "2501.08970/podcast.wav"}
