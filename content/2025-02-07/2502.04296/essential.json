Current generative models often struggle with computational efficiency or fail to handle the diverse settings of real-world robotics.  Furthermore, existing methods for video generation can be computationally expensive, making real-time applications challenging.\n\nThe paper introduces Heterogeneous Masked Autoregression (HMA), a new approach that tackles these issues. **HMA uses heterogeneous pre-training** from diverse robotic embodiments, domains, and tasks to learn a generalizable action-video dynamic model.  **Masked autoregression** enables efficient video prediction, significantly improving speed and visual fidelity.  Experiments demonstrate that HMA achieves better visual fidelity and controllability than state-of-the-art models with a **15x speed improvement**, making real-time applications in robotics possible.  HMA can generate synthetic data and serve as a video simulator for efficient policy evaluation.", "affiliation": "MIT", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2502.04296/podcast.wav"}
