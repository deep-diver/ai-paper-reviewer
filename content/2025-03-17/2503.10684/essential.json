However, online videos are long and unsegmented, making it difficult to identify and label skills. Existing methods rely on sequence sampling or human labeling. To address this, the paper introduces Skill Boundary Detection (SBD), an annotation-free temporal video segmentation algorithm. SBD is inspired by human cognitive event segmentation theory. It leverages prediction errors from a pretrained action-prediction model to detect skill boundaries. The assumption is that a prediction error shows a shift in the skill. \n\nThis approach improves the performance of conditioned policies and their hierarchical agents. The method was evaluated in Minecraft, a rich open-world simulator with extensive gameplay videos. The SBD-generated segments improved the average performance of conditioned policies by 63.7% and 52.1% on short-term atomic skill tasks. The corresponding hierarchical agents improved by 11.3% and 20.8% on long-horizon tasks. Overall, the method leverages the diverse YouTube videos to train instruction-following agents.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10684/podcast.wav"}
