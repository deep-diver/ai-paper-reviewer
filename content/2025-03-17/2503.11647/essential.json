Current methods are limited by domain-specific training data or require per-video optimization, hindering their applicability to real-world scenarios.\n\nTo address the issues, the study introduces a framework that **reproduces dynamic scenes with novel camera trajectories.** It harnesses generative capabilities through a video conditioning mechanism, often overlooked in current research. The scarcity of qualified training data is addressed by constructing a multi-camera synchronized video dataset. The study improves robustness through a training strategy, outperforming existing approaches.
