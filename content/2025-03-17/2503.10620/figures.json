SpireBase undergoes continued pre-training (CPT) using a mixture of text data from the TOWER model and English speech data transcribed using HuBERT-based k-means clustering into discrete speech units (DSUs).  SpireFull then takes the SpireBase model and further fine-tunes it through instruction tuning (IT) using additional data including task-specific datasets for machine translation (MT), automatic speech recognition (ASR), and speech translation (ST). The figure visually depicts the data flow and processing steps involved in building both models.", "section": "3 SPIRE: A Speech-to-Text LLM"}]
