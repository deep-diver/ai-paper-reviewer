Specifically, it shows how State-offset Tuning modifies a Mamba block, a type of SSM, by injecting a trainable state offset (h') at each time step. This is done while keeping the other model parameters frozen, allowing for efficient adaptation without retraining the entire model.  The added state offset allows for improved downstream performance. The figure visually depicts the integration of the state offset within the architecture of the Mamba block.", "section": "4 Proposed State-based PEFT Method"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.03499/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: \nVisual comparison of prompt-based methods and state-based methods in the S6 block.", "description": "Figure 2 illustrates the differences between prompt-based and state-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods within the context of the S6 block of a state-space model (SSM). Prompt-based methods, such as Prefix-Tuning, operate externally to the SSM by using external virtual tokens that influence the hidden state indirectly.  State-based methods, conversely, directly modify the internal state-related features within the SSM.  The figure visually compares the operation of Prefix-Tuning with the state-based methods: Initial State Tuning, and the proposed State-offset Tuning (h) and (y). It highlights that state-based methods directly adjust the state at each timestep, resulting in more efficient adaptation compared to prompt-based methods which have diminishing influence over time.", "section": "A Visual Comparison of Prompt-based Methods and State-based Methods"}]
