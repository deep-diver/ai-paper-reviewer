MaskGIT suffers from information loss due to discrete tokenization, while MAR falls short of VAR in limited sampling steps. Masked diffusion models (MDMs) show potential in text generation, but their applicability to image generation is unclear. Existing methods are either inefficient, lack scalability, or are not applicable to various data types.\n\nThis paper introduces **eMIGM, a unified framework integrating masked image modeling and masked diffusion models**. eMIGM systematically explores training and sampling strategies, optimizing performance and efficiency. Key innovations include higher masking ratios, a weighting function inspired by MaskGIT/MAE, CFG with Mask, and a time interval strategy for classifier-free guidance. eMIGM demonstrates strong performance on ImageNet generation, outperforming VAR and achieving comparable results to continuous diffusion models with less compute.", "affiliation": "Renmin University of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.07197/podcast.wav"}
