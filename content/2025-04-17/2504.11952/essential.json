It shifts from binary classification to a token-classification approach, distinguishing writing styles within text rather than classifying the entire input. This method improves performance across diverse domains, generators, and adversarial inputs and non-native speakers' texts.\n\nThe study introduces a new dataset of over 2.4M co-authored texts in 23 languages created using 12 LLMs (*GPT-4, Gemini*). The **models** are trained to identify AI-generated text in various scenarios, including unseen domains, generators, texts by non-native speakers, and adversarial inputs. Results from benchmarks highlight the effectiveness and limitations of the models, contributing valuable insights for mitigating AI-generated text harms.", "affiliation": "Traversaal.ai", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.11952/podcast.wav"}
