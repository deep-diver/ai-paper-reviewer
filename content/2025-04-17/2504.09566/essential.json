Current CoT methods rely on fixed or heuristic decomposition strategies, often missing essential details. Also, the reasoning process includes redundant computations due to a lack of systematic planning, increasing resource consumption and latency. Therefore, current robustness and accuracy still face significant challenges.\n\nThis paper proposes Syzygy of Thoughts (SoT), inspired by Minimal Free Resolution (MFR). **SoT extends CoT by introducing auxiliary reasoning paths, capturing deeper logical dependencies**. MFR decomposes modules into free modules with minimal rank, providing a structured analytical approach. **SoT systematically decomposes problems into logically complete minimal subproblems, preserving key features while reducing reasoning length.** Experiments show SoT matches or surpasses mainstream CoTs in accuracy, enhancing scalability and transparency.", "affiliation": "University of Electronic Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.09566/podcast.wav"}
