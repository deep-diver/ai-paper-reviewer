SoT Overview.

It illustrates how SoT leverages the Minimal Free Resolution (MFR) method to decompose complex reasoning problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems. The figure showcases the six key modules within SoT: Module, Betti Numbers, Freeness, Mapping, Exactness, and Minimality. Each module represents a specific stage in the problem-solving process. The \"Module\" stage defines the initial complex problem. \"Betti Numbers\" quantify the complexity of the problem.  \"Freeness\" generates necessary auxiliary conditions.  \"Mapping\" defines solution strategies.  \"Exactness\" ensures logical soundness.  Finally, \"Minimality\" optimizes the solution for efficiency. The interplay between these modules, guided by MFR principles, enables LLMs to break down complex reasoning tasks into a series of simpler steps, ultimately leading to more accurate answers.
