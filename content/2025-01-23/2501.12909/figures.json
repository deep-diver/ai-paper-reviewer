The framework uses LLMs to simulate the roles of a film crew (director, screenwriter, actors, cinematographer), mimicking the human workflow.  The process is divided into three stages: idea development (story brainstorming and outlining), scriptwriting (dialogue and action creation), and cinematography (camera setup and shot design).
