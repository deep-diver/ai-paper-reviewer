{"importance": "This paper is important for researchers, especially in software engineering and open-source development, because it highlights the impact of toxicity on bug resolution. By identifying toxicity patterns and their effects on collaboration, it paves the way for **developing automated systems to mitigate toxicity**. This research underscores the importance of fostering a constructive online environment and offers insights for future investigations into improving communication and collaboration in software projects.", "summary": "Toxicity derails bug report discussions, hindering resolutions in open source projects. ", "takeaways": ["Toxicity often stems from mismatched perceptions of bug severity and priority.", "Toxic interactions reduce the likelihood of bug resolution through pull requests or fixes.", "Toxicity can extend beyond interpersonal negativity, including negative sentiment toward the technology involved."], "tldr": "Bug reports, crucial for identifying and resolving software defects, are susceptible to toxic interactions due to their problem-focused nature. Such toxicity disrupts communication, hampers collaboration, and may discourage users, ultimately derailing collaborative efforts needed for resolving software issues. Prior research has explored toxicity in broader software engineering contexts, but bug reports remain underexplored. This study bridges the gap by analyzing how toxicity manifests in bug reports and its effects on bug resolution. \n\nThis paper qualitatively analyzes 203 bug threads from GitHub, identifying 81 with toxic interactions. The findings showed that toxicity often arises from misaligned perceptions of bug severity, unresolved frustrations with tools, and lapses in professional communication. The research also found that toxic interactions hinder collaboration and reduce the likelihood of actionable outcomes, such as linking issues with pull requests. The insights offer actionable recommendations to **mitigate toxicity, enhance communication, and improve bug resolution**.", "affiliation": "Missouri University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Security"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10072/podcast.wav"}
