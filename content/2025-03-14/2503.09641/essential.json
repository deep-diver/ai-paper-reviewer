Existing methods to speed up inference, like GAN-based approaches and consistency models (CMs), have limitations such as training instability and quality erosion in ultra-few-step regimes. These challenges hinder broader adoption, highlighting the need for a framework that balances efficiency, flexibility, and quality.\n\nTo solve the issues, the paper presents **SANA-Sprint**, an efficient diffusion model for ultra-fast text-to-image (T2I) generation. **SANA-Sprint** is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps. It introduces a training-free approach for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), combined with latent adversarial distillation (LADD) to enhance single-step generation fidelity. Integrated with ControlNet, **SANA-Sprint** enables real-time interactive image generation, achieving state-of-the-art performance in speed-quality tradeoffs.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.09641/podcast.wav"}
