Real-world environments are inherently dynamic, and vision models can't achieve pixel-aligned, object-wise video features. This poses challenges for building an accurate 4D language field. Existing models extract global video-level features, overlooking specific object-level details, leading to difficulty in spatiotemporal semantic representation. \n\nTo address these challenges, **4D LangSplat** uses multimodal large language models to generate detailed, temporally consistent captions for each object throughout a video. These captions serve as pixel-aligned, object-specific feature supervision, facilitating open-vocabulary queries. A status deformable network models smooth transitions exhibited by objects. This captures gradual transitions, enhancing the model's temporal consistency.", "affiliation": "Harvard University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.10437/podcast.wav"}
