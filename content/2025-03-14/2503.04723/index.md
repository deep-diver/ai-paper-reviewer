### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has largely concentrated on processing extended input contexts, enhancing long-context comprehension. However, the generation of long-form outputs has been comparatively overlooked. This creates a critical gap, as many real-world applications, such as novel writing and complex reasoning, demand models capable of producing coherent, contextually rich, and logically consistent extended text. Current instruction-following datasets are dominated by short input-output pairs, limiting both research and application. Additionally, generating long-form content adds task execution complexities that are not present in shorter tasks. Computational costs also increase linearly, placing a substantial burden on researchers. 



This paper advocates for a paradigm shift in NLP research, urging researchers to prioritize the challenges of long-output generation. It defines models optimized for long-output tasks as long-output LLMs and underscores the need for innovation in this under-explored domain. The study analyzes real-world user requests and paper publication trends, revealing a significant imbalance between demand for and research focus on long-output capabilities. It emphasizes the need for new datasets, benchmarks, and evaluation techniques tailored for long-output LLMs to unlock their potential in various domains.

### In-depth insights


#### Output, Not Input
**Shifting the focus from input to output in LLMs is crucial.** Current research heavily emphasizes processing long input contexts. A shift is needed to address challenges in long-form output generation. **Tasks like novel writing, long-term planning, and complex reasoning require coherent and logically consistent extended text.** This highlights a gap in LLM capabilities, necessitating research focused on generating high-quality, long-form outputs. This shift holds immense potential for real-world applications. Current LLMs are more optimized for understanding and processing information than they are for generating extensive, detailed, and logical content. Focusing on output could improve the quality of generated content.

#### Demand > Research
**Demand exceeding research** implies a critical gap. Real-world needs for complex problem-solving and long-form content are not met by current research focus, which may prioritize short input or task. This discrepancy hints at a potential misallocation of resources or perhaps methodological issues in addressing real-world complexities. Ignoring user needs in real tasks can hinder genuine progress in AI's applicability.

#### Beyond 4K Tokens
The pursuit of LLMs excelling **beyond 4K tokens** marks a critical shift in AI. Current benchmarks reveal performance dips beyond this threshold, signaling a need for architectural innovation. Addressing this requires novel training methodologies, enhanced memory management, and scalable architectures. **Overcoming this limitation** opens doors to applications demanding extensive context, like generating long-form content and long chain-of-thought reasoning, enabling richer, more coherent interactions and unlocking **new frontiers** in AI capabilities for solving complex real-world problems.

#### LLM Eval Bottleneck
The LLM evaluation bottleneck highlights the difficulties in assessing the quality of long-form text, especially for coherence and consistency. **Existing metrics are either rule-based,** focusing on specific aspects like token count, **or LLM-based,** which are computationally expensive and less interpretable. A key challenge is the lack of reliable ground truth for subjective qualities like creativity. **The high cost of API** and the absence of effective evaluation frameworks hinders the accurate analysis of long-output LLMs.

#### Scaling is Key
**Scaling** is undoubtedly crucial in advancing any AI model. The ability to handle larger datasets and longer contexts directly impacts performance. Scaling compute allows for training larger models, capturing intricate patterns. This is particularly relevant to **long-output LLMs**, where generating coherent and consistent text requires understanding extensive contexts. **Scalability** also plays a pivotal role in enabling real-time applications and handling increased user demand. Therefore, **efficient scaling** strategies are vital for broader adoption and impact.

> üîº The LongWriter-Ruler test evaluates the maximum output length various large language models can generate.  The results show that across different models, including GLM-4, Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-4, and Claude, there's a consistent limitation: none of the models could reliably generate text exceeding approximately 2,000 words. This suggests a significant constraint on current LLMs' ability to produce truly long-form outputs.
