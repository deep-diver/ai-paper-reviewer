VFMs excel at capturing fine-grained features, while VLMs provide robust text alignment but struggle with granularity. Integrating VFMs and VLMs using attention mechanisms is difficult because increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. Thus, there is a need for new method to capture each strength. \n\nTo address these challenges, this paper proposes **MFuser, a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines VFMs and VLMs**. MFuser includes MVFuser, a co-adapter that jointly fine-tunes the models and captures sequential and spatial dynamics, and MTEnhancer, a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings using image priors. This method achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without significant computational overhead, outperforming existing DGSS methods.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.03193/podcast.wav"}
