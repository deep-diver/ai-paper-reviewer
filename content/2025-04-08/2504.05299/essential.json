Smaller VLMs often mirror larger models, leading to inefficient memory usage and constrained practicality. This paper addresses issues by **introducing a series of compact multimodal models** engineered for efficient inference, **SmolVLM**.\n\nThrough architectural exploration, tokenization, and data curation, key design choices are identified that substantially improve performance on image and video tasks with minimal memory footprint. The models demonstrate robust video comprehension, strategic architectural optimizations, efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data. **This facilitates practical, energy-efficient deployments at smaller scales**.", "affiliation": "Hugging Face", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05299/podcast.wav"}
