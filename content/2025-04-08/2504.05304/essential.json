To address these limitations, Gaussian mixture flow matching (GMFlow) model is proposed, which predicts dynamic Gaussian mixture parameters capturing multi-modal flow velocity distributions instead of predicting the mean. It generalizes previous models and can be trained with a KL divergence loss.\n\nInference is done using novel GM-SDE/ODE solvers with analytic denoising distributions. A novel probabilistic guidance scheme solves over-saturation of CFG and improves image generation. It outperforms flow matching baselines in generation quality, reaching a Precision of 0.942 with 6 steps on ImageNet 256x256. It minimizes the KL divergence between the predicted and ground truth velocity distribution, a generalization of previous diffusion and flow matching models.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05304/podcast.wav"}
