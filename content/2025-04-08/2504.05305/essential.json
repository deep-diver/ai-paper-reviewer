Existing methods often lack context awareness, producing generic captions and failing to capture unique regional attributes. Datasets often focus on salient objects, missing nuanced regional descriptions. It's crucial to describe regions at any level for real-world tasks.\n\nThis paper introduces a novel dataset and model to tackle these challenges. The paper introduces URECA, a new dataset tailored for unique captioning across multiple granularities. It also introduces URECA a novel captioning model that uses mask encoder and dynamic modeling to retain details in regions. URECA achieved better performance on a test set than models that did not incorporate it.", "affiliation": "Korea University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.05305/podcast.wav"}
