### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** have demonstrated excellent capabilities across various domains, especially in code generation, however, critique benchmarks often lack comprehensive code related tasks. **Existing critique benchmarks** prioritize general reasoning, overlooking vital aspects of software development such as error identification and code QA. This gap hinders the development of robust LLM-based coding assistance and automated code review systems. To address this, **a comprehensive and specialized evaluation** is needed. 

To address the limitations, The paper introduces **CodeCriticBench**, a holistic benchmark for code critique by LLMs. It covers code generation and QA with varied difficulty, incorporating basic/advanced evaluations for comprehensive ability analysis. **The findings** reveal that LLMs face unique challenges in code-related critique tasks, marking a significant step towards enhancing LLMs for software development and ensuring thorough evaluation.

The basic critique evaluation involves a simple correct/incorrect judgment with a justification. The advanced critique evaluation uses a more detailed, fine-grained evaluation checklist with scores (1-10) for various aspects of the AI assistant's response, leading to a comprehensive score.

### In-depth insights


#### LLM Code Critique
The paper introduces CodeCriticBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs' code critique abilities. It addresses limitations in existing benchmarks by focusing on **diverse code-related tasks** (generation and QA) and offering comprehensive evaluation across dimensions. **Crucially, the benchmark includes both basic (correct/incorrect) and advanced critique evaluations,** with fine-grained checklists for detailed assessments. This comprehensive approach allows for a more **thorough analysis of LLMs' critique capabilities,** including identifying errors, providing insightful feedback, and suggesting improvements. By evaluating a wide range of LLMs, the authors provide valuable insights into their code critique performance, paving the way for future research.

#### Basic vs. Advanced
**Basic critique** likely involves simple correctness checks, while **advanced critique** dives deeper. Advanced methods could use fine-grained metrics, offering richer insights than basic 'correct/incorrect' judgments. Fine-grained analysis with well-designed checklists can offer more detailed and precise assessment of the models' critique capabilities than basic evaluation.

#### CodeCriticBench
**CodeCriticBench**, a novel benchmark, aims to address limitations in existing critique benchmarks, particularly regarding code-related tasks. It **offers a holistic** approach by including both code generation and code QA tasks with varying difficulties. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domains and may lack comprehensive evaluation. This benchmark provides two evaluation protocols, specifically basic and advanced, to thoroughly assess the critique abilities of LLMs. The advanced critique evaluation features fine-grained checklists for detailed analysis and the existing LLMs' experimental results showcase the effectiveness of **CodeCriticBench**.

#### Scaling Analysis
Scaling analysis is a critical aspect of evaluating the performance of language models. **Model size** is clearly important; with more parameters, **accuracy increases**, showcasing dataset strength. The **relationship between parameters and performance validates** the dataset's robustness, which is seen in the clear improvement as model size increases. These **scaling trends are essential for** researchers to **optimize resource allocation and develop more efficient models**, while also further solidifying **trust in the datasets** used to train the model with reliable benchmarks. The **robustness of models** is what scaling laws measure.

#### Future: Repo Critique
The prospect of a **future 'Repo Critique'** domain presents fascinating challenges. It envisions LLMs evaluating code repositories, demanding nuanced comprehension. This goes beyond single-file analysis, requiring understanding of inter-file dependencies, project structure, commit history, and collaborative dynamics. This area will test LLMs' ability to reason about code at multiple levels of abstraction. It will also necessitate incorporating contextual information like documentation, issue trackers, and version control metadata. Developing robust metrics will be crucial, perhaps involving simulations of real-world development tasks. The scope is huge, needing LLMs to consider quality and security within the context of practical coding scenarios and team collaboration. In essence, the 'Repo Critique' sets high benchmarks to fully evaluate the code reasoning capabilities of LLMs within realistic, intricate and time based software projects.

> üîº The figure illustrates the process of collecting data for the CodeCriticBench benchmark.  It begins with selecting algorithm problems from CodeForces, MBPP, and LiveCodeBench datasets.  These problems are then used to generate code using LLMs.  A bug insertion process is implemented, introducing various error types into the correct code generated by LLMs. These samples undergo filtering rounds: first a sandbox execution to confirm error triggering, then a manual review to confirm error alignment with the intended categories. For the code QA task, a rule-based filtering process first cleans the raw question-answer pairs collected from StackOverflow. Qwen2.5-72B is then used to generate new questions, while manual filtering and LLM-assisted reviews ensure high quality.

The mean squared error (MSE) is used as the evaluation metric, representing the difference between the model's predicted scores and human-assigned scores across multiple fine-grained evaluation dimensions. As the number of parameters in the model increases, the MSE generally decreases. This indicates that larger models tend to provide more accurate and comprehensive feedback for code critique.
