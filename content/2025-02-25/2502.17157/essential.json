In computer vision, task representations differ greatly, making it hard to create versatile solutions. Fine-tuning models for new tasks remains a challenge. Existing efforts fall short of specialized models, requiring costly training and data.\n\nDICEPTION, is a diffusion model for many vision tasks, tackling challenges with limited resources. It matches state-of-the-art performance using a fraction of the data. By using color encoding for outputs, it allows use of pre-trained text-to-image models.DICEPTION trains efficiently and adapts to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Segmentation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.17157/podcast.wav"}
