Current face methods often treat understanding and generation separately, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, a first UMM tailored specifically for face understanding and generation is introduced. The proposed model aims to train specifically for fine-grained face understanding and generation.\n\nIn response to the above issue, the paper proposes UniFace, trained on UniF\u00b2ace-130K, a new dataset with detailed image-text pairs and VQAs spanning facial attributes. A dual discrete diffusion (D3Diff) loss bridges masked generative models and score-based diffusion, improving face synthesis.  The results of extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFace outperforms existing UMMs and generative models and achieves superior performance across understanding and generation tasks.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.08120/podcast.wav"}
