Reference-based methods guide generation using upsampled references but face issues: latent space upsampling causes manifold deviation, degrading quality, while RGB space upsampling produces overly smooth results. This requires novel frameworks to mitigate these problems.\n\nLSRNA is introduced, combining Latent space SR (LSR) for manifold alignment with Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance details. LSR maps low-resolution latent representations onto higher-resolution manifolds, and RNA adaptively injects Gaussian noise into upsampled reference latents. Experiments demonstrate that LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art methods, preserves detail, and accelerates generation.", "affiliation": "Yonsei University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18446/podcast.wav"}
