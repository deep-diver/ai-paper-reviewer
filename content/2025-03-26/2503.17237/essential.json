Existing methods often involve complex enhancements. This paper addresses the challenge by introducing a straightforward approach, leveraging recent advances in object detection and tracking algorithms. Instead of YOLOv5 and DeepSORT, it uses YOLOv12 with BoT-SORT.\n\nThe paper establishes a baseline using **YOLOv12 and BoT-SORT for multi-UAV tracking**, with tailored training strategies. The approach achieves competitive performance without relying on contrast enhancement or temporal information fusion. The study analyzes the impact of input image size and tracker buffer tuning to enhance multi-UAV tracking performance.", "affiliation": "University of Melbourne", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Object Detection"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17237/podcast.wav"}
