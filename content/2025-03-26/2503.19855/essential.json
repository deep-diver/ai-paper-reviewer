This novel method iteratively refines answers, significantly enhancing accuracy on complex tasks.", "takeaways": ["Multi-round Thinking enhances LLM reasoning by iteratively refining answers, leveraging previous outputs as prompts.", "The method shows consistent performance improvements across multiple models and benchmarks without additional training.", "Lexical analysis reveals that Multi-round Thinking leads to more confident and decisive reasoning in LLMs."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown improved performance with test-time scaling. However, challenges like long texts and reinforcement learning inefficiencies remain. To address these limitations, the paper introduces **Multi-round Thinking**, a test-time scaling approach. It iteratively refines reasoning by using previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. This method aims to enhance reasoning without requiring extensive model retraining or complex setups, thus offering a practical and scalable solution.\n\nThe research demonstrates that the **Multi-round Thinking** enhances performance across models like QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1 on AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. The accuracy improved by using previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Lexical analysis further indicates that the approach promotes more confident and concise reasoning. This highlights the effectiveness and potential of this approach for improving LLM reasoning.", "affiliation": "a-m-team", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.19855/podcast.wav"}
