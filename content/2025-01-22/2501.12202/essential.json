Current automated approaches often struggle with creating high-resolution models with detailed textures and proper alignment to given conditions.  There is a need for an efficient and accessible system that addresses these issues. \n\nHunyuan3D 2.0 directly tackles this by introducing a two-stage generation pipeline.  **First, a large-scale shape generation model (Hunyuan3D-DiT) creates high-fidelity meshes aligned with condition images.** Then, a texture synthesis model (Hunyuan3D-Paint) generates vibrant, high-resolution texture maps for these meshes. The whole process is made easily accessible through a user-friendly platform, Hunyuan3D-Studio, enabling creation and manipulation of 3D assets efficiently. **Evaluations demonstrate that Hunyuan3D 2.0 outperforms existing methods**, significantly improving geometry details, condition alignment, and texture quality. The system is publicly released to promote open-source contributions to the field.", "affiliation": "Tencent AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2501.12202/podcast.wav"}
