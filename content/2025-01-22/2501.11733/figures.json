It surpasses previous state-of-the-art models on complex real-world tasks by separating high-level planning from low-level actions.  A key feature is its self-evolution module, which learns from past experiences to generate reusable \"Shortcuts\" (efficient action sequences) and general \"Tips\" (advice) that improve performance and efficiency. The figure illustrates the Mobile-Agent-E architecture and provides example task outputs.", "section": "1.

Decision-making at each step is disentangled into high-level planning by the Manager and low-level actions by the Operator. The Action Reflector verifies the outcome of each action, tracks progress, and provides error feedback. The Notetaker aggregates important information during navigation. A detailed example illustrating one step in the agent loop and the self-evolution process is presented in Figures\u00a03 and 4.", "description": "Mobile-Agent-E is a hierarchical multi-agent system.  The Manager creates high-level plans, breaking complex tasks into sub-tasks. The Perceptor (AP) processes visual information from the phone screen. The Operator (AO) executes low-level actions based on the Manager's plan and Perceptor's input. The Action Reflector (AR) monitors actions and provides feedback, while the Notetaker (AN) records crucial information. Two Experience Reflectors update the long-term memory (Tips and Shortcuts) which enable the system to learn from experience and improve its efficiency. Figures 3 and 4 provide a detailed illustration of this process.", "section": "2. Mobile-Agent-E"}]
