Many attention heads in FoX tend to forget quickly, leading to redundant computations. To address this inefficiency, the paper introduces Adaptive Computation Pruning (ACP), a method designed to dynamically prune computations that involve input-output dependencies heavily decayed by the forget gate. ACP is based on dynamically set pruning threshold, thus the pruned attention weights remain negligible.\n\nWith ACP, the method is applied to language model pretraining with Forgetting Transformer, and consistently reduces the number of FLOPs in softmax attention by around 70% across different model sizes and context lengths. This leads to a 10% to 35% improvement in training throughput. The longer the context lengths, the greater the computational savings. The speed improvements are achieved without any performance degradation. The method identifies and prunes computations in FlashAttention with a linear time complexity algorithm.", "affiliation": "Mila & Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.06949/podcast.wav"}
