Prior methods need human experts to label or leverage LLMs to detect errors, but remains costly due to the heavy reliance on manual annotation or the requirement of massive rollouts for accurate estimation. It needs a high-capability reasoning model and computational costs.\n\nThis paper proposes an active learning approach, ACTPRM, to address the limitations. ACTPRM proactively selects the most uncertain samples for training, substantially reducing labeling costs. During training, it estimates uncertainty after the forward pass and retains only highly uncertain data for labeling. Experimental results show that ACTPRM reduces 50% annotation. It advances actively trained PRM by filtering over 1M+ math reasoning trajectories with ACTPRM, retaining 60% of the data and achieving state-of-the-art(SOTA) PRM performance.", "affiliation": "National University of Singapore", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Active Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2504.10559/podcast.wav"}
