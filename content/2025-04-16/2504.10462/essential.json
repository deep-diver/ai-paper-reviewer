While effective, this paradigm is fragmented, increases complexity and may limit scalability. A promising alternative is to process raw image patches and text tokens within a single Transformer to enable end-to-end learning.\n\nThis paper introduces **SAIL**, a single transformer unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) that eliminates the need for a separate vision encoder. SAIL adapts mix-attention mechanisms and multimodal positional encodings to better align the visual and textual modalities. The result shows comparable performance to modular MLLMs, enhanced scalability, different cross-modal information flow and demonstrates strong visual representation capabilities. These properties surpass modular MLLMs in leveraging data, forming direct vision pathways and functioning as encoders.", "affiliation": "Bytedance Seed", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2504.10462/podcast.wav"}
