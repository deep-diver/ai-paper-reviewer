After an initial query, if the LLM's response is incorrect, it receives a reward for retrying with a new query. The process repeats until a correct answer is obtained. The reward increases with each retry, incentivizing persistence.  This contrasts with methods that only reward successful outcomes.", "section": "1 Introduction"}]
