It compares NormalCrafter's output to that of a state-of-the-art image normal estimator (Marigold-E2E-FT) on example video frames.  NormalCrafter's output shows significantly improved temporal consistency and higher spatial fidelity, maintaining detail and preventing flickering over time. The red lines and rectangles highlight the temporal consistency comparison between the two methods.", "section": "Introduction"}]
