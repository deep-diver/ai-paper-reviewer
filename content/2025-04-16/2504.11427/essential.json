Existing methods often struggle with flickering artifacts and lack fine-grained details. To address these issues, the paper introduces a method that leverages the inherent temporal priors of video diffusion models, but naively applying video diffusion models produces sub-optimal normal estimation.\n\nThe paper introduces **Semantic Feature Regularization (SFR)**, which aligns diffusion features with semantic cues to enhance spatial fidelity. To maintain long temporal context while preserving spatial accuracy, NormalCrafter uses a two-stage training protocol. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in generating temporally consistent normal sequences with intricate details, significantly outperforming existing approaches.", "affiliation": "The Hong Kong Polytechnic University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.11427/podcast.wav"}
