Frontier models and Humanity are compared across ten key skills.

Each axis represents a skill (Logical Reasoning, Memory Recall, Bluffing, Theory of Mind, Pattern Recognition, Spatial Thinking, Strategic Planning, Adaptability, Persuasion, and Uncertainty Estimation).  The length of each spoke indicates the relative proficiency of each model or humans in that particular skill.  The chart normalizes each skill separately making the relative comparisons easier. The full data with numerical scores is available on the leaderboard link provided in the paper.", "section": "ABSTRACT"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11442/extracted/6360905/prelim_results.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Preliminary model rankings for a subset of models and games. Game-play results are influenced by both the models\u2019 ability to play the games and their ability to understand the rules and format. For example, some reasoning models can sometimes reveal their cards or roles during game-play.", "description": "This figure displays the preliminary rankings of several large language models (LLMs) across a selection of TextArena games.  The ranking is determined by the models' performance in gameplay, but this performance is influenced by two factors: the model's inherent ability to play the specific game and its understanding of the game's rules. The figure highlights how even models strong in reasoning may sometimes inadvertently reveal information about their strategy (like showing their hand in a card game), impacting their final score.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2504.11442/extracted/6360905/TextArenaRender.jpg", "caption": "Figure 3: Images of some (rendered) TextArena environments.", "description": "Figure 3 showcases example screenshots of various game environments available within TextArena.  These environments are designed to test a wide range of cognitive and social skills in large language models, encompassing diverse gameplay mechanics and visual styles.
