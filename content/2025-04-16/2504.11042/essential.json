{"importance": "This paper is important because it addresses the critical issue of **lazy thinking in peer reviews**, contributing to the improvement of scientific publication quality. By providing a **high-quality annotated dataset**, it enables further research into automated detection methods.  It can also be used to **train junior reviewers** in the community. It also **opens avenues for exploring the impact of AI-generated reviews**.", "summary": "LAZYREVIEW: New dataset to reveal lazy thinking in NLP peer reviews, enhancing detection & quality!", "takeaways": ["LAZYREVIEW dataset is introduced for detecting lazy thinking instances in NLP peer reviews.", "The annotation guidelines are enhanced to improve annotation quality.", "Instruction tuning on the dataset significantly improves LLM performance in detecting lazy thinking."], "tldr": "Peer review in scientific publishing is crucial for quality control. But 'quick' heuristics, or **lazy thinking**, can compromise review quality due to increasing workload. Automating the detection of such heuristics can help improve the peer-reviewing process. This work introduces **LAZYREVIEW, a peer-review dataset** with fine-grained lazy thinking categories annotated, filling the gap of existing NLP research limitations on the issue. \n\nLAZYREVIEW is a dataset of peer-review sentences annotated with lazy thinking categories. **Large Language Models(LLMs) struggle in a zero-shot setting**, but instruction-based fine-tuning significantly boosts performance, highlighting the importance of high-quality training data.  Reviews revised with LAZYREVIEW feedback are more actionable. Releasing this dataset and enhanced guidelines can help in the community to train junior reviewers.", "affiliation": "Ubiquitous Knowledge Processing Lab, Department of Computer Science and Hessian Center for AI (hessian.AI), Technical University of Darmstadt", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Text Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2504.11042/podcast.wav"}
