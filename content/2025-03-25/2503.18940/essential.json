{"importance": "This paper presents a promising approach to **accelerate diffusion models** without compromising output quality or requiring retraining.  It's relevant to researchers working on **efficient generative models,** offering a practical solution for deploying diffusion models in **resource-constrained environments.** It opens new avenues for exploring resolution-aware inference techniques and optimizing diffusion models for various applications.", "summary": "Bottleneck Sampling: Accelerate diffusion models *without* retraining by cleverly using low-resolution priors for efficient inference!", "takeaways": ["Bottleneck Sampling, a novel training-free framework, significantly accelerates diffusion model inference by strategically incorporating low-resolution computations.", "The method maintains comparable output quality to standard full-resolution sampling, achieving up to 3x speedup for image generation and 2.5x for video generation.", "Bottleneck Sampling is versatile and can be applied to both image and video generation tasks, making it a practical acceleration strategy."], "tldr": "Diffusion models excel at visual content creation, but high computational costs hinder their use. The complexity of self-attention grows quadratically with image/video resolution. Current methods often sacrifice quality or need costly retraining. However, diffusion models are often pretrained at lower resolutions. The paper asks: Can we use low-resolution pretrained data to speed up high-resolution inference without losing quality?\n\nThe paper introduces **Bottleneck Sampling,** a training-free method that uses low-resolution priors to cut compute costs while keeping output quality high. It follows a high-low-high denoising process. It denoises at high-resolution initially and finally, but switches to lower resolutions in between. It refines resolution shifts and adapts denoising steps to avoid blurring. Experiments on image/video tasks show 3x/2.5x faster inference while matching standard quality.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18940/podcast.wav"}
