Traditional runtime optimizations like quantization and pruning have limitations, urging complementary approaches to improve efficiency while maintaining simplicity and scaling. Addressing the challenge, the paper introduces novel way to enhance LLM efficiency.\n\nThe study presents **FFN Fusion**, an optimization technique that reduces sequential computation in LLMs by parallelizing Feed-Forward Network(FFN) layers. By identifying opportunities for parallelization, FFN Fusion transforms sequential operations into parallel ones, reducing inference latency while preserving model behavior. The authors introduce **Ultra-253B-Base**, derived from Llama-3.1-405B, demonstrating significant speedups and strong performance.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18908/podcast.wav"}
