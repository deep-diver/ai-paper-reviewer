Existing solutions compromise efficiency or scalability. The core issue lies in how task decomposition affects synergies/conflicts between subtasks, motivating a principled framework that inherently aligns optimization targets across subtasks.\n\nThis paper presents an equivariant image modeling paradigm that minimizes inter-task conflicts. It uses **column-wise tokenization** to enhance translational symmetry and **windowed causal attention** for consistent contextual relationships. Experiments on ImageNet show performance comparable to state-of-the-art models with fewer resources. Analysis shows improved zero-shot generalization and ultra-long image synthesis.", "affiliation": "University of Science and Technology of China", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.18948/podcast.wav"}
