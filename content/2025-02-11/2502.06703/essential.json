This paper investigates Test-Time Scaling (TTS), a method that enhances performance by adding computation during inference. However, existing TTS research lacks a systematic analysis of how different factors influence the optimal scaling strategy. This makes it difficult to apply TTS effectively in practice and limits our understanding of its potential.\nThis research addresses this gap by conducting comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and AIME24 datasets. They explore the impact of various policy models, process reward models (PRMs), and problem difficulty levels on TTS. Their findings demonstrate that a compute-optimal TTS strategy, especially a reward-aware approach, significantly improves performance. Surprisingly, they find that **smaller LLMs, using their optimized TTS approach, can even outperform much larger models**.  This suggests a paradigm shift in how we think about LLM scaling.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06703/podcast.wav"}
