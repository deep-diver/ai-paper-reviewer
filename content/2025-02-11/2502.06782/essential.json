Existing Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), while successful in image generation, often struggle with the added complexities of video data, leading to inefficient models.  The high computational costs and limitations in controlling dynamic aspects are significant hurdles.\n\nLumina-Video addresses these challenges with a novel framework built upon a multi-scale Next-DiT architecture. This allows for efficient learning across different scales and resource allocation, improving efficiency and flexibility. The incorporation of motion scores as explicit conditions enables direct control of video dynamics.   Progressive training and a multi-source data strategy further enhance the model\u2019s performance and the quality of the generated videos.  Overall, Lumina-Video demonstrates superior performance and flexibility compared to existing methods.", "affiliation": "Chinese University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06782/podcast.wav"}
