This is primarily due to the complexity of 3D full attention mechanisms and numerous sampling steps. The research addresses these inefficiencies by proposing a new model called EFFICIENT-VDIT.  The slow inference is a major challenge hindering wider adoption of these models.\nEFFICIENT-VDIT tackles this problem by developing a novel family of sparse 3D attention mechanisms that exploit inherent redundancies in video data. This significantly reduces computational complexity, resulting in faster inference speeds. Moreover, the method integrates multi-step consistency distillation to shorten the sampling process, further improving the efficiency of video generation.  These combined techniques enable substantial acceleration of video generation, achieving up to a 7.8x speedup while maintaining comparable video quality. **The framework, built upon the analysis of Attention Tile patterns, shows improved data efficiency and is readily adaptable to distributed inference**, showcasing its effectiveness in practical applications.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06155/podcast.wav"}
