Current methods, such as reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization, often fall short due to dependence on task-specific rewards or precise models.  This necessitates a novel approach that can handle the intricacies of contact-rich scenarios and generalize across diverse objects and tasks. \nDexTrack addresses this challenge by leveraging a data-driven approach. It uses a large-scale dataset of human demonstrations paired with corresponding robot actions to train a neural tracking controller.  The approach further refines these demonstrations through an iterative process involving reinforcement and imitation learning.  This ensures both high quality and diversity of training data, enhancing the controller's ability to generalize across diverse manipulation tasks. Results show significant improvement over baselines in both simulated and real-world experiments, showcasing the generalizability, adaptability, and robustness of DexTrack.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Robotics"}, "podcast_path": "2502.09614/podcast.wav"}
