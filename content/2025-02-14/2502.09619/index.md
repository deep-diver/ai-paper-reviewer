### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Finding the right pre-trained model for a specific task is challenging due to the sheer number of available models and often insufficient documentation. Current model search methods primarily rely on text-based searches of metadata, which is often incomplete or inaccurate. This paper introduces ProbeLog, a novel method that directly analyzes model weights to identify suitable models for a given task, even without any prior knowledge of the model's purpose. 

ProbeLog uses a 'probing' approach, feeding a fixed set of inputs (probes) to the models and analyzing their outputs. It generates a unique descriptor for each output dimension (logit) of the model, allowing for efficient retrieval based on logit similarity.  Furthermore, to reduce the computational cost of analyzing massive model repositories, Collaborative Probing, a matrix factorization based method is introduced to effectively reduce the number of probes required for gallery encoding.  Experiments show ProbeLog achieves significantly higher retrieval accuracy compared to existing approaches, and demonstrates scalability to large repositories.

### In-depth insights


#### Weight-Space Search
Weight-space search represents a paradigm shift in model retrieval, moving beyond traditional text-based methods.  Instead of relying on often-sparse or inaccurate model documentation, it leverages the inherent information encoded within the model's weights. This approach offers the potential for **more accurate and comprehensive model discovery**, especially in scenarios with limited metadata. The challenge lies in the high dimensionality and complexity of weight spaces, requiring efficient and robust techniques to extract meaningful representations. **ProbeLog**, as presented in the paper, tackles this by focusing on logit-level descriptors, offering a scalable and effective method for both logit-based and zero-shot text-based retrieval. This allows for flexible querying, enabling researchers to find models based on desired functionality, regardless of the specific training data or model architecture.  **Collaborative probing** significantly improves efficiency by reducing the number of costly feedforward passes needed.  While still nascent, weight-space search holds immense promise for efficiently navigating the ever-expanding landscape of machine learning models, enabling easier discovery of pre-trained models suitable for various tasks and promoting broader accessibility of existing research.

#### ProbeLog Method
The ProbeLog method is a novel approach to zero-shot model search that analyzes model weights without relying on metadata or training data.  **Its core innovation is representing each output dimension (logit) of a model individually, creating a descriptor for each logit based on its responses to a fixed set of input probes.** This logit-level representation is crucial, as it addresses the limitations of model-level representations which are insensitive to specific target concepts and highly susceptible to variations in model structure or class order.  **ProbeLog leverages a collaborative filtering technique to reduce the computational cost of encoding large model repositories, achieving a 3x reduction in encoding time.** Additionally, **ProbeLog supports both logit-based and zero-shot text-based retrieval**, allowing users to find models based on similarity to existing logits or directly search using a textual concept description.  The method's strength lies in its ability to effectively handle poorly documented models which represent a majority of the models available in public repositories.  This is achieved by focusing on the functional properties revealed by the probing process rather than relying on often scarce or unreliable model descriptions.  Overall, ProbeLog demonstrates promising results in both real-world and fine-grained search tasks, making it a practical and scalable solution to the challenging problem of efficient model search within massive model repositories.

#### Zero-Shot Retrieval
Zero-shot retrieval, in the context of the research paper, signifies a model search technique **capable of identifying relevant models without relying on explicit training data or metadata**.  This is a significant advance over traditional methods which heavily depend on text-based searches of model documentation, often inaccurate and incomplete. The core idea revolves around creating a **robust model representation** derived from the model's weights or outputs, that captures its core functionality rather than relying on potentially scarce or misleading metadata. This representation allows the search to proceed based on functional similarity, leading to the possibility of identifying models suitable for a specific task even when information about those models is unavailable.  **The method's effectiveness hinges on the ability to accurately encode the essence of a model's task** through these representations, often requiring innovative approaches in representing and comparing model characteristics, such as logit-level descriptors.  **Scalability to large model repositories is paramount**, making efficient methods like collaborative filtering critical for practical deployment.

#### Collaborative Probing
The concept of 'Collaborative Probing' presented in the research paper offers a **highly efficient solution** to the computational cost associated with creating comprehensive representations of model repositories.  By strategically sampling only a subset of probes for each model and then leveraging matrix factorization techniques (like truncated SVD) to intelligently fill in the missing data, this method **significantly reduces the number of required forward passes**. This translates to **substantial computational savings** and improved scalability, making the proposed search technique applicable to much larger model repositories.  The **effectiveness of collaborative probing** is demonstrably shown through experimental results, highlighting its ability to achieve comparable accuracy to the full probing approach, despite using a much smaller fraction of probes. This makes it a **practical and vital component** of the overall methodology, rendering the approach more accessible and feasible for real-world applications.

#### Future of Model Search
The future of model search hinges on addressing the limitations of current methods.  **Moving beyond rudimentary keyword searches** requires leveraging model weights directly, as demonstrated by ProbeLog's success in retrieving models based on their functional capabilities rather than metadata.  **Logit-level representations**, as opposed to whole-model representations, offer a more granular and robust approach.  **Collaborative filtering techniques** will become crucial for efficiently managing the exponentially growing number of models, reducing the computational cost of searching massive repositories.  Further research should explore **more sophisticated probe selection methods**, perhaps using adaptive sampling to improve accuracy and efficiency.  Finally, **integrating text-based search seamlessly with weight-based search** is essential for truly zero-shot retrieval, enabling users to find appropriate models regardless of whether detailed documentation is available.  Developing effective **asymmetric discrepancy measures** capable of evaluating the match between text descriptions and model logit capabilities will be key to enabling these advancements.

Given a text prompt like 'Dog', the search aims to retrieve all classifiers that include 'Dog' as one of their classification classes.  The challenge lies in the massive size of the model repository and the diversity of concepts within it. Successful retrieval replaces the need for model training, offering potential improvements in accuracy, cost reduction, and environmental benefits.

Instead of running all probes through every model (which is computationally expensive), a random subset of probes is used for each model. This results in a sparse matrix of logit representations.  Matrix factorization (specifically, truncated SVD) is then employed to impute the missing values, effectively reconstructing the complete matrix of logit descriptors. This method significantly reduces the computational cost compared to probing all models with all probes, making the process more scalable for large repositories.

Despite this reduction, the figure shows that Collaborative Probing achieves comparable accuracy to the standard approach, often even doubling its accuracy for this limited probe regime.

> 🔼 This table presents an ablation study on the choice of probe datasets for the ProbeLog method.  The study compares the performance of using different probe datasets, both real-world datasets (ImageNet, Stable Diffusion) and synthetic datasets (Dead Leaves, COCO), for retrieving relevant model logits. The results show that using probes from datasets closer to the models' training data generally leads to better retrieval accuracy. However, even out-of-distribution probes sampled from the COCO dataset achieve surprisingly high accuracy, demonstrating the robustness of the proposed method.

> Table 2: Dataset Ablations. We compare both real and synthetic probe distributions. While distributions closer to the model’s training data lead to better results, even out-of-distribution probes sampled from the COCO dataset retrieve relevant logits with high accuracy.

> 🔼 This table presents an ablation study on the choice of discrepancy metric used in ProbeLog for comparing logit-level descriptors.  It investigates two key aspects: (i) the impact of normalizing logit descriptors before comparison, particularly for text-based search, and (ii) the effect of selecting only the most confident probes (those with the highest values) when calculating the discrepancy. The results demonstrate that normalizing logit descriptors is vital for good performance, especially for text-based searches, and that choosing the top-k most confident probes is far superior to other strategies. No other probe selection method achieved comparable accuracy.

> Table 3: Logit Discrepancy Ablations. Our evaluation reveals: i) normalizing logit descriptors is necessary for accurate retrieval, especially for search-by-text. ii) choosing the most confident probes of the query logit is crucial, no other approach achieved comparable accuracy.

> 🔼 Table 4 presents a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed ProbeLog method and baseline approaches for model retrieval. It shows the top-1 and top-5 retrieval accuracy and precision across different scenarios: INet-to-INet (models from the same distribution), INet-to-HF (models from different distributions), HF-to-INet (models from different distributions), text-to-INet, and text-to-HF.  The results highlight the superior performance of ProbeLog in all scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in retrieving relevant models even when the query and model repositories originate from different distributions or when using zero-shot text-based search. All experiments use COCO images as probes, ensuring consistent evaluation.
