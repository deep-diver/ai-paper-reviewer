This paper introduces a solution by creating 3CAD, a large-scale, real-world dataset of 3C products with diverse anomalies.  The images in 3CAD have pixel-level anomaly labels and contain multiple anomaly types per image. \nTo handle the challenges posed by 3CAD, this paper also proposes a new anomaly detection framework called CFRG (Coarse-to-Fine detection paradigm with Recovery Guidance). CFRG uses a coarse-to-fine approach, leveraging heterogeneous distillation for coarse localization followed by fine localization via segmentation and a recovery network to better capture normal patterns. Experiments on 3CAD and benchmark datasets show that CFRG is competitive and provides a significant improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods.  The availability of this challenging dataset will foster future research in unsupervised anomaly detection and encourage more robust solutions.
