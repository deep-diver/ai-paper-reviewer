However, existing methods struggle with complex mathematical reasoning tasks and can even degrade performance. There are two main limitations in the framework: (a) algorithm can't provide fine-grained rewards for reasoning tasks; (b) hard to design criterion for complex solution to get scores. \n\nThis paper introduces **Process-based Self-Rewarding Language Models**, incorporating step-wise LLM-as-a-Judge and preference optimization. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by enabling fine-grained evaluation of reasoning steps and step-wise preference optimization using the model itself as a reward model. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate enhanced performance and potential for superhuman reasoning.", "affiliation": "Nanjing University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2503.03746/podcast.wav"}
