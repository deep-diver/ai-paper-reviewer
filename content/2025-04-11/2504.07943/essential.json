This paper introduces 3D part amodal segmentation, which decomposes 3D shapes into complete semantic parts, even when occluded. This task is challenging because it requires inferring occluded geometry, maintaining shape consistency, and generalizing to diverse shapes with limited data.\n\nThis paper presents HoloPart, a novel diffusion-based model for 3D part shape completion. It leverages a 3D generative prior and adapts it to part completion using a curated dataset. HoloPart incorporates local attention for fine-grained details and shape context-aware attention for overall consistency. The authors introduce new benchmarks and demonstrate that HoloPart significantly outperforms existing methods. By integrating HoloPart with existing segmentation techniques, promising results are achieved on 3D part amodal segmentation, **opening new avenues for applications in geometry editing and animation**.", "affiliation": "University of Hong Kong", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.07943/podcast.wav"}
