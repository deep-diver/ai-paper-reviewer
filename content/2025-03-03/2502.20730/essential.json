The Long-form QA or Multi-hop QA focused on assembling knowledge fragments, missing the demands of complete solutions. The goal of automatically generate reliable solutions for these complex requirements remains unmet and necessitates new approaches and benchmarks to measure progress in this area. \n\nThis paper introduces SolutionBench, a new benchmark, to tackle the challenge, evaluating systems in generating complete solutions for complex engineering requirements. **The study also presents SolutionRAG, a novel system with tree-based exploration and bi-point thinking to generate reliable solutions.** Experimental results on SolutionBench show SolutionRAG outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance.
