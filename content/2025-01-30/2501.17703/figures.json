The figure showcases the effectiveness of CFT in improving model performance on different mathematical reasoning benchmarks.  Three variants of SFT are shown:  one trained on responses verified by GPT-40 (\"SFT-verified\"), one trained directly on GPT-40's generated responses (\"SFT-GPT40\"), and a baseline SFT model. In contrast, CFT trains the model using critiques of noisy responses, also generated by GPT-40.  The results demonstrate that CFT achieves consistently better performance than the SFT approaches across various benchmarks.", "section": "Abstract"}]
