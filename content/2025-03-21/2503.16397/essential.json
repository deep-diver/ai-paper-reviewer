Existing acceleration methods often reduce sampling steps while overlooking data dimensionality. Recent work on next-scale prediction shows promise through gradually increasing resolution, resembling human perception. DMs still operate at a fixed dimensionality, leaving efficiency improvements unexplored. Therefore, a more effective approach to balance computational cost and performance is needed.\n\nThis paper introduces Scale-wise Distillation (SWD), a framework that generates images scale-by-scale across the diffusion process. **SWD integrates into existing distillation methods and introduces a patch loss for finer similarity.** Applied to text-to-image DMs, SWD achieves inference times of two full-resolution steps and outperforms counterparts with the same computation.  It also competes or surpasses current text-to-image DMs with 2.5x-10x speed increase.", "affiliation": "Yandex Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16397/podcast.wav"}
