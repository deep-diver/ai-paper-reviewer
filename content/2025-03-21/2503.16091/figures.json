The data flow begins with sensor data and event data being processed. The processed data, along with knowledge features, is fed into the LSTM model which then outputs a prediction for the next hour's medication event.

It starts with raw sensor data and event data (medication taken or missed) collected from individual users. The data is then processed to add more features like contextual information (day of week, time of day), and derived features. This enriched dataset is then split into training and testing datasets, with 90% of the data used for training and the remaining 10% for testing the prediction model.  The training data is further processed using a sliding window technique to create multiple instances for model training.", "section": "3.
