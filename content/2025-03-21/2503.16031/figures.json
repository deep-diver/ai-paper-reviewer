It starts with gathering fake claims from various fact-checking websites. These claims are then fed into a structured prompt for the ChatGPT-40 model, which generates humorous comments in multiple languages (including code-mixed variations).  Human reviewers then evaluate and refine these comments, ensuring quality and appropriateness before labeling them with satire level (1-3) and humor attributes (Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay, Absurdity). This process creates a diverse and controlled dataset ready for research.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.16031/extracted/6295706/figures/Satire_vs_Humor_Attribute.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Satire Level vs Humor Attribute. The color intensity represents the frequency distribution across datasets.", "description": "This figure displays heatmaps visualizing the relationship between satire level (low, medium, high) and humor attribute (Absurdity, Dark Humor, Irony, Social Commentary, Wordplay) across three datasets: training, validation, and testing.  The color intensity in each cell of the heatmap corresponds to the frequency of comments exhibiting that specific combination of satire level and humor attribute within the dataset. Darker colors indicate higher frequency. This allows for a visual analysis of the distribution of different humor types across varying satire levels and how the proportions change between the training, validation and test sets.", "section": "3.3 Dataset Description"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.16031/extracted/6295706/figures/Lang_Varients_vs_Satire_Level.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Language Variants vs Humor Attribute. The heatmap highlights humor variations across languages.", "description": "This heatmap visualizes how different humor attributes (Irony, Absurdity, Social Commentary, Dark Humor, Wordplay) are distributed across various languages (English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed versions).  The intensity of color in each cell represents the frequency of a particular humor attribute within a given language.  This allows for a comparison of humor styles and preferences across different linguistic groups and helps understand the linguistic nuances in expressing humor within those groups.

Each heatmap represents a different dataset split (train, validation, test).  The x-axis represents satire levels (low, medium, high), and the y-axis shows the languages used (English, Telugu, Hindi, Kannada, Tamil, and their code-mixed variants). The color intensity of each cell reflects the frequency of comments in that language category at that particular satire level.  Darker colors indicate higher frequencies. This helps illustrate whether certain languages tend to be associated with different satire levels in the dataset.", "section": "3.3 Dataset Description"}]
