Current methods struggle with accurately capturing scenes due to the difficulty of jointly modeling camera poses and images. While some approaches fine-tune 2D generative models, they often face instability and modality gaps. This requires external models and refinement steps to stabilize training and inference, adding complexity and hindering seamless integration. These limitations impact the quality and efficiency of 3D scene generation, especially for unbounded real-world environments.\n\nTo tackle these issues, this paper introduces a dual-stream architecture. A dedicated pose generation model is attached alongside a pre-trained video generation model, with communication blocks. Asynchronous sampling denoises poses faster than images. It ensures cross-modal consistency, all while reducing mutual ambiguity. The model outperforms existing direct generation methods that depend on post-hoc refinement. It achieves superior results without these refinements. The results confirm the design approach to 3D generation.", "affiliation": "EverEx", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15855/podcast.wav"}
