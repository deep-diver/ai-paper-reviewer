By reversing the typical strategy of faster pose denoising, the results show a significant decline in image quality and scene coherence. This highlights the importance of the chosen denoising order for stable and high-quality 3D scene generation.", "section": "C.

Each method is used to generate 3D scenes from the same text prompts.  The generated scenes from each method are visually compared to highlight the differences in realism and detail. Notably, VideoRFSplat produces more realistic scenes without needing a post-processing refinement step called SDS++, unlike the other two methods. This demonstrates that VideoRFSplat's direct generation approach is superior in terms of visual quality.", "section": "5.
