Existing methods for detecting hallucinations either rely heavily on internal knowledge or involve complex, multi-step processes. This leads to limitations in low-resource languages and potential inaccuracies in aligning modified responses with the original LLM output. These challenges underscore the need for effective hallucination detection to ensure the development of safe and trustworthy AI.\n\nTo address these challenges, this paper introduces REFIND, a novel framework for detecting hallucinated spans by directly leveraging retrieved documents. **REFIND quantifies the context sensitivity of each token** using a novel Context Sensitivity Ratio (CSR). The method measures the token's dependence on external contextual information. REFIND achieves high accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating robustness across nine languages and outperforming baseline models.", "affiliation": "Pohang University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.13622/podcast.wav"}
