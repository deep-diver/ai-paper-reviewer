[{"heading_title": "Creative MLLM Gap", "details": {"summary": "The under-explored domain of creative capabilities in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), compared to LLMs, represents a significant 'Creative MLLM Gap'. Current benchmarks inadequately assess **visual-creative intelligence**, especially in real-world, image-based tasks. **Addressing this gap is crucial**, as creativity, involving novel and appropriate solutions, is a fundamental aspect of intelligence. Existing benchmarks often feature simplistic questions, failing to challenge MLLMs in complex, real-life scenarios that demand broader cognitive abilities. The benchmarks lag significantly behind those conducted for LLMs. Assessing visual creativity requires benchmarks encompassing a range of cognitive abilities **Visual fine-tuning can negatively impact the base LLM's creative abilities**. Therefore, **dedicated benchmarks** that evaluate the integration of visual perception with creative expression are essential for advancing MLLM capabilities in this domain."}}, {"heading_title": "Real-world Vision", "details": {"summary": "**Real-world vision** in MLLMs highlights the critical need for models to effectively translate visual inputs into creative outputs. This involves nuanced understanding, **factual consistency**, and the ability to generate contextually appropriate responses. **Creativity benchmarks** specifically designed help evaluate models for their real-world application. **Models face challenges** to maintain creativity while staying aligned with visual details, and the exploration of trade-offs becomes essential. Visual tuning affects creative abilities, understanding the necessity of the model."}}, {"heading_title": "Instance Criteria", "details": {"summary": "**Instance-specific criteria** are pivotal for MLLM evaluation, offering granular assessment of responses tailored to each unique test case.  Unlike generic benchmarks, **defining unique criteria** ensures effective integration of visual and contextual cues. This tailored approach is vital for complex, creative tasks where a single evaluation model falls short.  By assessing both general response quality and factual consistency, these criteria enable a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the model's proficiency. Crafting **detailed instructions** that consider the subtleties of individual tasks yields a more reliable and insightful evaluation, surpassing the limitations of one-size-fits-all metrics.  These criteria provide a robust framework for advancing multimodal generative intelligence."}}, {"heading_title": "Visual hurts LLM?", "details": {"summary": "**Visual fine-tuning's impact on LLMs is complex.** While enhancing multimodal capabilities, it can **negatively affect the base LLM's creative abilities**, indicating a trade-off. The study's findings suggest that visual training, designed to improve perception, might constrain the LLM's original strength in text-based creative tasks. This implies that LLMs might **over specialize during visual instruction tuning**, losing the inherent ability to diverge in creative tasks. **Careful tuning strategies** are needed to mitigate such losses, ensuring multimodal LLMs **retain robust creativity alongside enhanced visual understanding.** Further research on LLM could be crucial"}}, {"heading_title": "For Generative AI", "details": {"summary": "Assessing creative intelligence in multimodal models (**MLLMs**) opens intriguing avenues for generative AI. Unlike discriminative tasks, where models identify patterns, generative AI demands **novel content creation** aligned with context and constraints. Benchmarks like Creation-MMBench, focusing on visual-creative tasks, are vital. They push MLLMs beyond recognition to **imaginative applications** like story writing or design generation. A key challenge lies in **evaluation**: assessing not just accuracy, but originality and contextual fit. This necessitates new metrics and judge models adept at subjective assessment. By tackling this, we enhance generative AI's potential for creative problem-solving and innovative expression."}}]
