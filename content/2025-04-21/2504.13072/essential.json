{"importance": "This paper introduces a novel hierarchical framework that enhances scene-level 3D creation, offering new possibilities for interactive editing and simulation. By creating more realistic virtual environments, the study can significantly impact AR/VR development and virtual content creation. It also opens avenues for future work on PBR textures and generative models.", "summary": "HiScene bridges 2D image generation and 3D object creation for high-fidelity, editable 3D scenes with natural layouts, leveraging isometric views for compositional hierarchy.", "takeaways": ["Scenes can be effectively treated as hierarchical objects under isometric views, facilitating a novel approach to 3D scene generation.", "Video-diffusion-based amodal completion effectively addresses occlusions and shadows, enhancing object refinement.", "Spatial alignment mechanisms with shape prior injection ensure coherence and plausibility in generated 3D scenes."], "tldr": "Existing 3D scene generation methods suffer from limited object categories and editing flexibility. To address these issues, the paper presents a novel hierarchical framework. The framework aims to bridge the gap between 2D image and 3D object generation, delivering high-fidelity scenes with compositional identities and aesthetic content. It treats scenes as hierarchical objects under isometric views, enabling generation of 3D content that aligns with 2D representations while maintaining structure.\n\nThe core of the method involves a video-diffusion-based amodal completion technique to handle occlusions and shadows, and shape prior injection to ensure spatial coherence. Through hierarchical parsing and spatial alignment mechanisms, the method can generate complete 3D instances suitable for interactive applications, as well as maintaining physical plausibility. The paper introduces more natural object arrangements. Experimental results demonstrate that the method outperforms existing methods.", "affiliation": "Zhejiang University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2504.13072/podcast.wav"}
