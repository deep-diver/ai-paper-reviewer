Existing methods focus on denoising directions. This paper addresses the principled design of stepsize schedules. The authors propose a dynamic programming framework to derive optimal schedules by distilling knowledge from reference trajectories. This tackles computational intensity.\n\nThe paper introduces Optimal Stepsize Distillation, reformulating stepsize optimization as recursive error minimization. This method guarantees discretization bounds through optimal substructure exploitation. The distilled schedules show robustness across architectures, ODE solvers, and noise schedules.
