This leads to scenarios where generated videos appear visually plausible but are physically nonsensical. Existing models lack a deep understanding of physics, hindering their application in domains such as robotics and autonomous driving. To address this gap, researchers are exploring methods to incorporate physical knowledge into generative models, aiming to create more realistic and reliable simulations. The key challenge is how to effectively embed physical rules and constraints into the learning process, enabling models to reason about and predict the behavior of objects in dynamic environments.\n\nThis survey offers a comprehensive overview of the evolution of physical cognition in video generation, categorizing approaches into three tiers: basic schema perception, passive cognition of physical knowledge, and active cognition for world simulation. It examines various techniques, including motion-guided generation, physics-inspired regularization, and the use of physics simulators. The survey also discusses existing benchmarks and metrics for evaluating physical plausibility and highlights key challenges and future research directions, such as constructing large foundational physics models and addressing the Sim2Real gap.", "affiliation": "Huazhong University of Science and Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21765/podcast.wav"}
