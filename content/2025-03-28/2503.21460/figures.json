It's structured around four interconnected dimensions: Agent Methodology (construction, collaboration, and evolution), Evaluation and Tools (benchmarks, assessment frameworks, development tools), Real-World Issues (security, privacy, and social impact), and Applications (diverse domains of LLM agent deployment). This framework helps in understanding the entire lifecycle of modern LLM-based agent systems, from their initial design and development to their real-world application and the challenges they present.", "section": "1 INTRODUCTION"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.21460/x2.png", "caption": "Figure 2: A taxonomy of large language model agent methodologies.", "description": "This figure presents a taxonomy that categorizes the methodologies used in creating large language model (LLM) agents. It's structured into three main sections: Agent Construction, Agent Collaboration, and Agent Evolution.  Each section further breaks down into sub-categories detailing different approaches and techniques used within each stage of agent development. This taxonomy helps to illustrate the different paths researchers and developers take when designing LLM agents, from basic profile definitions to sophisticated multi-agent collaboration mechanisms and strategies for long-term adaptation and improvement.", "section": "2 Agent Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.21460/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 3: An overview of evaluation benchmarks and tools for LLM agents.

The figure is divided into two main sections. The left section categorizes various evaluation frameworks based on their scope and focus, including general assessment, domain-specific evaluations, and collaboration-based evaluations. This helps researchers and practitioners understand the different aspects of LLM agent performance and choose the most suitable methods for their specific needs. The right section showcases the various types of tools involved in the LLM agent ecosystem. These include tools utilized by LLM agents during task execution, tools created by LLM agents to extend functionality, and tools required for deploying, managing, and maintaining LLM agents in practical applications.", "section": "3 EVALUATION AND TOOLS"}]
