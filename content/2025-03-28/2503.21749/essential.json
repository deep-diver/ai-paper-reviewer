{"importance": "This paper introduces a new way to generate high-quality text images, which could significantly improve the design process and open new research directions for text-to-image generation. By focusing on **data quality and model training**, the authors provide a scalable solution that could inspire further advancements in the field.", "summary": "LeX-Art: High-quality text-to-image generation via scalable data synthesis.", "takeaways": ["Introduces LeX-Art, a comprehensive framework for high-quality text-image synthesis.", "Presents LeX-10K, a dataset of 10K high-resolution, aesthetically refined images.", "Achieves state-of-the-art text rendering performance with LeX-FLUX and LeX-Lumina."], "tldr": "Text-to-image models often struggle with accurately rendering text and integrating it seamlessly into images. While accuracy has been a focus, the aesthetic quality & integration with image content have been overlooked. Existing datasets lack high-quality samples for training models to produce diverse, aesthetically pleasing results. Thus, the paper explores these challenges in visual text generation.\n\nThe paper introduces **LeX-Art, a framework for high-quality text-image synthesis**. This includes the LeX-10K dataset, created using DeepSeek-R1 for prompt refinement and multi-stage filtering. Additionally, the paper provides LeX-Enhancer prompt enrichment and two text-to-image models, LeX-FLUX & LeX-Lumina. The benchmark LeX-Bench & a new metric, PNED, are introduced for evaluation, demonstrating significant improvements.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Laboratory", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.21749/podcast.wav"}
