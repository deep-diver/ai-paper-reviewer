### TL;DR


{{< lead >}}

Current AI benchmarks predominantly focus on English, limiting insights into low-resource languages like Korean. Many benchmarks don't compare AI performance to humans, hindering accurate AI proficiency measurement. Some benchmarks lack real-world application scenarios, limiting MLLM applicability. These limitations highlight the need for new evaluation resources.



This paper introduces KoNET, a benchmark dataset leveraging four Korean educational tests. The exams have rigorous standards and diverse questions. This helps with AI performance analysis across education levels. The assessment of a range of models uncover difficulties, subject diversity, and human error rates.  The dataset builder will be open-sourced.

### In-depth insights


#### Korean AI tests
**KoNET**, a novel benchmark, addresses the gap in evaluating multimodal AI systems using Korean educational standards. It comprises four exams: **KoEGED, KoMGED, KoHGED, and KOCSAT**, each renowned for rigor and diverse questions, enabling comprehensive AI performance analysis across educational levels. By focusing on Korean, KoNET sheds light on model performance in less-explored languages.  The **benchmark allows direct comparison of AI with human performance** given human error rates in dataset, underscoring crucial competencies for AI-driven educational technologies and real-world applicability.

#### KoNET analysis
**KoNET analysis** involves a multifaceted approach to assess AI's capabilities in the Korean educational context. It includes evaluating AI performance against human benchmarks using error rates, offering insights into AI's strengths and limitations in Korean educational content. It also includes an analysis of the performance differences between LLMs and MLLMs and demonstrates how many of the public models may underperform closed source models when unsupported by Korean OCR or if MLLMs are less effective in processing non-English contexts. Further, it evaluates the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge approach and highlights its consistency. Finally, it explores the multilingual capabilities, revealing that Open Source models may show limited multilingual support than Closed Source, offering a comprehensive view.

#### Model error rates
**Model error rates** are pivotal for understanding AI limitations relative to human performance. Analyzing these rates across diverse subjects reveals strengths/weaknesses in AI comprehension. **Lower error rates** in simpler comprehension imply AI excels in straightforward tasks, while **higher error rates** in complex reasoning mirror cognitive load challenges. Such analysis enhances model development towards nuanced understanding, potentially mimicking human-like error patterns in specific domains. Closed-source models, while often superior, still exhibit distinct error distributions, underscoring the need for tailored open-source development. This offers valuable insights to better align AI with human cognition.

#### OCR's Impact
**Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** has a profound impact on AI, especially in multimodal learning. **By enabling AI to 'see' and understand text within images**, OCR unlocks capabilities like processing scanned documents or extracting data from infographics. **This textual information becomes crucial for MLLMs**, augmenting visual cues. Without reliable OCR, MLLMs are limited to visual understanding, hindering comprehensive reasoning. **The quality of OCR directly affects MLLM's accuracy**; poor OCR leads to misinterpretations and incorrect conclusions. Further optimization of OCR, particularly for diverse languages and fonts, is crucial for enhancing the overall performance and applicability of multimodal AI systems across various domains. The development and integration of efficient OCR are necessary to support more reliable AI.

#### Beyond English AI
The phrase "Beyond English AI" highlights the crucial need to broaden the scope of AI development and evaluation beyond the dominant English-centric perspective.  **Current AI benchmarks and datasets heavily favor English, leading to skewed performance metrics and potentially overlooking biases** that may exist in other languages and cultural contexts.  Addressing this requires **creating and utilizing datasets in diverse languages**, like Korean as exemplified in the research paper, to rigorously assess AI capabilities across different linguistic landscapes. This also entails **developing models specifically tuned for these languages**, accounting for unique grammatical structures, cultural nuances, and regional variations. Furthermore, **incorporating human error data** from diverse populations becomes essential for ensuring AI systems generalize effectively and exhibit fair and equitable performance across different user groups. Ultimately, a focus on "Beyond English AI" is pivotal for building inclusive and globally relevant AI technologies.
