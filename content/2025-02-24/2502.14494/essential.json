{"importance": "This paper introduces **a novel benchmark, StructFlowBench**, which incorporates a multi-turn structural flow framework for instruction-following tasks. The benchmark addresses the critical gap in current evaluation methods by emphasizing the structural dependency between dialogue turns, moving beyond simple constraint satisfaction. It encourages researchers to develop more contextually aware and structurally coherent dialogue systems. The systematic evaluation of various LLMs provides valuable insights for optimizing dialogue systems and advancing research in human-AI interaction.", "summary": "Current LLM evaluation benchmarks often overlook the structural dependencies in multi-turn dialogues, treating them as simple concatenations of single-turn interactions. This approach neglects user intent and the logical flow crucial in real-world conversations, leading to limitations in capturing complex scenarios and introducing methodological biases.", "takeaways": ["Introduces StructFlowBench, a new benchmark for multi-turn instruction following with structural flow modeling.", "Defines a structural flow framework comprising six fundamental inter-turn relationships.", "Reveals significant deficiencies in current models' comprehension of multi-turn dialogue structures through systematic evaluations."], "tldr": "Existing LLM evaluation focuses on constraint satisfaction, overlooking structural dependency between dialogue turns. This results in a failure to model complex real-world scenarios and methodological biases, which impacts the coherence and analytical depth of dialogue systems. \n\nTo address these limitations, this paper introduces **StructFlowBench**, a multi-turn benchmark with structural flow modeling, including 6 inter-turn relationships. The study systematically evaluates 13 LLMs to reveal deficiencies in understanding dialogue structures, offering insights for improving multi-turn instruction following.", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence, Jilin University", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Dialogue Systems"}, "podcast_path": "2502.14494/podcast.wav"}
