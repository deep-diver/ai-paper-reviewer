However, automating this process is challenging due to the need for seamless integration of elements, preservation of background consistency, and efficient style acquisition from limited data. Prevailing image editing methods fall short due to their focus on global style transfer or pixel-perfect user-defined masks, creating a gap in addressing the challenges. \n\nTo address these issues, this paper introduces **PhotoDoodle**, an image editing framework designed to **learn artistic image editing from few-shot examples**. This method employs a two-stage training pipeline with EditLoRA and introduces a **PE Cloning strategy** to **enforce strict background consistency** through implicit feature alignment, facilitating precise and style-conscious decorative generation. Additionally, the authors provide a dedicated photo-doodle dataset.
