Existing methods either focus on single timesteps (neglecting trajectory-level alignment) or incur high computational costs. This paper introduces Diffusion-Sharpening, a new fine-tuning approach that directly optimizes the entire sampling trajectory during training. This is achieved using a path integral framework that leverages reward feedback and amortizes inference costs.\nDiffusion-Sharpening boasts superior training efficiency (faster convergence) and best inference efficiency (no extra NFEs).  Experiments across various metrics (text alignment, compositional abilities, user preferences) demonstrate that Diffusion-Sharpening surpasses existing RL-based fine-tuning and sampling trajectory optimization methods.  The method's efficiency and scalability make it highly suitable for fine-tuning large diffusion models.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.12146/podcast.wav"}
