Current methods for detecting these biases primarily focus on overall performance and data distribution, but they often overlook the internal workings of the model. This can result in an incomplete understanding of how biases are formed and propagated.  \n\nThe paper introduces the **Attention-IoU metric**, which uses attention maps to reveal biases within a model's internal representations. By comparing these maps with ground-truth feature masks or attention maps of other attributes, Attention-IoU quantifies how a model relies on specific image regions. This allows for the identification of **spurious correlations and potential confounding variables**, leading to more effective debiasing techniques.The metric is validated through the use of the synthetic Waterbirds dataset as well as the popular CelebA dataset.", "affiliation": "Princeton University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Classification"}, "podcast_path": "2503.19846/podcast.wav"}
