This leads to complexity and reduced trajectory quality, hindering the development of robust end-to-end systems. Recent diffusion-based approaches, while promising, often suffer from trajectory divergence, requiring complex scoring mechanisms and HD maps, which are difficult to obtain in all environments. These limitations underscore the need for improved methods that can effectively constrain trajectory generation and enhance overall system reliability.\n\nThe paper introduces **GoalFlow**, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process using **goal-driven flow matching**. GoalFlow consists of perception module, goal point construction module, and trajectory planning module. This approach uses a scoring mechanism to select the best goal point from candidate points, based on scene information, and employs flow matching for efficient multimodal trajectory generation. Experimental results on the Navsim dataset demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories. It is significantly surpassing existing methods, while requiring only a single denoising step for excellent performance.", "affiliation": "School of Artificial Intelligence, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Autonomous Vehicles"}, "podcast_path": "2503.05689/podcast.wav"}
