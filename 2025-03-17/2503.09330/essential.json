Previous approaches assume uniform forget data distribution; however, performance degrades for dominant groups when this doesn't hold, leading to fairness issues. This paper addresses this by presenting **group-robust machine unlearning** to tackle the overlooked problem of non-uniformly distributed forget sets. \n\nThe paper presents a simple strategy that mitigates performance loss in dominant groups via **sample distribution reweighting**. It also introduces **MIU**, the first approach for group robustness in approximate machine unlearning, minimizing the mutual information between model features and group information. It also exploits sample distribution reweighting and mutual information calibration to preserve group robustness.", "affiliation": "University of Trento", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Theory", "sub_category": "Robustness"}, "podcast_path": "2503.09330/podcast.wav"}
