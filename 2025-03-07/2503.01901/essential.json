Post-training quantization (PTQ) helps by compressing LLMs but relies on sensitivity metrics to identify important weights. Existing metrics are inaccurate due to the LLM\u2019s complicated loss landscape. They underestimate the impact of quantization, as the quantized weights fall outside the convergence radius. Moreover, the sensitivity might change after quantization.\n\nTo solve these issues, this work introduces Post-quantization Integral (**PQI**), a new sensitivity metric that accurately estimates the influence of each quantized weight. PQI considers both original and quantized weights. The research also proposes ReQuant, a framework with two components: outlier selection and step-wise significant weights detach. Experiments show ReQuant improves PTQ, enhancing perplexity gain on Llama 3.2 1B with QTIP.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.01901/podcast.wav"}
