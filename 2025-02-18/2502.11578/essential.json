{"importance": "This paper is important as it proposes a novel zero-shot proxy for evaluating LLMs using language complexity metrics. This method is **cost-effective and avoids the need for extensive benchmark datasets**, offering a practical approach for researchers and developers. Its findings also shed light on the relationship between language complexity and overall LLM capabilities, paving the way for future research on more efficient and effective LLM evaluation methods. The study also highlights the **limitations of LLMs in mathematical and analytical tasks**, demonstrating the need for further advancements in these areas.", "summary": "LLMs' performance on language complexity tasks (LIX & ADD) reveals a strong correlation with general capabilities, suggesting complexity metrics as noisy zero-shot proxies for model evaluation.", "takeaways": ["Language complexity measurement (LIX and ADD) can serve as a noisy zero-shot proxy for evaluating LLM performance.", "A strong correlation exists between LLMs' accuracy in calculating LIX and their overall performance on the MMLU benchmark.", "ChatGPT-01-mini shows the most consistent performance in both LIX computation and dependency parsing."], "tldr": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly advancing, but their capabilities in mathematical and analytical tasks remain a challenge. This paper explores LLMs' performance in language complexity measurement, specifically using the LIX readability metric and Average Dependency Distance (ADD). It evaluates six state-of-the-art LLMs on these tasks using Swedish essays, comparing their results to ground truths. \nThe study reveals that while all LLMs demonstrate some capacity for these tasks, ChatGPT-01-mini performs most consistently, achieving the highest accuracy.  Importantly, a significant negative correlation is found between models' accuracy in computing LIX and their overall performance on the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. This suggests that language complexity measurement abilities can serve as **noisy zero-shot proxies for assessing the general capabilities of LLMs**, offering a more efficient model evaluation method.", "affiliation": "KTH Royal Institute of Technology", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.11578/podcast.wav"}
