Existing methods often focus on specific tasks like solving mathematical problems or analyzing images, neglecting the broader applications of video understanding. Moreover, creating high-quality datasets for multimodal reasoning is challenging. \nThis research introduces video-SALMONN-01, the first open-source reasoning-enhanced audio-visual LLM designed for general video understanding.  To address the issue of dataset scarcity, they created a new reasoning-intensive dataset with step-by-step solutions.  They also developed a novel optimization technique, pDPO, that efficiently models step-level rewards for multimodal inputs.  Their model outperforms existing baselines on various video reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach.  Furthermore, RivaBench, a new benchmark dataset, was created to facilitate future research in this area.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.11775/podcast.wav"}
