There's a lack of evaluation in mismatched or contradictory info, a common real-world occurrence. To solve this, the paper introduces **Multimodal Inconsistency Reasoning (MMIR)** benchmark. It evaluates how effectively MLLMs identify semantic mismatches within layout-rich artifacts like webpages or slides. \n\n**MMIR** has 534 challenging samples with synthetic errors across five categories. Experiments on 6 MLLMs revealed models struggle, especially with cross-modal conflicts. The paper provides detailed error analyses based on category, modality and layout complexity. Probing experiments showed prompting yields marginal gains, revealing a bottleneck in cross-modal reasoning. This highlights the need for advanced reasoning, paving the way for inconsistency research.", "affiliation": "University of California, Santa Cruz", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.16033/podcast.wav"}
