{"importance": "The study introduces **MONSTER**, a large time-series dataset, to push for scalability & broader model relevance. This tackles current benchmarks' limitations and inspires impactful, real-world research.", "summary": "MONSTER: Large datasets for time series classification!", "takeaways": ["MONSTER, a new large-scale time series benchmark, is introduced.", "Current benchmarks favor low-variance models, limiting real-world applicability.", "Larger datasets select for computationally efficient and scalable methods."], "tldr": "The UCR and UEA archives have been instrumental in time series classification, yet their datasets are notably small. This favors models optimized for variance minimization, potentially hindering the discovery of solutions applicable to large-scale, real-world data. Current benchmarks may not fully represent the theoretical or practical challenges inherent in larger, more complex datasets. \n\nTo address this, MONSTER(Monash Scalable Time Series Evaluation Repository)\u2014a collection of large univariate and multivariate datasets was created. The goal is to diversify the research landscape, encouraging methods suited for larger datasets and inspiring the exploration of learning from extensive data quantities. Preliminary baseline results for selected methods are also provided.", "affiliation": "Monash University", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Deep Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2502.15122/podcast.wav"}
