A math problem and two candidate solutions are input. The Pairwise RM compares them, determining correctness. Incorrect solutions are eliminated iteratively until only one remains, which is deemed the best solution. The example shows the process, highlighting how pairwise comparisons lead to the elimination of an incorrect response.", "section": "3 Pairwise Reward Model and Knockout"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.13007/x4.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Comparsion between Process RM, Outcome RM and Pairwise RM on the different difficulty percentile of the MATH-500, generated by (a) LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instr and (b) LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instr respectively. The Process RM and Outcome RM here are EurusRM-7B and RLHFlow-8B-DS-Data, respectively.

The results are shown separately for models generating solutions using LLaMA-3.1-70B-Instr (Figure 2a) and LLaMA-3.1-8B-Instr (Figure 2b). The bar chart displays the accuracy of each model within four difficulty ranges (0-25%, 25-50%, 50-75%, 75-100%).  The Pairwise RM demonstrates superior performance across most difficulty levels compared to the Process RM and Outcome RM, exhibiting a particularly significant improvement (40-60% relative increase) on the hardest 50% of problems. Only on the easiest problems (0-25% difficulty) is the Pairwise RM's performance not notably better.", "section": "5.3 Difficulty Analysis"}]
