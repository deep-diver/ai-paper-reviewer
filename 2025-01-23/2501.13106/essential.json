Many existing models focus on directly handling video data, often resulting in lower efficiency and performance.  The high cost and difficulty of creating large, high-quality video datasets also hinder progress. This paper introduces a novel solution by prioritizing high-quality image data during training.  By leveraging the strong foundation of image understanding, VideoLLaMA3 successfully extends its capabilities to video, overcoming many challenges associated with direct video processing. \nThe researchers developed VideoLLaMA3, a novel multimodal foundation model, using a vision-centric training paradigm and framework. This involved four stages: Vision Encoder Adaptation, Vision-Language Pretraining, Multi-task Fine-tuning, and Video-centric Fine-tuning.  Key techniques include Any-resolution Vision Tokenization (AVT) and Differential Frame Pruner (DiffFP) to efficiently handle varied video resolutions and compress redundant frames.  The model achieved state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks, showing strong performance in image, video, and document understanding.", "affiliation": "DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Vision-Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.13106/podcast.wav"}
