{"importance": "This paper pioneers an edge-device healthcare assistant, sidestepping privacy and latency issues of cloud-based systems. It highlights the potential of multi-agent systems in personalized, secure healthcare, opening new avenues for on-device AI research and applications that prioritize user data protection and real-time responsiveness. The **data creation pipeline** can also be useful for other applications as well.", "summary": "On-device multi-agent system overcomes privacy/latency issues in healthcare, enabling personalized, scalable AI assistance.", "takeaways": ["Multi-agent healthcare assistants can operate effectively on edge devices.", "Task-specific agents optimize resource allocation and ensure scalability.", "The Qwen Code Instruct model achieves high performance in planning and calling tasks."], "tldr": "Large Action Models face hurdles in healthcare due to privacy, latency, and internet reliance. This study introduces an **on-device**, **multi-agent** healthcare assistant to overcome these limitations. By using smaller, specialized agents, the system optimizes resource use, scalability, and performance, offering appointment scheduling, health monitoring, medication reminders, and health reporting. This solution addresses sensitive data handling, real-time responsiveness, and offline functionality, all crucial for healthcare applications. \n\nPowered by the **Qwen Code Instruct 2.5 7B** model, the **Planner and Caller Agents** achieve impressive **RougeL scores of 85.5 and 96.5**, respectively, in planning and calling tasks, while remaining lightweight enough for edge deployment. This innovative approach merges the benefits of on-device systems with multi-agent architectures, paving the way for user-centric healthcare solutions with enhanced privacy and efficiency. A synthetic data pipeline is also created to finetune the models for planning and caller tasks.", "affiliation": "Samsung Research", "categories": {"main_category": "AI Applications", "sub_category": "Healthcare"}, "podcast_path": "2503.05397/podcast.wav"}
