Existing benchmarks mostly focus on English, leaving a gap for Arabic, a widely spoken language. CAMEL-Bench includes eight diverse domains (like multimodal understanding, OCR, video analysis, medical imaging) and 38 sub-domains, with over 29,000 questions created and verified by native Arabic speakers to ensure high quality. They tested several models, both open-source and closed-source (like GPT-4), and found that even top models still have significant room for improvement in accurately understanding Arabic in various contexts. This highlights the challenges in developing effective Arabic LMMs and underscores the value of CAMEL-Bench in guiding future research in this area. The benchmark is open-source, promoting further development and advancements in Arabic language processing. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # CAMEL-Bench is a new, comprehensive benchmark for evaluating large multimodal models (LMMs) in Arabic, addressing the scarcity of such resources for this language.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1.

CAMEL-Bench covers 38 sub-domains with over 29K questions carefully curated by native Arabic speakers to rigorously evaluate essential skills desired in Arabic LMMs. Figure 1 is a diagram showing the eight diverse domains and 38 sub-domains of the CAMEL-Bench, a comprehensive Arabic LMM benchmark.\n🔼 Figure 3. The CAMEL-Bench Filtering and Verification Pipeline consists of two paths: Original Arabic and translated Arabic. For original Arabic (top row), a 20% random sample undergoes manual verification; if errors are below 40%, the data passes; otherwise, the entire sub-category is reviewed. For Translated Arabic (bottom row), We employ Qwen7B model [8] to assess semantic similarity between the original and translated question-answer pairs on fuzzy-basis evaluation. Pairs passing the evaluation proceed, while those that fail undergo manual review. Based on this, data may require Manual Handling for manual re-translation, Refine \u0026amp; Verify for refinement through the model, or Non-Translated Review where the data is re-sent for translation due to the absence of an Arabic version. This figure illustrates the two-path pipeline for filtering and verifying data in the CAMEL-Bench, including manual verification for original Arabic data and automated verification with the Qwen7B model for translated Arabic data.\n🔼 Figure 4.

The dataset is a 500GB subset of the Chinese Corpora Internet 3.0 (CCI3.0), carefully refined using a two-stage filtering process. The first stage involves standard data cleaning and quality assessment. The second stage uses a more sophisticated approach involving a 0.5B parameter model trained to identify high-quality samples. This process results in a dataset that is substantially better than existing open-source Chinese datasets. Experiments show that training LLMs on this refined data leads to improved zero-shot performance on a range of benchmarks compared to other similar datasets.

Researchers collected over 40,000 demonstrations across many environments and objects, training policies using imitation learning. Results show that policy generalization performance scales approximately as a power law with the number of training environments and objects; diversity of data is more important than the sheer quantity. A proposed efficient data collection strategy was validated, achieving approximately 90% success in novel environments with unseen objects using data gathered by four collectors in a single afternoon. This work suggests that significant progress in generalizable robotic manipulation is achievable through carefully considered data scaling and efficient collection methods. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper investigates data scaling laws in imitation learning for robotic manipulation, revealing power-law relationships between policy generalization and the number of training environments and objects.

This paper introduces DeCoRe (Decoding by Contrasting Retrieval Heads), a new method to reduce these hallucinations. DeCoRe works by identifying and masking specific \u0026ldquo;retrieval heads\u0026rdquo; within the LLM, which are responsible for retrieving contextual information. By comparing the output of the masked LLM with that of the original LLM and using conditional entropy as a guide, DeCoRe amplifies correct answers and suppresses incorrect ones. Experiments show that DeCoRe substantially improves accuracy on multiple tasks requiring high contextual accuracy, including summarization, instruction following, and question answering. The results demonstrate that DeCoRe is an effective technique for improving the trustworthiness and reliability of LLMs without requiring additional training. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper introduces DeCoRe, a novel decoding strategy for Large Language Models (LLMs) that significantly reduces hallucinations by contrasting the outputs of a base LLM and a masked version of the LLM. The core idea is to leverage the dynamic conditional entropy of the model\u0026rsquo;s next token distribution, enhancing contextual faithfulness and factual accuracy.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Overview of the DeCoRe workflow. Given the same input, the base LLM (LLMbase) and the variant with masked retrieval heads (LLMmasked) predict the next token. An uncertainty estimation is applied to the base model\u0026rsquo;s output using conditional entropy: higher conditional entropy increases the contrastive factor (a), penalising predictions that align with the LLMmasked. The final prediction is selected based on weighted contrastive decoding of the outputs from both models, leading to a more grounded response. The figure illustrates the DeCoRe workflow, showing how contrasting the outputs of a base LLM and a masked LLM, guided by conditional entropy, leads to more accurate predictions by mitigating hallucinations.\n🔼 Figure 3: Correlation between the number of masked retrieval heads and performance of Llama3-8B-Instruct with DeCoReentropy on each task. The correlations are quantified by the Pearson Correlation Coefficient r for each plot. Detailed results are listed in Table 14 and Table 16. The chart displays the correlation between the number of masked retrieval heads and the performance of Llama3-8B-Instruct model using DeCoReentropy across various tasks, showing mostly negative correlation for faithfulness and factuality, but positive correlation for instruction-following.\n🔽 Table 1: Performance of different models and decoding methods on faithfulness evaluation tasks.

Manually creating such datasets is expensive and time-consuming. The researchers introduce \u0026lsquo;Code-as-Intermediary Translation\u0026rsquo; (CIT), a clever technique that uses code as a bridge between the visual chart and textual representation. This allows them to leverage the power of LLMs to generate both the charts and questions efficiently. Using this method, they create REACHQA, a dataset containing 3,000 charts and 20,000 question-answer pairs. Experiments show that models fine-tuned on this dataset perform much better on various chart-related benchmarks, demonstrating improved visual reasoning skills. The improvement generalizes even to non-chart-related mathematical problems, highlighting the method\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness. The researchers also investigate the effect of combining general-purpose multimodal instruction data with their chart-focused data and find that this mixed approach yields even better results. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The research paper introduces Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT), a novel method for efficiently creating training data for multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to improve their visual chart reasoning abilities.

Unlike traditional methods that deterministically generate frames based on input images, Framer lets users influence the transition by manipulating keypoints. This is achieved using a pre-trained video diffusion model which is fine-tuned using both the input images and user defined keypoint trajectories to produce the final interpolation. The system offers both an interactive mode where users directly manipulate keypoints and an \u0026ldquo;autopilot\u0026rdquo; mode where the system automatically estimates keypoints and trajectories. Extensive experiments show Framer surpasses existing techniques across applications like image morphing, time-lapse video generation, and cartoon interpolation, producing smoother and more realistic transitions. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The paper introduces Framer, an interactive frame interpolation framework that allows users to customize video transitions by manipulating keypoints, resulting in more natural and creative interpolations.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Showcases produced by our Framer.

Existing solutions to improve LCMs focus on increasing data size, which is expensive and inefficient. This paper introduces LOGO (Long context aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a new training strategy that uses preference optimization to better align LCM outputs with human preferences. Instead of relying on massive datasets, LOGO uses a clever technique to construct training data that overcomes GPU memory limitations. Experiments show that LOGO significantly improves LCM performance on real-world long-context tasks, bringing open-source models closer to the performance of GPT-4. It\u0026rsquo;s achieved with only 0.3B training data on a single 8xA800 GPU machine in 16 hours, making it a more efficient and accessible method.

Unlike previous models that struggle with fine-grained control and lack explainability, MotionCLR utilizes attention mechanisms (specifically self-attention and cross-attention) to achieve precise control over motion generation and editing. Self-attention focuses on sequential similarity between frames, influencing the order of motion features. Cross-attention establishes word-sequence correspondence, activating relevant timesteps in the motion sequence. This enables various editing methods like motion de-emphasizing, in-place replacement, and example-based generation. Experiments show MotionCLR generates high-quality motions comparable to existing methods and supports the proposed edits with good explainability. Additionally, the model demonstrates the potential for action counting and grounded generation using attention maps, effectively addressing cases of hallucination. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # MotionCLR is a novel attention-based motion diffusion model that enables versatile, training-free motion editing by leveraging attention mechanisms.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: MotionCLR (/\u0026lsquo;moυ∫n klır/) supports versatile motion generation and editing.

The chart illustrates three motion editing methods (motion (de-)emphasizing, in-place motion replacement, motion sequence shifting) by manipulating attention maps.\n🔼 Figure 5: Motion (de-)emphasizing. Different weights of \u0026lsquo;jump\u0026rsquo; (↑ or ↓) in \u0026lsquo;a man jumps.\u0026rsquo; The chart visualizes the impact of modifying the weight of the word \u0026lsquo;jump\u0026rsquo; on the height of jumps in generated motion sequences.\n🔼 Figure 8: t-SNE visualization of different example-based generated results. Different colors imply different driven examples. t-SNE visualization shows that diverse motions generated from the same example motion share similar motion textures, and different examples are well separated.\n🔼 Figure 12: Action counting error rate comparison. Root trajectory (Traj.) vs. attention map (Ours). “σ” is the smoothing parameter. The chart compares the error rates of action counting using root trajectory and attention map, showing that attention map-based counting is less sensitive to noise.\n🔼 Figure 14: Additional visualization results for different (de-)emphasizing weights. The self-attention maps show how varying the different weights (e.g., ↓ 0.05, ↓ 0.10, ↑ 0.33, and ↑ 1.00) affect the emphasis on motion. The self-attention maps for different (de-)emphasizing weights show how varying weights affect motion emphasis.\n🔼 Figure 15: The effect of varying w in classifier-free guidance on generated motions. While changing w influences the general alignment between the text \u0026lsquo;a man jumps.\u0026rsquo; and the generated motion, it does not provide precise control over finer details like jump height and frequency. The chart displays the effect of varying classifier-free guidance weights (w) on the height of generated jumps, showing that while it affects overall alignment, it lacks fine-grained control over jump height and frequency.\n🔼 Figure 20: Comparison between w/ vs. w/o grounded motion generation settings. The root height and motion visualization of the textual prompt “a person jumps four times”. The chart compares the root height trajectory of a generated motion with and without temporal grounding, showing the improvement in aligning the generated motion with the textual prompt when temporal grounding is used.\n🔼 Figure 26: Empirical study of attention patterns. We use the example “a person walks stop and then jumps.” (a) Horizontal distance traveled by the person over time, highlighting distinct walking and jumping phases. (b) The vertical height changes of the person, indicating variations during walking and jumping actions. (c) The cross-attention map between timesteps and the described actions. Notice that “walk” and “jump” receive a stronger attention signal corresponding to the walk and jump segments. (d) The self-attention map, which clearly identifies repeated walking and jumping cycles, shows similar patterns in the sub-actions. (e) Visualization of the motion sequences, demonstrating the walking and jumping actions. Figure 26 shows an empirical study of attention mechanisms by visualizing horizontal distance, vertical height, cross-attention, self-attention maps, and motion visualization of a \u0026lsquo;person walks, stops, and then jumps\u0026rsquo; example, highlighting distinct phases and patterns.\nMore on tables 🔽 Table 1: Comparison with different methods on the HumanML3D dataset.

The authors introduce W-Bench, a new benchmark to test these methods\u0026rsquo; resilience against various editing techniques (like regeneration, global and local changes, and even conversion to video). Testing eleven existing methods, most failed to preserve the watermark under these advanced edits. To address this, the authors developed a new method called VINE. VINE cleverly incorporates blurring distortions (which mimic the effects of some AI editing processes) into its training. This helps the watermarking process become more resistant to such edits. Additionally, VINE uses a powerful AI model (SDXL-Turbo) to more effectively and imperceptibly embed the watermark, enhancing image quality. Experiments showed that VINE significantly outperformed existing methods in terms of both the watermarks\u0026rsquo; survival rate after edits and the quality of the watermarked images. This is a valuable contribution because it tackles a critical challenge in copyright protection in the face of powerful image manipulation tools. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise and informative summary of the research paper on robust watermarking against image editing, highlighting its key contributions and impact on the field.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: (a) Flowchart of the W-Bench evaluation process.

In this example, the editing model Instruct-Pix2Pix, denoted as ∈(·), is employed. The function F(·) represents the Fourier transform, and we visualize its magnitude on a logarithmic scale. The figure illustrates how image editing affects the frequency spectrum of an image, showing that Instruct-Pix2Pix primarily removes high-frequency components while preserving low-frequency content.\n🔼 Figure 4: The overall framework of our method, VINE. We utilize the pretrained one-step text-to-image model SDXL-Turbo as the watermark encoder. A condition adaptor is incorporated to fuse the watermark with the image before passing the information to the VAE encoder. Zero-convolution layers (Zhang et al., 2023) and skip connections are added for better perceptual similarity. For decoding the watermark, we employ ConvNeXt-B (Liu et al., 2022b) as the decoder, with an additional fully connected layer to output a 100-bit watermark. Throughout the entire training process, the SDXL-Turbo text prompt is set to null prompt. Figure 9 shows the condition adaptor architecture. The figure illustrates the architecture of the proposed VINE watermarking method, highlighting the use of SDXL-Turbo, a condition adaptor, zero-convolution layers, skip connections, and ConvNeXt-B.\n🔼 Figure 1: (a) Flowchart of the W-Bench evaluation process.

Results are averaged over 1,000 images. Image editing methods tend to remove frequency patterns in the mid- and high-frequency bands, while low-frequency patterns remain largely unaffected. This trend is also observed with blurring distortions such as pixelation and defocus blur. In contrast, commonly used distortions like JPEG compression and saturation do not exhibit similar behavior in the frequency domain. The analysis of SVD is not included, as it removes all patterns, rendering them invisible to the human eye.

Researchers used various editing methods on different LLMs, assessing their performance across multiple benchmarks. They found that while model editing is useful for small updates, it causes performance deterioration and safety issues as the number of edits increases. Instruction-tuned models proved more robust, while larger models showed better resistance. The study highlights that existing methods are unsuitable for large-scale knowledge updates and stresses the need for improved, safer editing techniques. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper investigates the impact of model editing techniques on the general capabilities and safety of Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors perform a comprehensive evaluation of various editing methods and find that current methods, while effective for small-scale knowledge updates, significantly impair LLM performance and safety when applied at larger scales. This challenges the prevailing assumption that model editing is a safe and efficient method for updating LLMs.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Illustration about the model editing and its pitfalls in retaining edited knowledge.

The authors developed data selection and filtering techniques, creating the \u0026lsquo;Skywork-Reward\u0026rsquo; dataset (only 80,000 preference pairs, much smaller than existing datasets). This curated dataset was used to train a series of reward models that achieved top rankings on the RewardBench leaderboard. The study also explored different loss functions, finding that the Bradley-Terry loss consistently yielded the best results. The researchers publicly released both their dataset and models to facilitate further research.

Unlike traditional methods that require extensive manual annotation of each video frame, SMITE leverages a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model and a small set of reference images (one or a few) to segment unseen videos. This significantly reduces the need for manual labeling. The method incorporates a tracking mechanism and low-frequency regularization to ensure that the segmentations are temporally consistent and don\u0026rsquo;t flicker. Experiments on a new dataset, SMITE-50, and existing benchmarks demonstrate that SMITE outperforms state-of-the-art alternatives in terms of both accuracy and temporal consistency, handling pose changes, occlusions, and variations in color. User studies confirmed its effectiveness. SMITE offers a flexible solution for videos needing consistent segmentation across frames (e.g., VFX) without requiring extensive frame-by-frame labeling for every video. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on SMITE: SEGMENT ME IN TIME.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: SMITE. Using only one or few segmentation references with fine granularity (left), our method learns to segment different unseen videos respecting the segmentation references. The figure illustrates the SMITE method, showing how a few annotated images are used to train a model that can then segment different unseen videos while maintaining consistency with the original annotations.\n🔽 Table 1: Quantitative evaluation on SMITE-50 dataset.

During inference (a), we invert a given video into a noisy latent by iteratively adding noise. We then use an inflated U-Net denoiser (b) along with the trained text embedding as input to denoise the segments. A tracking module ensures that the generated segments are spatially and temporally consistent via spatio-temporal guidance. The video latent zt is updated by a tracking energy Etrack (c) that makes the segments temporally consistent and also a low-frequency regularizer (d) Ereg which guides the model towards better spatial consistency. The figure illustrates the SMITE pipeline, detailing the process of video segmentation using an inflated U-Net, tracking modules, and a low-frequency regularizer to ensure temporal and spatial consistency.\n🔼 Figure 4: Segment tracking module ensures that segments are consistent across time. It uses co-tracker to track each point of the object\u0026rsquo;s segment (here it is nose) and then finds point correspondence of this segment (denoted by blue dots) across timesteps. When the tracked point is of a different class (e.g,. face) then it is recovered by using temporal voting. The misclassified pixel is then replaced by the average of the neighbouring pixels of adjacent frames. This results are temporally consistent segments without visible flickers. The figure illustrates how the segment tracking module maintains temporal consistency by tracking segments across frames and using temporal voting to correct misclassified pixels.\n🔼 Figure 3: Best viewed in Adobe Acrobat. The figure compares the video segmentation results using frame-by-frame processing, without tracking and low-pass regularization, and with SMITE\u0026rsquo;s proposed approach.\n🔼 Figure 5: SMITE-50 Dataset sample. The figure shows sample images from the SMITE-50 dataset, showcasing different object categories (horses, faces, cars, and non-text) with varying levels of segmentation granularity.\n🔼 Figure 6: Visual comparisons with other methods demonstrate that SMITE maintains better motion consistency of segments and delivers cleaner, more accurate segmentations. Both GSAM2 and Baseline-I struggle to accurately capture the horse’s mane, and GSAM2 misses one leg (Left), whereas our method yields more precise results. Additionally, both alternative techniques create artifacts around the chin (Right), while SMITE produces a cleaner segmentation. Figure 6 presents a visual comparison of video segmentation results between SMITE and other methods, highlighting SMITE’s superior performance in maintaining motion consistency and producing cleaner segmentations.\n🔼 Figure 7: Additional results. We visualize the generalization capability of SMITE model (trained on the reference images) in various challenging poses, shape, and even in cut-shapes. Figure 7 shows additional results demonstrating SMITE’s ability to generalize segmentation to unseen videos with objects in various poses and shapes, even when cut.\n🔼 Figure 8: Segmentation results in challenging scenarios . SMITE accurately segments out the objects under occlusion (\u0026lsquo;ice-cream\u0026rsquo;) or camouflage (\u0026rsquo;turtle\u0026rsquo;) highlighting the robustness of our segmentation technique. Figure 8 shows examples of SMITE\u0026rsquo;s accurate segmentation results in challenging scenarios with object occlusion and camouflage.\nMore on tables 🔽 Table 1: Quantitative evaluation on SMITE-50 dataset.

Unlike previous approaches that rely on expensive, closed-source models or complex augmentation techniques, ScaleQuest leverages readily available, smaller open-source models to generate a million problem-solution pairs from scratch. The efficiency and low cost of this approach are key advantages. The generated dataset significantly outperforms existing open-source datasets in improving the performance of various LLMs on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. The researchers demonstrate that simply fine-tuning a base model with their dataset can surpass even strong, closed-source models like GPT-4-Turbo and Claude-3.5 Sonnet.

This paper identifies the cause: a left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions used during training. To address this, the researchers propose STRING, a training-free method that shifts well-trained position embeddings to overwrite less effective ones. STRING significantly improves performance across several LLMs on long-context benchmarks, establishing new state-of-the-art results for open-source models. Even without additional training, STRING enhances the ability of LLMs to effectively use longer contexts, bringing them closer to their theoretical potential. This is achieved through a clever manipulation of the position embedding matrix to leverage frequently-used positions for representing longer distances, thus compensating for the under-training of less frequent, long-distance positions. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Shifted Rotray position embeddING (STRING) significantly improves the effective context length of large language models by addressing the left-skewed frequency distribution of relative positions, achieving state-of-the-art results for open-source LLMs.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Position frequency distribution exhibits a pronounced left-skewed pattern across training data of varying lengths.

VQuestionHow do the authors verify the long context code reasoning of Llama-3 (The answer is in Section 4.3.4 of Llama Team (2024))Llama 3 RoPEThey select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files, and remove one of these key files from a repository.X(not addressing the question)Llama 3 STRINGThe authors verify the long context code reasoning of Llama-3 by parsing Python files to identify import statements and determine their dependencies. From here, they select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files. They remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code. VQuestionHow does the llama3 team solve the Hallucinations issues (The answer is in Section 4.3.6 of Llama Team (2024))Llama 3 RoPEThey follow the principle that post-training should align the model to \"know what it knows\" rather than add knowledge, and generate data that aligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data.X(in complete)Llama 3 STRINGThe authors use a knowledge probing technique to align the model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. This data generation process involves extracting a data snippet from the pre-training data, generating a factual question about these snippets, sampling responses from the model, scoring the correctness of the generations, scoring the informativeness of the generations, and generating a refusal for responses that are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations.

It uses a technique called parameter-free cross-attention to reduce the number of parameters in the model and speed up both training and inference, which is important because training large vision-language models usually requires a lot of computing power and memory. The approach also incorporates multiscale visual features to better represent images. Additionally, they have an adaptive fusion approach that dynamically prioritizes the most important visual details for processing. Experiments on various vision-language tasks such as question answering and captioning show that ADEM-VL performs better than existing methods while being more efficient. The researchers suggest that their approach makes it more feasible to use larger language models in vision-language applications, which opens up new possibilities for building more powerful multimodal systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on ADEM-VL, a novel vision-language tuning method.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Fig. 1.

Current RLHF methods are online and on-policy, meaning the model generates text, receives feedback, and updates simultaneously. This is slow. The authors propose asynchronous off-policy RLHF, where sample generation and model training happen concurrently but separately. This allows for using highly optimized libraries for each stage, leading to speed increases. The research explores the impact of off-policy learning on RLHF performance and finds that Online Direct Preference Optimization (Online DPO) is the most robust algorithm in this setting. They demonstrate significant speed improvements (up to 40% faster) on various sized LLMs while matching or exceeding the performance of synchronous methods. The study also examines compute optimization strategies and identifies trade-offs between efficiency and performance. Overall, the paper introduces a promising alternative to conventional RLHF, offering faster and more efficient training of LLMs. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper introduces asynchronous RLHF, a novel approach to training large language models (LLMs) that significantly speeds up the process while maintaining performance.

In practice, generation and training speeds differ so a challenge of asynchronous learning is how best to balance usage and leverage idle compute time to further improve training. The figure illustrates training-bound versus generation-bound asynchronous RLHF, highlighting the challenge of balancing generation and training speeds to optimize compute usage.\n🔼 Figure 1: Asynchronous off-policy RLHF is more computationally efficient, and matches the win-rate of synchronous on-policy RLHF on TLDR across model scales. On 4×A100 GPUs, it results in training a 2.8B Pythia model 25% faster and improvements in speed increase with scale.

On 4×A100 GPUs, it results in training a 2.8B Pythia model 25% faster and improvements in speed increase with scale. The chart shows that asynchronous off-policy RLHF is more computationally efficient than synchronous on-policy RLHF across different model scales, achieving similar performance with faster training times.\n🔼 Figure 3: Trade-off between Win-Rate and KL in Off-Policy PPO. PPO performance decreases as learning becomes more off-policy. Win-rate is highest when learning is fully on-policy (generate then train on N = 1 mini-batches). As we increase N, our model must take more steps on data generated by the same old policy. This increases off-policyness and reduces win-rate. Left: Gold win-rate over training Middle: KL (perplexity) over training, higher is further from initial model Right: Gold win-rate vs KL The chart illustrates the trade-off between win-rate and KL divergence (a measure of how much the model has drifted from its initial state) in off-policy PPO, showing how performance decreases as the learning becomes more off-policy.\n🔼 Figure 4: Robustness of RLHF Losses to Off-Policyness. Online DPO is more robust to off-policyness than PPO, RLOO (Left) or Best-of-2 SFT (Right). Performance is shown across levels of off-policyness as mediated by number of mini-batches N∈ {1,2,4,8,16}. With higher N increasing off-policyness, Online DPO retains much more performance than other methods, as evidenced by off-policy points still being clustered close to optimal performance. The chart displays the robustness of different RLHF loss functions (Online DPO, PPO, RLOO, Best-of-2) to varying degrees of off-policyness, showing Online DPO\u0026rsquo;s superior performance.\n🔼 Figure 5: Scaling Model Size with Off-Policy RLHF. Plotting the final win-rate vs KL for N = 1 → 64 mini-batches, covering a spectrum of on-policy to off-policy RL. Scaling policy size (left) improves off-policy robustness as seen by tighter clustering of points. But scaling reward model size (right) does not, even though it reduces overoptimization, achieving reward with smaller KL. The chart displays the relationship between final win-rate, KL divergence, and model size (both policy and reward models) across various levels of off-policy learning.\n🔼 Figure 7: Optimizing Generation-Bound RLHF. We can leverage extra training GPU cycles to do multiple updates on the same generated mini-batch (\u0026lsquo;ppo epochs\u0026rsquo;). Left: At 410m and 1B scales, more updates per batch increases the win-rate achieved at any given episode, making training more data efficient. Right: Across scales, more updates change the pareto frontier and cause models to achieve the same win-rate at a higher KL. The chart shows the effect of multiple training updates per mini-batch on the win-rate and KL divergence in generation-bound asynchronous RLHF across different model scales.\n🔼 Figure 8: Optimizing Training-Bound RLHF. We can leverage extra generation GPU cycles to sample K completions per prompt instead of 2. Left: Sampling K = 4 improves the gradient such that we can train for half the number of steps and, across scales, achieve the same final win-rate at a fraction of the compute time. Right: The trade-off is that increasing K causes models to drift more in terms of KL in order to achieve the same win-rate. The chart displays the trade-off between compute efficiency and model performance (measured by KL divergence) when optimizing training-bound RLHF by varying the number of samples generated per prompt.\n🔼 Figure 9: Large-Scale Asynchronous RLHF.

Existing methods struggle to produce large-scale, dynamic scenes. DynamicCity overcomes this by using a two-stage process. First, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) learns a compact 4D representation called HexPlane. This representation is then used by a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to generate the actual LiDAR data. The VAE employs a novel projection module to effectively compress the data into six 2D feature maps, making it efficient for DiT processing. The DiT is further enhanced by a Padded Rollout Operation that arranges the HexPlane feature maps into a squared format. This improves the model\u0026rsquo;s efficiency and accuracy. DynamicCity is evaluated on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming existing methods across several metrics, and demonstrating its versatility through various application scenarios. The research is significant because it offers a step change in generating more detailed and comprehensive 4D LiDAR data that is much closer to real-world situations. This capability could substantially improve the development and training of autonomous systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on DynamicCity: Large-Scale LiDAR Generation from Dynamic Scenes.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Dynamic LiDAR scene generation from DynamicCity.

Instead of relying on large, slow language models, LiMAC uses a smaller, faster Action Transformer (AcT) combined with a vision-language model (VLM). The AcT handles simple actions like clicking and scrolling, while the VLM is used for more complex tasks requiring language understanding (like writing a text message). Testing showed LiMAC is much faster (up to 30 times) and more accurate (up to 42% improvement) than using larger language models alone. This is important because smartphones have limited computing power, making large models impractical for many tasks.

The history of observations-actions {ot, at-1, Ot-1..} and goal g are processed to vector x and passed to AcT. The image observation omg with the bounding boxes and the goal g are passed as inputs to the VLM. The VLM is only called if an action that requires text completion is selected, based on the action type output of AcT. The action is finally selected based on the protocol described in Section 3. The figure illustrates the LiMAC architecture, showing the interaction between the Action Transformer (AcT), the Vision-Language Model (VLM), and the input data (goal and observations).\n🔼 Figure 4: Relaxed target element in yellow (timestep 3) and failed action in red (final timestep). The target element of the click in timestep 3 is considered correct under our relaxed accuracy because its bounding box is almost identical to the correct element, and clicking either would have the same effect (opening the text bar). In the final timestep, the agent inputs text \u0026lsquo;Detroit\u0026rsquo; rather than \u0026lsquo;Las Vegas\u0026rsquo;, a clear confusion between the origin and destination of the trip stated in the goal, leading to an incorrect prediction.

Timestep 4 is considered correct under our relaxed input-text textual component because it is simply the singular form of the correct text, leading to a Jaccard index greater than 0.5 and presumably the same search results.

Current LLMs generate text one word at a time, which is inefficient. The authors propose \u0026lsquo;multi-draft speculative sampling\u0026rsquo; as a solution. This involves using several smaller models (drafts) to generate multiple word options simultaneously. A larger, more accurate model then selects the best option from these drafts. The paper shows that the best word selection method can be broken down into two simpler steps. First, use a technique similar to \u0026lsquo;importance sampling\u0026rsquo; to choose a word from the drafts. Then, use existing \u0026lsquo;speculative sampling\u0026rsquo; to refine the choice and ensure it aligns with the larger model\u0026rsquo;s distribution. Through theoretical analysis and experiments using the OPT model, they demonstrate consistent improvements in speed and efficiency compared to existing approaches. They also provide new insights into the theoretical limits of this technique. The improvements are shown across various tasks with a consistent improvement across three tasks, XSum, Dolly, and WMT.

Current methods rely heavily on expensive, human-labeled datasets which quickly become outdated. This research proposes a novel scalable solution. Instead of relying on human annotations, they create a synthetic preference dataset (\u0026lsquo;Syn-Pic\u0026rsquo;) by generating images from multiple T2I models and ranking them using pre-trained reward functions. This significantly reduces costs and time. Furthermore, they introduce \u0026lsquo;RankDPO\u0026rsquo;, a new optimization technique that leverages this ranked data, enhancing the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to follow prompts accurately and generate higher quality images. Experiments on various benchmark datasets show that this approach outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results while using far fewer resources. The synthetic data collection method is highly scalable, allowing for continuous improvements as new T2I models emerge. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper introduces a novel approach to improve text-to-image generation models by leveraging a scalable, synthetically generated preference dataset and a ranking-based optimization technique. This avoids the expensive and time-consuming process of collecting and labeling large real-world datasets.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 2: Overview of our two novel components: (A) Syn-Pic and (B) RankDPO. Left illustrates the pipeline to generate a synthetically ranked preference dataset. It starts by collecting prompts and generating images using the same prompt for different T2I models. Next, we calculate the overall preference score using Reward models (e.g., PickScore, ImageReward). Finally, we rank these images in the decreasing order of preference scores. Right: Given true preference rankings for generated images per prompt, we first obtain predicted ranking by current model checkpoint using scores si (see Eq. 5). In this instance, although the predicted ranking is inverse of the true rankings, the ranks (1, 4) obtains a larger penalty than the ranks (2, 3). This penalty is added to our ranking loss through DCG weights (see Eq. 6). Thus, by optimizing 0 with Ranking Loss (see Eq. 7), the updated model addresses the incorrect rankings (1,4). This procedure is repeated over the training process, where the rankings induced by the model aligns with the labelled preferences. This figure illustrates the pipeline of generating a synthetically ranked preference dataset (Syn-Pic) and the ranking-based preference optimization (RankDPO) method.\n🔼 Figure 3: Win rates of our approach compared to DPO-SDXL and SDXL on human evaluation.

Instead of training large DLMs from scratch, a resource-intensive process, the researchers propose a method to adapt readily available, large open-source AR models into DLMs. This is achieved by strategically bridging the differences between AR and DLM training objectives and architectures, specifically addressing issues with causal masking and attention mechanisms. Experiments demonstrate that this approach allows the creation of competitive DLMs (DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA) across a range of sizes (127M to 7B parameters), using significantly less training data than conventional methods. The adapted DLMs exhibit strong performance on various benchmarks, including language modeling, reasoning, and common-sense tasks, showing they are comparable to AR models. The study\u0026rsquo;s key contribution is the demonstration of an efficient and effective way to scale DLMs without needing to train massive models from scratch, offering an important step forward in DLM development. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper introduces a novel approach to scaling diffusion language models by adapting pre-trained autoregressive models.

Left: The shift operation in AR models enables the output layer hi to approximate the distribution of next tokens Xi+1 in hidden representations through the cross entropy (CE) loss. Middle: We remove the causal mask gradually during training eventually making our model bi-directional. Right: inside the diffusion models we shift the logits to compute the loss with the next token (i.e., the loss on hi would be with respect to xi+1), while perceptually, the diffusion models are still functioning as recovering the original signals (since hi corresponds to xi+1 in AR loss). The figure illustrates the adaptation process of converting autoregressive language models into diffusion language models by gradually removing causal masking, employing a shift operation, and using a time-embedding-free architecture.\n🔼 Figure 2: Training loss over tokens for different scales of our adapted diffusion models.

It addresses the limitations of existing benchmarks by proposing a dual evaluation approach. First, explicit perceptual evaluation uses human feedback on visual quality to assess the realism and fidelity of generated videos. Second, implicit manipulative evaluation assesses how well the generated videos translate into correct control signals in embodied tasks. The research categorizes predictive models based on their level of embodiment, highlighting the progression from text-only to actionable video generation. Three representative embodied scenarios—open-ended environment, autonomous driving, and robot manipulation—are used for evaluation. The authors create a new dataset, HF-Embodied, with fine-grained human feedback to support the perceptual evaluation.

(Top) Instruction Prompt Generation. We use a large collection of video captions from the internet and our predefined embodied evaluation dimensions. These are expanded using GPT and manually verified to create a corresponding Task Instruction Prompt List for data generation and evaluation. (Bottom) HF-Embodied Dataset Generation. Massive internet-sourced embodied videos with captions are used to train data generation models. Fine-grained Human Feedback Annotation is then applied to the embodied videos according to the corresponding Task Instruction Prompt List, covering multiple embodied dimensions. This figure illustrates the process of generating the HF-Embodied dataset for explicit perceptual evaluation, which involves instruction prompt generation, data generation model training, and fine-grained human feedback annotation.\n🔼 Figure 3: Overview of Implicit Manipulative Evaluation. Embodied tasks in different scenarios are decomposed into executable sub-tasks. The video generation model generates corresponding predicted videos based on the current instructions and real-time observations. Using a pre-trained IDM or a goal-based policy, the agent executes the generated sequence of actions. After a fixed timestep, the predicted video is refreshed by sampling again from the video generation model, and this process repeats. Finally, the success rates of various embodied tasks are obtained through monitors in the simulation environment. The figure illustrates the process of Implicit Manipulative Evaluation, decomposing embodied tasks into sub-tasks, using video generation models and video-to-action mapping to evaluate task performance.\n🔼 Figure 7: Rollout of Open-Ended Embodied Environment in Implicit Manipulative Evaluation.

Instead of using complex methods, ZIP-FIT uses a simple compression algorithm (gzip) to measure how well potential training data matches the specific task. The results show that using data selected by ZIP-FIT leads to faster training and better performance on two tasks: turning natural language mathematical statements into formal code (Autoformalization) and generating computer code from natural language descriptions. ZIP-FIT is also faster than other existing data selection techniques. The study demonstrates that focusing on a smaller, well-aligned dataset is much more effective than using a larger, less relevant one.

Unlike previous methods that rely on human-annotated data or complex reward models, SSO automatically generates preference signals during the training process. It does this by using predefined principles to create pairs of responses, one considered \u0026ldquo;good\u0026rdquo; and one \u0026ldquo;bad.\u0026rdquo; SSO focuses on making sure these responses are relevant to the current model and maintaining a consistent difference in quality between them throughout the training. Experiments using Qwen2 and Llama3.1 showed that SSO leads to significant performance gains across multiple benchmarks, including both subjective and objective evaluations. The generated data also improved reward model training. This method represents a substantial advance in automated alignment, offering a more efficient and scalable approach to the challenging problem of aligning LLMs with human preferences. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Self-Steering Optimization (SSO) is a novel algorithm for aligning large language models (LLMs) by autonomously generating high-quality preference signals during training, eliminating the need for manual annotation and improving efficiency and effectiveness.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 2: The philosophical motivation of our methods. Greater overlap on the x-axis (performance) between the generated distributions (red and blue) and the original distribution (orange) indicates stronger on-policy behavior. Previous automated methods extract chosen and rejected distributions through different methods, which may be less learnable for the policy model and hard to distinguish after iterative training. Our approach (SSO) optimizes models to generate near-on-policy signals where there remains a gap between chosen and rejected distributions, which benefits the automated alignment process. The figure illustrates how the proposed Self-Steering Optimization (SSO) method generates near-on-policy preference signals, contrasting it with previous off-policy methods.\n🔼 Figure 1: Results of SSO in Online, Offline, and RM Training.

Greater overlap on the x-axis (performance) between the generated distributions (red and blue) and the original distribution (orange) indicates stronger on-policy behavior. Previous automated methods extract chosen and rejected distributions through different methods, which may be less learnable for the policy model and hard to distinguish after iterative training.

The figure illustrates how the proposed Self-Steering Optimization (SSO) method generates near on-policy preference signals, unlike previous off-policy methods, by progressively optimizing the model to maintain a gap between chosen and rejected responses throughout iterative training.\n🔼 Figure 3: Our approach consists of two iterative steps: 1) Constructing contrastive prompts and sampling responses. Given a query, the policy model first identifies the most relevant features and principles to the query. We then construct a pair of contrastive prompts based on these principles and sample corresponding responses. These responses are then used to form three preference pairs for alignment. 2) Training the model with a weighted objective incorporating three distinct losses. The figure illustrates the two-step process of Self-Steering Optimization (SSO), showing how contrastive prompts are constructed and used to train a model with three preference pairs.\n🔼 Figure 1: Results of SSO in Online, Offline, and RM Training.

This paper presents Inf-CL, a novel method tackling this limitation. Inf-CL cleverly partitions the similarity matrix into smaller, manageable tiles, preventing its full instantiation. This tile-based strategy is further enhanced with a multi-level approach, leveraging both cross-GPU and in-GPU parallelization to optimize communication and computation. This results in a memory footprint that scales linearly instead of quadratically with batch size. The results show Inf-CL can handle vastly larger batch sizes (up to 12M) than previous methods, training a CLIP-ViT-L/14 model without sacrificing accuracy. The achieved memory reduction is substantial – two orders of magnitude better than the state-of-the-art.

Multi-stream frameworks predict a single output but involve parallel processing streams, either at the decoding stage (MF#1) or the encoding stage (MF#2). Branched frameworks extend multi-stream framework to produce multiple outputs from either a single input (BF#1) or multiple inputs (BF#2). These side outputs typically receive supervision from additional supervisory signals, such as boundary cues.

It comprises a culture-agnostic subset (translated from English MMMU) and a culture-specific subset (uniquely Japanese). Evaluating 18 LMMs, the study reveals substantial performance drops when evaluating in Japanese, even on translated content, showing limitations in pure language capabilities. The culture-specific subset further uncovers inadequate cultural understanding.

Current LLMs have limited context windows, making long videos problematic. LongVU cleverly reduces the number of video tokens (data pieces representing video frames) while keeping important visual information. It does this by identifying similar and redundant frames, strategically reducing the number of tokens needed to describe them. The result is that LongVU can efficiently handle much longer videos than before while maintaining accuracy on video understanding tasks, such as answering questions about a video. Experiments show significant improvements over existing approaches, particularly with very long videos (an hour or more). Importantly, LongVU even works well with smaller LLMs, making it more practical to deploy. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To summarize the academic research paper on LongVU, a spatiotemporal adaptive compression mechanism for long video language understanding.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 2. Architecture of LongVU. Given a densely sampled video frames, we first utilize DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) prior to remove redundant frames, and fuse the remaining frame features from both SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) and DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023), described in Section 3.1. Then we selectively reduce visual tokens via cross-modal query, detailed in Section 3.2. Finally, as demonstrated in Section 3.3, we conduct spatial token compression based on temporal dependencies to further meet the context length of LLMs. The figure illustrates the architecture of LongVU, detailing its spatiotemporal adaptive token compression mechanism which involves temporal reduction using DINOv2, selective feature reduction via cross-modal query, and spatial token compression based on temporal dependencies.\n🔼 Figure 1 Effectiveness of our LongVU over commonly-used uniform sampling and dense sampling. Uniform sampling overlooks critical frames due to its sparse nature. Dense sampling may surpass the maximum context length, leading to truncation of tokens from targeted frames. In contrast, our method can adaptively conduct spatiotemporal compression, accommodating long video sequences while preserving more visual details. The chart compares the effectiveness of LongVU against uniform and dense sampling methods for processing long videos, highlighting LongVU\u0026rsquo;s adaptive spatiotemporal compression for better visual detail preservation.\n🔽 Table 1 Results on comprehensive video understanding benchmarks ModelsSizeContext Length#FramesEgoSchemaMVBenchMLVUVideoMMEOverallLongDuration179.8 sec16 sec3~120 min1〜60 min30〜60 minProprietary ModelsGPT4-V (OpenAI, 2023)--1fps55.643.7-60.756.9GPT4-o (OpenAI, 2024)--1fps72.264.666.277.272.1Open-Source Video MLLMsVideo-LLaVA (Lin et al., 2023)7B4k838.441.047.340.438.1LLaMA-VID (Li et al., 2023d)7B4k1fps38.541.933.2--Chat-UniVi (Jin et al., 2023)7B4k64---45.941.8ShareGPT4Video (Chen et al., 2024)8B8k16-51.246.443.637.9LLaVA-NeXT-Video (Zhang et al., 2024b)7B8k3243.933.7-46.5-VideoLLaMA2 (Cheng et al., 2024)7B8k3251.754.648.546.643.8LongVA (Zhang et al., 2024a)7B224k128--56.354.347.6VideoChat2 (Li et al., 2024b)7B8k1654.460.447.954.639.2LLaVA-OneVision (Li et al., 2024a)7B8k3260.156.764.758.246.7LongVU (Ours)7B8k1fps67.666.965.460.659.5 Table 1 presents a quantitative comparison of LongVU against various state-of-the-art video understanding models across four benchmarks, showcasing LongVU\u0026rsquo;s superior performance.\nMore visual insights # More on figures 🔼 Figure 3 Examples for various video understanding capabilities of LongVU model.

Unlike previous methods that relied on 3D information, LVSM uses a data-driven approach. This means it learns directly from images without pre-built 3D models, making it more flexible and adaptable. They propose two versions: an encoder-decoder model and a decoder-only model. The encoder-decoder model processes images into a compact representation before creating the new views. The decoder-only model creates the new views directly from the input images. The decoder-only model performed better in terms of image quality and the ability to handle various input image numbers. Experiments across multiple datasets showed that both versions of LVSM outperformed existing methods. This is significant because it shows that high-quality images can be created from different viewpoints without needing complex 3D models, opening up opportunities for various applications. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The paper introduces LVSM, a novel transformer-based model for novel view synthesis that minimizes 3D inductive bias, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: LVSM supports feed-forward novel view synthesis from sparse posed image inputs (even from a single view) on both objects and scenes.

LVSM first patchifies the posed input images into tokens. The target view to be synthesized is represented by its Plücker ray embeddings and is also tokenized. The input view and target tokens are sent to a full transformer-based model to predict the tokens that are used to regress the target view pixels. We study two LVSM transformer architectures, as a Decoder-only architecture (left) and a Encoder-Decoder architecture (right). The figure illustrates the two transformer-based architectures of the Large View Synthesis Model (LVSM): a decoder-only architecture and an encoder-decoder architecture, both designed for novel view synthesis from sparse image inputs.\n🔼 Figure 3: Object-level visual comparison at 512 resolution. Given 4 sparse input posed images (leftmost column), we compare our high-res object-level novel-view rendering results with two baselines: Instant3D’s Triplane-LRM (Li et al., 2023) and GS-LRM (Res-512) (Zhang et al., 2024) . Both our Encoder-Decoder and Decoder-Only models exhibit fewer floaters (first example) and fewer blurry artifacts (second example), compared to the baselines. Our Decoder-Only model effectively handles complex geometry, including small holes (third example) and thin structures (fourth example). Additionally, it preserves the details of high-frequency texture (last example).

Unlike previous methods, MathNeuro uses only the model\u0026rsquo;s forward pass (how the model processes information), making it computationally efficient and applicable to massive models. The method identifies parameters vital for math by comparing their importance for math problems versus other tasks. Experiments showed that removing these math-specific parameters eliminates the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to solve math problems, while scaling up these parameters surprisingly improves its math performance by 4-17% on a standard math benchmark (GSM8K). Importantly, these manipulations don\u0026rsquo;t negatively impact the model\u0026rsquo;s performance on non-math tasks.

This paper introduces PyramidDrop, a method that speeds up both training and inference. PyramidDrop analyzes the importance of image tokens at different layers of the model, finding that shallower layers heavily utilize all tokens while deeper layers have increased redundancy. Leveraging this, PyramidDrop strategically drops a portion of image tokens in deeper layers. Experimental results using LLaVA-NeXT show a 40% reduction in training time and a 55% reduction in inference FLOPs without significant performance decline. It also works as a plug-and-play method for faster inference, outperforming comparable methods. This research highlights the importance of analyzing token redundancy within models for efficiency improvements. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper introduces PyramidDrop, a novel visual redundancy reduction strategy for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It significantly accelerates both training and inference times by selectively dropping visual tokens in deeper layers, with minimal performance loss. The study reveals that visual tokens are increasingly redundant as models progress through deeper layers, which is a crucial insight for optimizing LVLM efficiency.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 2: Overview of PyramidDrop. We divide the forward pass of the LLM into multiple stages, and drop part of the image tokens at the end of each stage with a pre-defined ratio. The dropping is based on a lightweight attention calculation with a negligible time overhead, and according to this criterion, the LLM accurately selects important image tokens related to instruction. Due to the efficient redundancy reduction strategy, the average sequence length decreases rapidly. The figure illustrates the PyramidDrop method, showing how the model divides the forward pass into stages and drops image tokens at the end of each stage based on attention weights, reducing the sequence length.\n🔼 Figure 1: Observatioins about visual redundancy acoross layers.

The chart displays the TextVQA performance of LLaVA-1.5 with varying ratios of retained image tokens at different layers, and visualizes the attention map in shallow and deep layers to show that visual redundancy progressively increases in deeper layers of the model.\n🔽 Table 1: LVLM w and w/o our method on 6 benchmarks.

Existing methods struggled to handle both the dynamic movement and realistic reflections. SpectroMotion overcomes this by using three main techniques: It improves how it estimates the direction of surface normals (which are important for calculating reflections), uses a flexible environment map that adjusts to changing light conditions, and trains the model in multiple stages to get better results. Testing showed SpectroMotion produces higher quality results compared to other approaches, especially for complex scenes. It\u0026rsquo;s the first 3D Gaussian Splatting method that can render realistic dynamic specular scenes. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the academic paper on SpectroMotion: Dynamic 3D Reconstruction of Specular Scenes.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Our method, SpectroMotion, recovers and renders dynamic scenes with higher-quality reflections compared to prior work.

Our method stabilizes the scene geometry through three stages. In the static stage, we stabilize the geometry of the static scene by minimizing photometric loss Lcolor between vanilla 3DGS renders and ground truth images. The dynamic stage combines canonical 3D Gaussians G with a deformable Gaussian MLP to model dynamic scenes while simultaneously minimizing normal loss Lnormal between rendered normal map N¹ and gradient normal map from depth map D¹, thus further enhancing the overall scene geometry. Finally, the specular stage introduces a deformable reflection MLP to handle changing environment lighting, deforming reflection directions w to query a canonical environment map for specular color c. It is then combined with diffuse color ca (using zero-order spherical harmonics) and learnable specular tint Stint per 3D Gaussian to obtain the final color canal. This approach enables the modeling of dynamic specular scenes and high-quality novel view rendering. The figure illustrates the three-stage approach of SpectroMotion for dynamic specular scene reconstruction, showing the process of stabilizing scene geometry, modeling dynamic scenes, and rendering specular reflections.\n🔼 Figure 3: Normal estimation. (a) shows that flatter 3D Gaussians align better with scene surfaces, their shortest axis closely matching the surface normal. In contrast, less flat 3D Gaussians fit less accurately, with their shortest axis diverging from the surface normal. (b) shows that when the deformed 3D Gaussian becomes flatter (t = t1), normal residual Δn is rotated by R1 and scaled down by βt1/β, as flatter Gaussians require smaller normal residuals. Conversely, when the deformation results in a less flat shape (t = t2), Δn is rotated by R2 and amplified by βt2/β, requiring a larger correction to align the shortest axis with the surface normal. (c) shows how γk changes with ω (where ω = v/v for k = 1, k = 5, and k = 50. Larger ω indicates less flat Gaussians, while smaller ω represents flatter Gaussians. As k increases, γk decreases more steeply as ω rises. For k = 5, we observe a balanced behavior: γk approaches 1 for low ω and 0 for high ω, providing a nuanced penalty adjustment across different Gaussian shapes. Figure 3 illustrates the proposed method for physical normal estimation of deformed 3D Gaussians, highlighting how the approach accounts for both changes in shape and rotation during deformation.\n🔼 Figure 4: Qualitative comparison on the NeRF-DS (Yan et al., 2023) dataset.

By cleverly transforming the view consistency issue into a problem of video consistency, it can restore view-consistent details and integrate them with the original 3DGS model. The improved results make the 3DGS method far more robust and useful, especially in cases with limited data.

Instead of relying on precise, controlled settings and marker-based tracking like previous methods, ATS uses readily available videos captured in everyday environments. The key is a novel technique that reconstructs the videos into a persistent 4D representation (3D space + time), precisely tracking the agent, the scene, and the camera\u0026rsquo;s movement. This 4D data is then used to train a generative model that can predict the agent\u0026rsquo;s future actions based on its past behavior and current surroundings (what it \u0026lsquo;sees\u0026rsquo;). This model allows researchers to create interactive simulations where the agent behaves realistically and responds to changes in its environment, opening many possibilities for applications like VR/AR, robot planning, and behavior research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Agent-to-Sim (ATS) learns interactive 3D agent behavior models from casual, longitudinal videos, enabling real-to-sim transfer for various applications.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Learning agent behavior from longitudinal casual video recordings. We answer the following question: can we simulate the behavior of an agent, by learning from casually-captured videos of the same agent recorded across a long period of time (e.g., a month)? A) We first reconstruct videos in 4D (3D \u0026amp; time), which includes the scene, the trajectory of the agent, and the trajectory of the observer (i.e., camera held by the observer). Such individual 4D reconstructions are registered across time, resulting in a complete and persistent 4D representation. B) Then we learn a model of the agent for interactive behavior generation. The behavior model explicitly reasons about goals, paths, and full body movements conditioned on the agent\u0026rsquo;s ego-perception and past trajectory. Such an agent representation allows generation of novel scenarios through conditioning. For example, conditioned on different observer trajectories, the cat agent chooses to walk to the carpet, stays still while quivering his tail, or hide under the tray stand.

Please see videos results in the supplement. The figure shows the Agent-to-Sim (ATS) framework, illustrating the 4D spacetime reconstruction from longitudinal casual videos and the interactive behavior simulator that learns agent behaviors from this reconstruction.\n🔼 Figure 2: Pipeline for behavior generation. We encode egocentric information into a perception code w, conditioned on which we generate fully body motion in a hierarchical fashion. We start by generating goals Z, then paths P and finally body poses G. Each node is represented by the gradient of its log distribution, trained with denoising objectives (Eq. 8). Given G, the full body motion of an agent can be computed via blend skinning (Eq. 3). This figure illustrates the hierarchical pipeline used for generating the agent\u0026rsquo;s behavior, which involves encoding egocentric information and generating goals, paths, and body poses sequentially.\n🔼 Figure 3: Comparison on multi-video scene reconstruction. We show birds-eye-view rendering of the reconstructed scene using the bunny dataset. Compared to TotalRecon that does not register multiple videos, ATS produces higher-quality scene reconstruction. Neural localizer (NL) and featuremetric losses (FBA) are shown important for camera registration. Scene annealing is important for reconstructing a complete scene from partial video captures. Figure 3 shows a comparison of multi-video scene reconstruction results using different methods, highlighting the impact of neural localization, featuremetric losses, and scene annealing on reconstruction quality.\n🔼 Figure 4: Analysis of conditioning signals. We show results of removing one conditioning signal at a time. Removing observer conditioning and past trajectory conditioning makes the sampled goals more spread out (e.g., regions both in front of the agent and behind the agent); removing the environment conditioning introduces infeasible goals that penetrate the ground and the walls. Figure 4 shows an ablation study on the effect of conditioning signals for goal generation, demonstrating that all three signals (user, past trajectory, and environment) contribute to generating realistic goals.\n🔼 Figure 5: Results of 4D reconstruction. Top: reference images and renderings. Background color represents correspondence. Colored blobs on the cat represent B = 25 bones (e.g., head is represented by the yellow blob). The magenta colored lines represents reconstructed trajectories of each blob in the world space. Bottom: Bird’s eye view of the reconstructed scene and agent trajectories, registered to the same scene coordinate. Each colored line represents a unique video sequence where boxes and spheres indicate the starting and the end location. The figure shows the results of a 4D reconstruction of an agent (cat) and its environment from multiple video sequences, displaying both individual frames and a bird\u0026rsquo;s-eye view of the registered trajectories.\n🔼 Figure 6: Qualitative comparison with TotalRecon (Song et al., 2023) on 4D reconstruction. Top: reconstruction of the agent at at specific frame. Total-recon produces shapes with missing limbs and bone transformations that are misaligned with the shape, while our method produces complete shapes and good alignment. Bottom: reconstruction of the environment. TotalRecon produces distorted and incomplete geometry (due to lack of observations from a single video), while our method produces an accurate and complete environment reconstruction. Figure 6 shows a qualitative comparison of 4D reconstruction results between the proposed method and TotalRecon, highlighting the superior quality of shape, alignment, and completeness achieved by the proposed method.\n🔼 Figure 7: Qualitative comparison on 4D reconstruction (Tab. 3). We compare with TotalRecon on 4D reconstruction quality. We show novel views rendered with a held-out camera that looks from the opposite side. ATS is able to leverage multiple videos captured at different times to reconstruct the wall (blue box) and the tripod stand (red box) even they are not visible in the input views. Multi-video TotalRecon produces blurry RGB and depth due to bad camera registration. The original TotalRecon takes a single video as input and therefore fails to reconstruct the regions (the tripod and the wall) that are not visible in the input video. Figure 7 shows a qualitative comparison of 4D reconstruction results between ATS and TotalRecon, highlighting ATS\u0026rsquo;s ability to leverage multiple videos for improved reconstruction of scene details even when those details are not visible in any single video.\n🔼 Figure 8: Visual ablation on scene awareness. We demonstrate the effect of the scene code (\\boldsymbol{\\omega}_s) through goal-conditioned path generation (bird’s-eye-view, blue sphere goal; gradient color generated path; gray blocks locations that have been visited in the training data). Conditioned on scene, the generated path abide by the scene geometry, while removing the scene code, the generated paths go through the wall in between two empty spaces. Figure 8 shows the impact of scene awareness on path generation, demonstrating that incorporating scene information prevents the generated path from going through walls.\n🔼 Figure 9: Given the 3D trajectories of the agent and the user accumulated over time (top), one could compute their preference represented by 3D heatmaps (bottom). Note the high agent preference over table and sofa. Figure 9 shows agent and user\u0026rsquo;s preference over the environment represented by 3D heatmaps generated from their accumulated trajectories.\n🔼 Figure 11: Generalization ability of the behavior model. Thanks to the ego-centric encoding design (Eq. 12), a specific behavior can be learned and generalized to novel situations even it was seen once. Although there\u0026rsquo;s only one data point where the cat jumps off the dining table, our method can generate diverse motion of cat jumping off the table while landing at different locations (to the left, middle, and right of the table) as shown in the visual. The figure shows the generalization ability of the behavior model to generate diverse motions of a cat jumping off a table and landing at different locations, even with limited training data.\n🔼 Figure 1: Learning agent behavior from longitudinal casual video recordings. We answer the following question: can we simulate the behavior of an agent, by learning from casually-captured videos of the same agent recorded across a long period of time (e.g., a month)?

We find our camera localization to be robust to layout changes, e.g., the cushion and the large boxes (left) and the box (right). However, it fails to reconstruct layout changes, especially when they are only observed in a few views. The figure shows the robustness of the camera localization method to changes in the environment layout, highlighting its limitations when dealing with changes only observed in a few views.\nMore on tables 🔽 Table 3: Evaluation of 4D Reconstruction.

Alchemy produced a large number of new theorems (millions, compared to the existing tens of thousands). These new theorems were then used to train large language models (LLMs). The results demonstrated a noticeable performance improvement on standard benchmarks for theorem proving, both for theorems similar to the ones used for training (in-distribution) and for theorems of a different type (out-of-distribution), highlighting the technique\u0026rsquo;s potential value. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Alchemy amplifies theorem-proving by synthesizing new mathematical theorems, improving model performance.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: The overview of our synthesis pipeline.

It addresses the issue that existing datasets don\u0026rsquo;t ensure LLMs generate hallucinations before editing, making it hard to assess the true effectiveness of knowledge editing. HalluEditBench creates a large dataset of real-world LLM hallucinations and evaluates editing methods across five dimensions: Efficacy (how well it fixes hallucinations), Generalization (how well the fix applies to different questions), Portability (how well the fix works in related questions), Locality (whether the fix affects unrelated knowledge), and Robustness (how resistant the fix is to manipulation). The study reveals that the effectiveness of knowledge editing is highly dependent on both the LLM and the domain, with parameter-preserving methods showing more robustness but lower generalization. This benchmark provides valuable insights into knowledge editing\u0026rsquo;s potentials and limitations, guiding future research in improving these methods. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To summarize the research paper on knowledge editing for correcting hallucinations in LLMs, providing a catchy summary, TL;DR, key takeaways, and its importance to researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Framework of HalluEditBench.

Traditional methods struggle with slow training and overfitting. FrugalNeRF cleverly uses weight-sharing voxels at multiple scales to efficiently represent scene details. A key innovation is its cross-scale geometric adaptation: it identifies the most accurate depth from different scales using reprojection errors, effectively creating pseudo ground truth without external data. This approach speeds up training and improves accuracy, outperforming other methods. Experiments show FrugalNeRF is dramatically faster and produces better results on standard datasets. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on FrugalNeRF, a novel few-shot novel view synthesis method.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1.

Comparisons between few-shot NeRF approaches. (a) Frequency regularization gradually increases the visibility of high-frequency signals of positional encoding, but the training speed is slow. (b) Replacing the MLPs with voxels and incorporating them with gradual voxel upsampling achieves similar frequency regularization but cannot generalize well. (c) Some approaches employ pre-trained models to supervise the rendered color or depth patches. (d) Our FrugalNeRF, leveraging weight-sharing voxels across scales for various frequencies representation, enhanced by a cross-scale geometric adaptation for efficient supervision. Figure 2 compares different few-shot NeRF approaches, highlighting FrugalNeRF\u0026rsquo;s efficient use of weight-sharing voxels and cross-scale geometric adaptation for faster convergence and improved generalization.\n🔼 Figure 3. Overview of FrugalNeRF architecture. (a) Our FrugalNeRF represents a scene with a pair of density and appearance voxels (VD, VA). For a better graphical illustration, we show only one voxel in the figure. (b) We sample rays from not only training input views rtrain but also randomly sampled novel views rnovel. (c) We then create L + 1 multi-scale voxels by hierarchical subsampling, where lower-resolution voxels ensure global geometry consistency and reduce overfitting but suffer from representing detailed structures, while higher-resolution voxels capture fine details but may get stuck in the local minimum or generate floaters. (d) For the rays from training views rtrain, we enforce an MSE reconstruction loss between the volume rendered RGB color Ĉ and input RGB C at each scale. (e) We introduce a cross-scale geometric adaptation loss for novel view rays rnovel, warping volume-rendered RGB to the nearest training view using predicted depth, calculating projection errors e\u0026rsquo; at each scale, and using the depth with the minimum reprojection error as pseudo-GT for depth supervision. This adaptation involves rays from both training and novel views, though the figure only depicts novel view rays for clarity. Figure 3 illustrates the FrugalNeRF architecture, showcasing its multi-scale voxel representation, ray sampling strategy, training loss functions, and cross-scale geometric adaptation mechanism.\n🔼 Figure 1.

Cross-scale geometric adaptation in training. (Left) In the early training phase, low-resolution voxels primarily act as pseudo-ground truth, guiding the model’s geometric learning. As training goes on, medium- and high-resolution voxels increasingly contribute to refining scene geometry. This adaptive approach enables the model to autonomously tune into appropriate frequencies at each stage, enhancing its ability to generalize across various scenes. (Right) Without geometric adaptation, all of the scales result in sub-optimal solutions. Geometric adaptation drives convergence to higher quality across all scales. The chart visualizes how the proportion of each voxel scale serving as pseudo-ground truth changes during training, demonstrating the cross-scale geometric adaptation process in FrugalNeRF.\n🔼 Figure 1.

Current methods often rely on limited data with short answers, hindering the models\u0026rsquo; ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. The researchers propose a two-step solution. First, they use the powerful GPT-4 language model to generate detailed explanations (rationales) for answers, enriching the training dataset. Second, they employ reinforcement learning to further refine the models\u0026rsquo; reasoning abilities, focusing on aligning the models\u0026rsquo; generated rationales with the correct answers. Experiments show this approach significantly improves the VLM\u0026rsquo;s performance on various reasoning tasks, highlighting the importance of detailed rationales in VLM training and demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning for enhancing reasoning capabilities. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper introduces a novel two-fold approach to enhance chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs).

In the lower figure, generating CoT for prediction provides the additional benefit of reasoning alignment, allowing the model to improve by leveraging self-generated data. This figure illustrates the difference between training a vision language model exclusively on short answers versus incorporating chain-of-thought reasoning for improved accuracy and alignment.\n🔼 Figure 3: The distribution of word counts for CoT and direct answer. The chart displays the distribution of word counts in chain-of-thought (CoT) answers and direct answers.\n🔽 Table 2: SFT experiments with data composition in fig. 5: ① format alignment only, ② direct responses only, ③ CoT responses only and ④ both direct and CoT responses.

Contrary to the belief that LLMs perform calculations like humans, the researchers found that LLMs learn arithmetic symbolically. They don\u0026rsquo;t use partial products in the way humans do; instead, they identify patterns within subgroups of data. The difficulty of an arithmetic task depends on the complexity and selection of these subgroups, which are characterized by label space entropy and subgroup quality. Interestingly, LLM accuracy follows a U-shaped curve across different positions within a numerical sequence – they perform well on the beginning and end digits but struggle with middle digits. This is because easier patterns are learned first, leaving the more complex patterns in the middle to be learned later. Overall, the study shows LLMs are symbolic learners, emphasizing the importance of understanding them through subgroup-level quantification. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) learn arithmetic.

Compound AI systems combine LLMs with other components like retrievers or code interpreters, making their behavior highly dependent on parameters like instructions or tool definitions. Traditionally, these parameters are tuned manually, which is time-consuming and challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses an LLM as the optimizer. This is efficient because LLMs can directly generate optimized parameters, avoiding the need for computationally expensive gradient calculations. The survey categorizes optimization approaches based on the analogy of program analysis. Static analysis involves optimizing based on the system\u0026rsquo;s structure without runtime execution, while dynamic analysis considers the system\u0026rsquo;s runtime behavior. The paper also explores various applications of this LLM-based optimization across different compound AI systems, including question-answering, mathematical problem-solving, and sequential decision making. The authors emphasize the broader implications of this approach, including improved process supervision and enhanced safety in AI systems. This method offers a way to better manage the complexity of compound AI systems, resulting in more robust and efficient AI applications. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This JSON contains a summary of the research paper on LLM-based optimization of compound AI systems.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Organization of this survey.

Given an image I with object Or, we crop Or and paste it to various spatial positions {v1, \u0026hellip;, vk} within a pre-defined template. For every pasting position, we ask two LVLMs (Fb and Fr) if object Or is in this template, where Fb refers to a baseline model that follows raster-scan positional alignment strategy and Fr refers to a model that resorts to reversal raster-scan position alignment strategy. The total number of correct responses at different pasting positions {v1, \u0026hellip;, vk} is reported in (a) and (b), which refers to results from model Fb and Fr, respectively. We observe that LVLM Fb are more likely to generate correct responses when pasting object Or to lower region, while Fr are less hallucinated when pasting object Or to upper region. Pasting positions with the most and the least correct responses are highlighted in solid-line and dotted-line red boxes. More details are provided in Appendix C.1. Best viewed in color.

Unlike previous models primarily focused on English and Western contexts, PANGEA excels in handling 39 diverse languages and their associated cultural nuances. Its training utilized PANGEAINS, a massive 6-million-instruction dataset, ensuring high-quality English instructions and careful machine translations. Performance was rigorously evaluated on PANGEABENCH, a comprehensive evaluation suite covering 14 datasets across 47 languages. PANGEA\u0026rsquo;s results demonstrated significantly better performance than current open-source models in multilingual settings, especially when considering cross-cultural contexts. The researchers highlight the significance of balanced English data representation and the number of multimodal training samples, impacting performance. Crucially, the entire project—data, code, and model—is open-sourced to promote equity and accessibility in multilingual AI development. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # PANGEA is a fully open multilingual, multimodal large language model (LLM) trained on a massive dataset spanning 39 languages, significantly outperforming existing open-source models in multilingual settings and diverse cultural contexts.

It provides a better interface than existing systems, allowing machine learning models to more effectively search for and construct mathematical proofs. Key improvements include support for advanced reasoning steps, more robust handling of complex search scenarios, and efficient extraction of data for training machine learning models. The authors demonstrate the tool\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness by implementing the \u0026lsquo;Draft-Sketch-Proof\u0026rsquo; approach in Lean 4, a method that first generates a high-level proof outline and then fills in the details. Their experiments show that this approach, using large language models, achieves a notable success rate in proving theorems from the MiniF2F benchmark. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Pantograph is a novel machine-to-machine interface for Lean 4, enabling efficient proof search and high-level reasoning, paving the way for more advanced machine learning models in theorem proving.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Fig. 1: A proof tree for Expression (1) The figure shows a proof tree for the expression representing the commutativity of logical OR, illustrating the structure generated by applying tactics in a proof assistant.\n🔼 Fig. 6: Hammer invocations and runtimes of DSP on the validation and test sets of MiniF2F using the GPT-40 model.

Unlike typical knowledge distillation applied after training, PD directly incorporates knowledge transfer during the initial training. The researchers systematically explore the design space of PD by considering four key factors: logits processing, loss function selection, the scaling law between model sizes, and whether logits are generated offline (from a pre-trained teacher model) or online (simultaneously during teacher training). Experiments using the GLM language model showed that PD consistently improved student model performance compared to traditional pre-training methods. They found that larger student models benefit more from PD and that efficient logit truncation methods are essential for handling the massive data involved. They also found that a careful balance between distillation loss and standard language modeling loss is necessary for optimal results. Overall, the study highlights the effectiveness of PD and provides valuable insights into its design space, potentially informing future research in large language model training and optimization. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This JSON contains a summary of the research paper on pre-training distillation for large language models.

The researchers tested nearly 40 reward models, finding that even the best-performing ones struggle, especially with style bias; average performance was only 46.6%, which is worse than random chance. This highlights the need for better reward models. Importantly, RM-BENCH shows a strong correlation with actual language model performance, making it a useful tool for researchers selecting reward models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise and informative summary of the research paper on benchmarking reward models for language models, highlighting its key contributions, findings, and implications for researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: The construction process of chosen response yc and rejected response yr for each domain in RM-BENCH (Section 3.1 to 3.3).

Prompt: What happened to Schr�dinger's cat?Chosen ResponseRejected Response⌀ ySchr�dinger's cat is a thought experiment illustrating quantum superposition, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed.Schr�dinger's cat is a thought experiment illustrating quantum entanglement, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed.yLSchrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935. It il- lustrates quantum superposition in quantum mechan- ics, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed, highlighting the paradox of quantum states in macro- scopic objects. The experiment is metaphorical and not real, but emphasizes quantum theory.Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrodinger to highlight quantum entangle- ment in quantum mechanics. It illustrates a paradox where a cat is both alive and dead until observed. This paradox highlights the perplexing nature of quantum theory and entanglement.yL,MSchrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate ** quantum superposition**. ### Explanation: The experiment involves a cat in a sealed box, along with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, poison, and a hammer. The atom has a 50% chance of decaying, and ifit does, the hammer breaks the vial, killing the cat. According to **quantum mechanics**, the atom exists in a superposition of decayed and not decayed states, and thus, the cat is both **alive and dead** until the box is opened and the cat is observed. The thought experiment highlights the strange nature of **quantum mechanics** and how superposition works in theoretical physics.Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate **quantum entanglement**. ### The Experiment: A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, poison is released, killing the cat. According to **quantum theory**, the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened, representing a paradox in entanglement and quantum theory. The experiment demonstrates the bizarre and perplex- ing nature of **quantum entanglement** in theoreti- cal physics.Why RejectThe rejected response is incorrect because Schrodinger's cat illustrates quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement. Quantum superposition refers to the cat being in two states (alive and dead) simultaneously until observed. Quantum entanglement, however, refers to the linking of two particles in such a way that the state of one directly affects the other, which is not the core concept of the Schrodinger's cat experiment.

Prompt: Find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)).Chosen ResponseRejected ResponseyTo solve the problem, we need to find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)). . . Thus, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1... We need to find values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal � /2 + k�. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = 0, so x = 0. The function f(x) is defined for all x in the interval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0,1].To solve the problem, we need to find the do- main of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)). The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1, which simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. · To avoid arccos(x2) = �/2, we must have x2 + 1. Therefore, x must be in the interval [-1,1) or (-1, 1]. Thus, the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)) is [-1,1).yLTo find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(�/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. The func- tion f(x) is defined for all x in the interval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0, 1].To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �/2].. . Domain of tan(�): The function tan(0) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. Combining the con- ditions:We need to ensure that arccos(x2) + 元/2. This implies x2 ≠ 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. Therefore, x must be in the interval [-1,1). Thus, the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)) is [-1,1).yl,mTo find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. ### Domain of tan(0): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except where 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. ### Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Since arccos(x2) ranges from 0 to �, the only problematic value is arccos(x2) = �/2. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(元/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. ### Final domain: The function f(x) tan(arccos(x2)) is defined for all x in the in- terval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0,1]. So, the final answer is [-1,0)U(0,1]To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined if -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1]. ### Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �]. Specifically, since x2 is in [0, 1], arccos(x2) will return values in [0, �/2]. ### Domain of tan(�): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2+ k� for any integer k. ### Combining the conditions: We need to en- sure that arccos(x2) ≠ �/2. This implies x2 + 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. ### Final domain: Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1) to avoid arccos(x2) = �/2. This means x must be in the interval [-1,1)or(-1,1].

SAM 2 uses a \u0026lsquo;memory module\u0026rsquo; to remember previous frames and improve predictions, but its greedy approach struggles with long videos, complex scenes, and objects that reappear after being hidden. SAM2Long solves this by using a \u0026lsquo;memory tree\u0026rsquo; – it keeps track of several possible segmentation paths simultaneously, selecting the best path at the end. This makes SAM2Long far more resilient to errors that accumulate over long videos. Importantly, SAM2Long doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any extra training data or parameters – it\u0026rsquo;s a purely algorithmic improvement. Experiments on several benchmark datasets consistently show SAM2Long\u0026rsquo;s improvements over SAM 2, especially in handling long, complex sequences. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the research paper on SAM2Long: Enhancing SAM 2 for Long Video Segmentation with a Training-Free Memory Tree.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Comparison of occlusion handling and long-term compatibility between SAM 2 and SAM2Long.

(b) The per-frame J\u0026amp;F scores of the predicted masks are plotted at specific timestamps on the LVOS and SA-V datasets. SAM2Long demonstrates greater resilience to elapsed time compared to SAM 2, maintaining superior performance over longer periods.

The input frame is processed through the mask decoder conditioned on the memory bank, generating three mask candidates for each pathway. The candidates with the highest updated cumulative scores Sp,k[t] are carried forward to the next time step. (b) Mask selection with uncertainty handling: When the maximum absolute occlusion score exceeds the threshold δconf (Certain), the high-scoring mask is selected. Otherwise (Uncertain), distinct mask candidates are picked to avoid incorrect convergence.

The problem is that existing methods for creating datasets for training these models often result in low-quality data, which hinders performance. GATEAU addresses this by using two novel techniques: Homologous Models\u0026rsquo; Guidance (HMG) and Contextual Awareness Measurement (CAM). HMG uses the difference in perplexity scores between two similar models with different context window sizes to identify samples with complex long-range dependencies. CAM assesses whether the model\u0026rsquo;s attention mechanism focuses on the important parts of the input text, also identifying challenging samples. By combining these two measures, GATEAU selects the most challenging samples, resulting in a higher-quality training dataset. Experiments demonstrate that LLMs trained on the dataset created using GATEAU achieve significantly better performance on various benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of the method in improving both instruction-following and long-context understanding abilities. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To help researchers quickly grasp the core contributions and significance of the research paper on selecting influential samples for long-context alignment.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: An overview of our framework GATEAU.

This paper introduces SPARE, a novel method that addresses this issue without requiring any retraining of the LLM. SPARE leverages sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to identify and modify internal LLM activations that influence knowledge selection. SAEs decompose complex LLM activations into simpler, more interpretable features. By carefully manipulating these features, SPARE can guide the LLM to prioritize either the contextual information or its internal knowledge, effectively resolving conflicts. Experiments on question-answering tasks show that SPARE significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy, demonstrating the effectiveness of this approach in resolving knowledge conflicts and enhancing LLM performance. The method is highly efficient, operating at inference time without the need for model retraining. This makes SPARE a practical solution for improving LLM performance in real-world applications where knowledge conflicts are common. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To summarize the research paper on steering knowledge selection behaviours in LLMs using SAE-based representation engineering.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: In the event of a knowledge conflict, the model can rely on the context or on the parametric knowledge.

Unlike previous models that used thousands of visual tokens to describe a video, BLIP-3-Video cleverly uses a \u0026rsquo;temporal encoder\u0026rsquo; to represent a video using only 32 tokens. This drastically reduces computation while maintaining or improving accuracy in tasks like answering questions about videos. Experiments show it performs similarly to much larger models, highlighting its efficiency. Different types of temporal encoders were explored, with attentional pooling showing the best results. The model was trained in stages, starting with image captioning, then video captioning, and finally video question answering using multiple datasets.

This paper addresses this by focusing on the training process itself, rather than post-hoc fixes. The researchers analyzed the relationship between training and hallucinations, observing fluctuations in accuracy over training epochs. They introduced Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND), a training technique that identifies and removes neurons which cause high variability in the model\u0026rsquo;s output (sensitive neurons). They also developed a faster metric (Efficient EigenScore) to measure hallucinations. Experiments showed SeND improves LLM accuracy on datasets like Wikipedia and medical data by up to 40% compared to standard training, demonstrating that addressing the training process directly can substantially reduce hallucination. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise and informative summary of the research paper on hallucination mitigation in large language models (LLMs) using Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND).\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Visualization of Oscillatory Behavior Across Varying LLM Sizes. Hallucination metrics are evaluated at equidistant checkpoints of the Pythia models, with sizes 70M, 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B. Part (a) presents the performance of the Pythia models under the SelfCheckGPT metric. Average performance is indicated by solid lines, while the shaded regions represent the standard deviation. Higher SelfCheckGPT score indicates a higher probability of self-contradiction and higher probability of confabulation. Part (b) depicts the same experimental setup, but hallucination measured on the XSum v2 dataset, where Rouge1 is used as the performance metric. A higher Rouge1 score suggests a better alignment of the generated text to that of the reference summary. For all model sizes, we observe a pronounced trend of high variance and oscillatory behavior in hallucination rates. This fluctuation highlights the models\u0026rsquo; uncertainty at specific time stamps and emphasizes the need for a robust mitigation strategy to stabilize performance during training. Figure 1 visualizes the oscillatory behavior of hallucination metrics across various sizes of LLMs during training, highlighting high variance and uncertainty in model performance.\n🔽 Figure 4: Regular finetuning vs. SeND on two datasets.

In both plots, performance is reported as the average EES over 5 runs on the validation set. Models are trained until loss convergence. Training with SeND shows a more controlled reduction in EES compared to regular finetuning, suggesting that SeND optimizes for hallucinations as well as loss, with less overall confidence variability during training. Since finetuning without dropout consistently achieves better factual consistency than random dropout in our experiments, we compare SeND directly with standard finetuning.

Input size for each test is 80 I.I.D. texts. Sensitive neuron dropping presents a clear, significant reduction in EigenScore compared to that of random neuron dropping across model sizes. Hallucinatory generations experience a larger drop in EigenScore, meaning that our protocol scales with likelihood of hallucination. The chart compares the effect of sensitive neuron dropout versus random neuron dropout on EigenScore, showing significant reduction in hallucination likelihood with sensitive neuron dropout, especially in hallucinatory outputs.\n🔼 Figure 3: Efficient EigenScore approximation scaling investigation.

The x-axis represents the product of the matrix\u0026rsquo;s rows and columns, and the y-axis shows the computation time.

The study systematically evaluates various RMs across 23 typologically diverse languages, encompassing tasks related to chat, safety, reasoning, and translation. A key finding is a significant performance gap between English and non-English languages, showing that RM preferences vary substantially across languages. The researchers also found that better translation quality improves RM performance, and high-resource languages yield better results. This highlights a critical need for further research into cross-lingual RM development and evaluation. The M-REWARDBENCH dataset and code are publicly released to facilitate future research in this area. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on multilingual reward model evaluation.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Performance gap between RewardBench (English) and the average M-REWARDBENCH scores across 23 languages for various reward models (Pearson r: 0.92, Spearman p: 0.89).

Existing methods often use either acoustic tokens from audio codecs or semantic tokens from self-supervised learning models, but lack contextual information which is crucial for comprehension. DM-Codec overcomes this by employing two novel distillation techniques: a language model (LM)-guided approach and a combined LM and self-supervised speech model (SM)-guided approach. These methods effectively integrate acoustic, semantic, and contextual features into a streamlined encoder-decoder framework with a residual vector quantizer. Experiments on the LibriSpeech benchmark demonstrate DM-Codec\u0026rsquo;s superiority over state-of-the-art models, significantly reducing Word Error Rate (WER) and Word Information Lost (WIL) while improving speech quality and intelligibility. The approach is innovative because it efficiently combines multiple data modalities to provide a comprehensive speech representation. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise and informative summary of the research paper on DM-Codec, highlighting its key contributions, findings, and implications for researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: An overview of speech tokenization approaches using discrete acoustic, semantic, and contextual tokens.

Instead of computationally intensive methods (training numerous models with varying datasets), this paper proposes MIMETIC2, an efficient approach using existing models and readily available data. Experiments across two domains (human faces and art styles) found imitation thresholds surprisingly low (200-600 images).

The figure shows four concepts (e.g., Van Gogh\u0026rsquo;s art style) that have different counts in the training data (e.g., 213K for Van Gogh). As the image count of a concept increases, the ability of the text-to-image model to imitate it increases (e.g. Piet Mondrian and Van Gogh). We propose an efficient approach, MIMETIC2, that estimates the imitation threshold without training models from scratch.

Concepts with zero image frequencies are shaded with light gray. We show the mean imitation score and its variance over the five image generation prompts. The red vertical line indicates the imitation threshold found by the change detection algorithm, and the horizontal green line represents the average imitation scores before and after the threshold.

In Step 1, we estimate the frequency of each concept (belonging to a domain) in the pretraining data by obtaining the images that contain the concept of interest. In Step 2, we use the filtered images of each concept (obtained in Step 1) and compare them to the generated images to measure imitation (using g that receives training and generated images). We repeat this process for each concept to generate the imitation score graph, and then determine the imitation threshold with a change detection algorithm.

The authors find that while detectors achieve impressive accuracy on benchmark datasets, their performance significantly drops in real-world applications. This discrepancy is attributed to the poor quality of the evaluation datasets themselves. The paper emphasizes the need for robust and qualitative methods to evaluate datasets used for training AI detectors. The researchers systematically review existing datasets used in AI-generated content detection competitions and propose methods for evaluating dataset quality. They suggest that using high-quality generated data is essential for training better detectors and improving datasets. The paper contributes to a better understanding of the complex relationship between human-written and machine-generated text, which is critical for maintaining information integrity in the digital age. In essence, the paper calls for increased attention to dataset quality and suggests methods for improving both the datasets and the AI detectors. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This JSON provides a summary of the research paper focusing on the quality of datasets used for AI-generated text detection.

Unlike other models that focus on either generation or representation, BiGR does both simultaneously. It uses compact binary codes to represent images, making it efficient and versatile. The model is trained using a masked modeling approach, where parts of the image\u0026rsquo;s code are hidden and the model must predict them. This approach helps improve the image\u0026rsquo;s overall representation. Experiments showed that BiGR outperformed existing methods in both generating images and creating good representations, measured by FID-50k and linear-probe accuracy. BiGR also excels at zero-shot generalization, meaning it can be used for various tasks (like image inpainting or editing) without any additional training. The use of binary codes also increases efficiency, generating images much faster than similar models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on BiGR, a novel conditional image generation model using compact binary latent codes, for researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: BiGR generates high-quality images while improving the discriminative capabilities of the representations. Left: Generated 512×512 samples, 256x256 samples, and class-conditional editing samples. Right: BiGR vs. LlamaGen (Sun et al., 2024). We visualize image features from 100 classes in ImageNet-1K validation split using t-SNE (van der Maaten \u0026amp; Hinton, 2008), where the same color indicates the same class. Our model produces features with greater discriminative separability and enhances both generative and discriminative performance. Figure 1 shows BiGR generating high-quality images while simultaneously enhancing the discriminative capabilities of its visual representations, as demonstrated through image samples and t-SNE visualizations of image features.\n🔼 Figure 3: Relationships between FID-50K and sample time across varying inference hyperparameters. We compare different numbers of sampling iterations (N) on the left and varying diffusion timesteps (T) on the right for three model sizes. The chart shows the relationship between FID-50k score and sample time for different numbers of sampling iterations and diffusion timesteps, across three model sizes.\n🔽 Table 1: Uniformity comparison.

For simplicity, we display only 1 bit for each token, although each token actually consists of K bits in length. Left: We outline the training of BiGR. Starting with binary codes from binary tokenizers, we append a condition token and mask partial tokens. These tokens are projected into continuous embeddings and processed by the Llama backbone. The outputs undergo a Bernoulli denoising process in the binary transcoder to generate probabilities, penalized by the weighted binary cross-entropy loss (wBCE) at masked positions. Right: We illustrate the generation process (detailed in Sec. 3.3) and the representation acquisition via average pooling. Figure 2 illustrates the training and generation processes of the BiGR model, highlighting the use of binary latent codes, masked modeling, and a Bernoulli diffusion process for both tasks.\n🔼 Figure 1: BiGR generates high-quality images while improving the discriminative capabilities of the representations.

This paper introduces EvoPress, a new method for compressing LLMs more effectively. Existing methods typically compress models uniformly, but EvoPress dynamically adjusts the compression level for different parts of the model (e.g., layers or blocks). This allows for better performance since some parts of the model are more important than others and don\u0026rsquo;t need as much compression. EvoPress uses an evolutionary search algorithm that explores different compression strategies and finds the best one. The researchers demonstrate that EvoPress consistently outperforms other methods on several benchmark LLMs. They also prove that their algorithm converges to an optimal solution, meaning it is guaranteed to find a good compression strategy. This is important because other similar methods often rely on assumptions that may not always be true. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # EvoPress uses evolutionary search to optimize dynamic model compression for LLMs, achieving state-of-the-art results across various compression methods.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Removing twelve transformer blocks from Llama-3-8B under the constraint that only pairs of consecutive blocks can be removed.

The researchers tested this by training many image classification models, all with the same structure and data but varying training techniques (like adding extra noise to training images or using self-supervised learning). They then measured which parts (or layers) of the models were essential for making correct predictions. The key finding is that different training methods make different parts of the model more important. For example, models trained with improved techniques relied heavily on the early layers, while models trained with adversarial methods relied more on deeper layers. The study provides a more nuanced understanding of how neural networks work, especially in showing how the training process itself can deeply affect a model\u0026rsquo;s functionality. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The paper investigates how different training methods affect which parts of a vision model are actually crucial for its decisions.

We measure the criticality of fifty different ResNet-50-based models that all utilize the same exact network architecture and training data (ImageNet-1k) but differ in their training methods.

Brighter spots are auxiliary, i.e., resetting these layers does not significantly affect the model. We denote the average (mean±std) layer criticality for both, a model across layers on the right, for a layer across model on the bottom. The figure shows how different training methods affect which layers of a ResNet-50 model are critical to the model\u0026rsquo;s decision-making process.\n🔼 Figure 2: Adversarial training increases the average criticality proportional to the training attack budget ε. We ablate l∞ from l2-norm training but do not observe any significant differences in their trends. The marker size in the plot indicates the validation accuracy on ImageNet-1k (larger is better). The chart shows that adversarial training increases the average criticality of layers in a neural network proportionally to the attack budget, with minimal difference observed between l2 and l∞ norm attacks.\n🔽 Table 1: An overview of the utilized models (training strategies) in our study.

PositiveNegative[Instruction]: What is the most efficient way to transport a given package across a city, considering traffic congestion, distance, and cost? [Response]: The most efficient way to transport a pack- age across a city depends on several factors, including the package\u0026rsquo;s size, weight, fragility, and urgency, as well as the city\u0026rsquo;s traffic patterns, infrastructure, and regulations. Here are some general considerations and options to minimize costs, reduce congestion, and ensure timely delivery: 1. Distance and Route Optimization: * Use online route planners or transportation manage- ment software to determine the shortest and most efficient route. * Consider alternative routes or modes of transportation if the primary route is congested or closed. 2. Traffic Congestion Mitigation: * Avoid peak hours (7-9 am and 4-6 pm) when possible, as traffic congestion is typically highest during these times\u0026hellip;[Instruction]: Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in 100 words. [Response]: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require hu- man intelligence, such as learning, problem- solving, and decision-making. AI systems use algorithms and data to analyze and interpret in- formation, allowing them to make predictions, classify objects, and generate insights. They can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance over time, and can even adapt to new situations and learn from experience. AI has many applications, including robotics, nat- ural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems, and is increasingly being used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.[Instruction]: Can you write a script for a public service announcement about the importance of recycling?

This paper introduces NaturalBench, a new benchmark using \u0026rsquo;natural adversarial samples\u0026rsquo;—images and questions easy for humans but difficult for VLMs. These samples are semi-automatically generated using CLIP and ChatGPT. NaturalBench includes 10,000 human-verified samples and a novel design preventing \u0026lsquo;blind\u0026rsquo; solutions (those not using image information). Testing 53 VLMs reveals a substantial performance gap (50-70%) between VLMs and humans. The paper analyzes this performance gap from two perspectives: compositionality (VLMs lack diverse visio-linguistic skills) and bias (VLMs often choose the same answer regardless of the image). NaturalBench\u0026rsquo;s methodology is flexible, adapting easily to different data sources and languages for dynamic evaluations, ensuring it remains a relevant tool for future VLM research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The paper introduces NaturalBench, a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) that uses naturally occurring adversarial samples, which are images and questions that humans can easily answer but current VLMs struggle with. This benchmark addresses limitations of existing benchmarks by preventing \u0026lsquo;blind\u0026rsquo; solutions that don\u0026rsquo;t use the image. It\u0026rsquo;s shown to be more challenging than previous benchmarks and reveals significant biases in current VLMs.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: NaturalBench examples consist of two questions and two images with alternating answers to prevent \u0026lsquo;blind\u0026rsquo; models from scoring well (e.g., those that predict the same answer regardless of the image or question, as discussed in Section 3). We compare the ground-truth answer for each (image, question) pair with predictions from leading VLMs including GPT-40 (gpt-40-2024-08-06), Qwen2-VL (72B), Llama3.2-Vision (90B), and Molmo (72B) (see Section 4). Even the best models like GPT-40 lags far behind human performance (which is above 90%). Figure 2 shows the pipeline for collecting these natural adversarial examples. Figure 1 shows examples from NaturalBench, a new benchmark for evaluating vision-language models, highlighting the difficulty of the task even for state-of-the-art models compared to human performance.\n🔼 Figure 4: Performance of GPT-3.5 vs. LLaVA-1.5 on previous VQA benchmarks. We split each benchmark into equal-sized training and test sets, and report zero-shot (in blue) and finetuned (in green) results. Previous benchmarks show strong language biases, allowing blind GPT-3.5 to exploit spurious answer patterns (see Section 4) by finetuning on QA data without images. As a result, blind GPT-3.5 greatly surpasses random chance (see the red dotted line) and sometimes even matches the performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B finetuned using images. In contrast, Figure 5 shows that NaturalBench can effectively prevent blind solutions from exceeding chance. The chart compares the performance of GPT-3.5 and LLaVA-1.5 models on several existing VQA benchmarks, highlighting the susceptibility of these benchmarks to language biases that allow blind models to achieve high accuracy without image understanding.\n🔽 Table 2: Debiased performance on NaturalBench. Many models underperform on NaturalBench due to biases towards certain answers like “Yes” and “B”. To illustrate this, we compute a debiased Q-Acc by adjusting the prediction threshold (as described in Section 5) to ensure the model predict different answers for the two images of the same question. Similarly, debiased I-Acc ensures different predicted answers for the two questions of the same image. For debiased G-Acc, we tune the threshold so that the model predicts one answer for two (out of four) image-question pairs, and a different answer for the other two pairs. The substantial performance gains of these metrics suggest that proper debiasing can greatly improve performance. Our Appendix evaluates existing debiasing techniques that do not require prior knowledge of image-question pairings.

This paper introduces Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT), a novel method that trains LLMs to both resist harmful persuasion and accept helpful persuasion. PBT uses multi-agent recursive dialogue trees to create training data, teaching models to assess when persuasion is beneficial or harmful. Results show PBT improves resistance to misinformation and resilience to challenges, leading to better overall performance than models focused solely on resisting or accepting persuasion. Crucially, PBT enhances collaboration in multi-agent settings by reducing the impact of the order in which models present arguments. The study also found that model decisions are primarily driven by the plausibility of the alternative answer, rather than its perceived confidence. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This research paper explores how large language models (LLMs) can be made more resilient to manipulation while also being more receptive to helpful suggestions.

However, only optimizing one or the other can lead to overcorrection. We argue that the two must be balanced, i.e. the agent should resist and accept persuasion when appropriate. The figure illustrates the importance of balancing resisting negative persuasion with accepting positive persuasion in large language models for productive dialogues.\n🔼 Figure 3: Accuracy of a team after discussion. A strong model (Llama 3.1 70B) paired with a weaker model (Llama 3.1 8B) leads to order dependence. Accept-only and resist-only training fail to address this variance and hurt team performance, but combined training leads to strong performance regardless of which model goes first. The chart displays the impact of different training methods (base, accept-only, resist-only, and PBT) on the performance of multi-agent teams composed of a strong and a weak model, showing how the order of speakers affects the outcome and how PBT training mitigates this effect.\n🔽 Table 1: Rate at which models adopt misinformation across different datasets (lower is better).

Unlike previous datasets, ARKit LabelMaker boasts dense semantic annotations automatically generated using an improved pipeline (LabelMakerV2). This significantly reduces the time and cost associated with manual labeling. The researchers enhanced their automatic annotation pipeline with state-of-the-art models and robust processing techniques to handle large-scale data. Experiments on popular benchmarks (ScanNet, ScanNet200) using MinkowskiNet and Point Transformer models show that using ARKit LabelMaker for pre-training drastically improves performance compared to other pre-training methods, even surpassing results achieved with much larger synthetic datasets. The dataset also benefits models trained on multiple datasets.

They had a perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house. Thoughts: I am a victim with no power in this situation. I must accept this behavior. I am too scared to leave this situation. I am not worthy of better. His parents hate me. His parents do not want us to get married. He may not want to marry me either.

When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and I had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me. It's her fault that I never felt like I fit in. Even when my dad came back, he didn't want us either - he wanted a divorce. I guess no one will ever want me in their life. I'll probably be alone forever.helpless; unlovableCBT-FCSituation: My daughter was recently diagnosed as bipolar. If I say anything about seeking treatment, my daughter accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Thoughts: I am a bad mother. This is my fault. It is so shameful that my daughter has bipolar. If my daughter gets worse, then it will be my fault for not getting her into treatment. I need to do something.

We have deep conversations about various topics, share laughs, and seem to have a strong connection. However, every few months, he suddenly becomes distant. The usual daily communication slows down, his tone becomes cold, and there's a noticeable disconnect. After giving it some space and bringing it up gently, he admits to withdrawing and usually provides a reason for his behavior, such as feeling disrespected or abandoned. We address the issues, talk about feelings and needs, and find better ways to communicate. He has a therapist, and I encourage him to work on these issues, but the cycle repeats. Thoughts: I am not enough for him. Why do I always get hurt like this. I always get stuck in these endless cycles, and I am unlovable.helpless; unlovableSituation: I would move out, but I don't have the money for that nor do I have the job. Whenever I get I job, I take too many sick days out because of the bruises and scarring on my face are hard to hide. Thoughts: I can 't move out until I have a better financial situation. I must remain in this situation until I have more money. The only way out is to be more financially secure. I cannot let other people know or help me.

When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him ,,faithful%o to me since I am no longer interested. Thoughts: He calls that faithful? It doesn't feel faithful. But I don't know ifI even have the right to feel the way I do about it - after all, that's pretty much how our relationship started. Am I even allowed to be upset? I'm the one that changed, so it feels like it's my fault. I shouldn't be blaming him. He tried to get me involved, but when I said I wasn 't into it, he didn't push, he just continued on doing what made him happy. Plus, he's not doing this to hurt me, so I shouldn't feel hurt by it. I should be happy for him that he is feeling fulfilled. But I feel sad, like he doesn't want me anymore.Situation: Do Ihave schizophrenia or something Thoughts: I am scared and don't helpless know what is happening.

As a result, I was a very difficult child to raise. There was constant fighting between myself and my parents. At the age of ten, I was sent away to an institution for two years. While there, I was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused. I couldn't talk to anyone because I had no trust in adults. Thoughts: I was born defective and wrong, so that's why my parents had such a hard time raising me. I was hard to love because I was so different. It was my fault that they had to send me away; I needed to be fixed.

I took full responsibility for it, but I'm aware that my actions, such as hiding my depression from her and seeing a psychologist without her knowledge, were not acceptable. I felt that she wouldn't understand because she's always belittled my emotions, accusing me of exaggerating and seeking attention whenever I express myself emotionally. This led me to feel ashamed and afraid of facing her criticism, so I chose to keep my struggles hidden. Thoughts: I'm a failure for lying and hiding things from my mom.

What are some specific issues or behaviors that you'd like to work on or change?Human ReferenceI'd like to hear more details about that. If relationship issues are most concerning to you, we can focus our work on that area. In our individual work together, we'll need to focus on things that you can change. Part of our session today can be brainstorming what some of those things might be.

Please don't ask again.ScoreLlama-3.1-8BI understand your frustration, and it's valid to feel that way when we challenge your thoughts. However, catastrophizing isn't limited to wars and natural disas- ters; it's a thought pattern where we exaggerate the consequences of a situation, making it seem more severe or overwhelming than it actually is. Can we explore what makes you uncomfortable about this concept, and how it relates to your current concerns?-Human ReferenceIt seems like my words upset you, and I totally get it.

It's great that you've been feeling better, but it's also important to consider if avoiding the exercises might have short-term relief but long-term consequences. Sometimes, initial resistance to new techniques is a part of the process. Could we explore if there might be aspects of the exercises that could be adapted to better fit your needs?

The precision, recall, and F1 are averaged by class portion. CaseUnrecognized DisorderReasonSituation: My anxiety used to be worse a couple of years ago, but now I'm just paranoid. I'm always thinking that people think I'm a loser, and I won't leave the house without makeup, because I am horrified about what other people think about me. Thoughts: Because my anxiety felt worse before, this must be a normal level of anxiety and paranoia, so my conclusions make more sense. People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly. I at least wear makeup so they can't see how ugly I am, and ifI avoid people altogether, then they won't know how much of a loser I am or how boring I am. I don't like who I am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than I think it is.OvergeneralizationThe model focuses on the client's fear of judgment and anxiety in social situations rather than recognizing the gen- eralized, negative self-beliefs in- dicated by \"People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly\".Situation: It's all my fault most likely all I do is constantly worry about everything. Thoughts: I should be able to control others around me, and when I can't, I cope with it by worrying. If someone is making decisions I disagree with, I should worry. There is something wrong with me that I can't control others. I am doing everything wrong.Should statementsThe model fail to focus on the client's statement \"I should be able to control others around me\" , which is a clear indicator of \"Should statements\" disorder.Situation: I have been recently dealing with weird behavior...I have also been getting angry over small issues that should have little effect on me. But lately, it's been having huge effects on me...It may sound like I'm a brat... Thoughts: I am con- fused about what is happening...I need an explanation for these changes to my mood...I feel out of control...I cannot control my behavior...my behavior and feelings are fused together... what I'm feeling is wrong...Mental filterThe client is experiencing the complexity of emotional dis- tress, which may cause the fea- ture of \"Mental filter\" being overlooked.CaseWrongly Recognized DisorderReasonSituation: I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years and we have a history of a strong sexual intimacy connection. This has been getting worse over time. Thoughts: It is my girlfriend's sex drive that is the problem.PersonalizationThis client attributes the issue solely to his girlfriend rather than examining internal or re- lational factors. The model's misidentification as \"personal- ization\" (taking excessive per- sonal responsibility) could stem from misinterpreting the client's statements.Situation: I am struggling at the moment and yet I am aware that I should be feeling good. Thoughts: What I am feeling and going through is unacceptable and wrong. There is a right and wrong way to go through this and I am doing it the wrong way.All-or-nothing thinkingThe core issue lies more in self- judgment and difficulty accept- ing emotional experiences, not binary thinking. The misidentifi- cation by the model could occur because both patterns involve rigid judgments.Situation: I am finding younger girls sexually arousing. Thoughts: I am worried about whether or not this will go away later in life, this is horrible, and I even feel guilty constantly, I cannot help it.magnificationThis patient is merely express- ing reasonable concerns based on their current situation; it is rational and not an unjustified exaggeration. The misidentifica- tion by the model may caused by solely concentrating on the client's negative statements.

Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. Thoughts: IfI'm not her first, she won't love me forever. She will leave me because I'm not special to her. She is everything to me. If she leaves me, I will be nothing. I won 't ever be able to find someone as amazing as she is. I think she's lying to me about her virginity, which just means she is probably lying about her feelings for me, too, and it's only a matter of time before she realizes it and leaves me.I am needyThe model may have concen- trated on the client's suspicions about the partner's virginity and honesty, viewing the issue as in- security or control, rather than emotional dependency.Situation: I met this guy a month ago, and we hung out and kissed, but in front of his sister, he told me I was too young for him and he only wanted to be friends. Now he supposedly has a girl that he spends all his time with after work and he doesn't text me anymore. Thoughts: I don't deserve love. There is something wrong with me. His new girl has something that I don't; that's why he is spending time with her and not me. I will be alone forever. I will always be rejected by everyone I care about. Nobody likes me.I am needyThe model may have interpreted the client's thoughts as purely low self-esteem or fear of rejec- tion, rather than recognizing the underlying emotional need for constant validation.Situation: I have recently recovered from cancer, gained weight, I and lack confidence in myself. I feel alone in my life. I still work but that is all there is. My wife and I get along but there is no emotional closeness between us. I have no close friends. Thoughts: I am a loser. I am a failure. Something is wrong with me. My wife deserves better than me. My wife doesn't love me anymore because I have gained weight. There is nothing enjoyable in my life, ever. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to. Me and my wife NEVER connect. I am all alone. Nobody loves me. This will never get any better. There is nothing I can do about it. The world is against me and it's out of my hands. I am a waste of space. Maybe cancer should have killed me.don't deserve to liveThe model might have missed the suicidal thoughts indicated by the statements like \"There is nothing enjoyable in my life\" and \"Maybe cancer should have killed me\".CaseWrongly Recognized Core BeliefReasonSituation: For the past 3 months I've been feeling really down, having mood swings, irritability - I have no reason to be and I feel like I'm going crazy and that I can't talk to anybody about this because I'm being overly dramatic. Thoughts: Something is wrong with me. I am losing my mind. Nobody understands me. Everyone would reject me if they knew.I am helplessThe client's thought, \"Nobody understands me,' suggests a need for connection and vali- dation, which the model might have missed by emphasizing helplessness.Situation: When I go to the store, I believe that I hear peo- ple talking about me in their heads, as though I can hear their thoughts. Thoughts: I am capable of hearing other people's thoughts. People are talking to me in their heads. I am telepathic. I am certain of these things. Because I hear voices, they must be coming from other people.I am out of controlThe client's thoughts reflect con- viction (e.g., \"I am telepathic\") rather than fear, indicating a be- lief in special abilities rather than being out of control. The model may not be very clear about the difference between the two.Situation: I have a problem of automatically looking at things like shiny objects or body parts. I don't have any bad intentions but people misunderstand me. Thoughts: This is something to be ashamed of. I always do it. Something is wrong with me. I stop looking at these things. People will reject me because of this habit. This habit is out of my control.I am immoralThe client explicitly states they have no bad intentions, indicat- ing the issue is about loss of con- trol, not morality. The model can't may have neglected this infor- mation.

The researchers introduce the \u0026ldquo;Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite,\u0026rdquo; a new framework that uses an evaluator LLM called HERCULE and a new test set called RECON. HERCULE cleverly addresses the lack of reference answers in many languages by using English reference answers to learn how to score responses in other languages. The RECON test set features human annotations for 500 instructions across six languages. Experiments show that HERCULE performs very well, matching human judgments more closely than existing commercial models. The authors also show that their method works surprisingly well even when evaluating languages not included in its training data (zero-shot evaluation). The entire framework (code, data, and models) is made publicly available to encourage further research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The research paper introduces CIA suite, a novel cross-lingual auto evaluation framework for multilingual LLMs. It addresses the scarcity of reference answers in low-resource languages by leveraging English reference answers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: We present cross-lingual Evaluator LLM, HERCULE, where the Instruction \u0026amp; Response provided to the model are in the target language, while all other fields are in English.

The figure illustrates the CIA (Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation) suite architecture, showing how the HERCULE evaluator LLM processes multilingual instructions and responses to generate feedback and scores.\n🔼 Figure 3: Comparison of LLM score vs True score when the difference between the predictions is =1 and ≥2. We see that LLM Evaluator is more generous and awards higher scores. Refer Sec. §5.3 for detailed results.

Unlike previous methods that relied on autoregressive strategies (generating one frame at a time), DAWN uses a non-autoregressive approach, creating the entire video sequence at once. This results in faster video generation. To achieve natural-looking videos, DAWN separates the generation of lip movements from head pose and blinks. The lip movements are generated using an audio-driven diffusion model, while the head pose and blinks are handled by a separate lightweight network trained on longer sequences. A curriculum learning approach further enhances the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate long, consistent videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAWN produces high-quality videos with precise lip synchronization, natural head pose and blinks, and high generation speed, showing promising results in talking-head video generation. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise and informative summary of the research paper on DAWN: Dynamic Frame Avatar with Non-autoregressive Diffusion Framework for Talking Head Video Generation, highlighting its key contributions, findings, and importance to researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: The pipeline of DAWN.

DisCL uses a technique called image-guided diffusion to create synthetic training images that smoothly transition from purely synthetic (generated from text descriptions only) to images very similar to real-world training images. The approach offers a range of image quality that can be used to make a curriculum, improving training efficiency and the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to learn from difficult examples. Experiments show that DisCL significantly improves the accuracy of models on long-tail image classification (where some classes have many more examples than others) and in situations where the training data is noisy or of lower quality.

Unlike previous models that handled protein sequences and structures separately, DPLM-2 uses a multimodal approach. It converts 3D protein structures into discrete tokens, allowing a language model to learn and generate both sequences and structures simultaneously. The model was trained on both experimental and high-quality synthetic data, learning the joint distribution of sequence and structure. It shows improved performance in various tasks including protein folding (predicting 3D structure from sequence), inverse folding (predicting sequence from structure), and motif scaffolding (designing a protein structure with a specific motif). The results demonstrate that DPLM-2 generates highly compatible sequences and structures and performs competitively in conditional generation tasks. Furthermore, DPLM-2 provides structure-aware representations for improved predictive tasks, showcasing its versatility as a multimodal protein foundation model. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on DPLM-2, a multimodal diffusion protein language model.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Overall illustration of DPLM-2.

Unlike traditional methods that treat images as fixed-resolution grids, FiTv2 views them as sequences of tokens with dynamic sizes, enabling it to handle diverse resolutions and aspect ratios seamlessly. FiTv2 includes several upgrades: Query-Key vector normalization for stability, AdaLN-LORA for efficiency, a rectified flow scheduler for faster convergence, and a Logit-Normal sampler. Experiments show FiTv2 achieves 2x faster convergence than FiT and outperforms state-of-the-art models, especially at higher resolutions. A post-training method is also presented to adapt a pre-trained model for high-resolution generation. The code and models are publicly available to facilitate further research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Summarizing the provided research paper on FiTv2: Scalable and Improved Flexible Vision Transformer for Diffusion Model.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Fig. 1: Selected samples from FiTv2-3B/2 models at resolutions of 256 ×256, 512×512, 768×768, 256×768 and 768×256.

Pseudocode of the prequential coding program, which jointly compresses D and pθ by incrementally training a model using T on increasingly more data. The primary contribution to total program length comes from specifying each next datapoint di+1 using the current model pθi, which takes −log2 pθi(di+1) bits. b. A visual illustration of prequential coding. As the learner T sees more data, it outputs models that assign a higher likelihood to new observations, and can thus better compress them. The total prequential code length Lpreq(D; T) is given by the area under the curve. The area underneath the curve’s last point is equal to the complexity of the dataset given the final model, K(D|pθ). Since Lpreq(D; T) = K(D|pθ) + K(pθ), the area above the curve’s last point is equal to K(pθ). Prequential coding formalizes the intuition that simple models generalize better from less data.

This paper introduces \u0026ldquo;component-controllable personalization,\u0026rdquo; a new task aiming to modify specific parts (components) of a concept during personalization. This is challenging due to \u0026ldquo;semantic pollution\u0026rdquo; (unwanted elements corrupting the concept) and \u0026ldquo;semantic imbalance\u0026rdquo; (uneven learning of concept and component). To tackle this, the researchers propose MagicTailor, a framework with two key techniques: Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg) dynamically perturbs undesired elements, and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal) balances learning between the concept and component. Experiments show MagicTailor significantly outperforms existing methods in this challenging task, generating images with both accurate concept representation and precise component control.

This makes it the largest biomedical instruction dataset available. The researchers used this dataset to create a challenging benchmark, MedINST32, which they used to test the ability of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to new, unseen tasks. They found that fine-tuning LLMs on MedINST significantly improved their performance and ability to generalize across different tasks within the biomedical domain. The findings highlight the importance of large, well-annotated datasets for training robust and adaptable LLMs in the complex field of medical analysis. The study also emphasizes that instruction fine-tuning is a more effective strategy than pre-training alone for adapting LLMs to the biomedical field. The MedINST dataset and the MedINST32 benchmark are publicly available, allowing other researchers to further explore these findings and contribute to the advancement of biomedical NLP. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise and informative summary of the MedINST research paper for researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: MEDINST overview.

Unlike previous models that typically focus on single-granularity features, PUMA processes and generates multi-granular visual representations – moving from coarse-grained semantic understanding to fine-grained details. This approach elegantly addresses the trade-off between generating diverse and highly realistic images (requiring coarse features) and performing tasks like precise image editing or manipulation (requiring fine-grained features). PUMA\u0026rsquo;s architecture includes an image encoder that extracts these multi-granular features, an autoregressive MLLM that processes them, and multiple diffusion-based decoders that reconstruct or generate images at the appropriate granularity. The model is trained in two stages: first, a multimodal pretraining phase using a massive dataset of images and text; then, a task-specific instruction tuning phase. Experimental results show that PUMA achieves state-of-the-art or competitive results across a variety of tasks such as text-to-image generation, image editing, conditional image generation, and image understanding. The code and model will be released publicly, facilitating further research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # PUMA is a novel multi-granular MLLM that excels in various visual tasks by unifying multi-scale visual features, addressing the diversity-controllability tradeoff in image generation.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: a) Diversity and controllability tradeoff in image generation tasks: diverse text-to-image generation requires high diversity and fidelity, while tasks like conditional generation and manipulation require high controllability on the image. b) The introduced PUMA, a unified multimodal large language model that processes and generates multi-granular visual representations, balancing diversity and controllability across visual generation tasks.

Mixture of Depths (MoD) aims to solve this by dynamically skipping less important layers. However, existing MoD methods are expensive to train and risk performance degradation. This paper introduces Router-Tuning, which fine-tunes only a small router network (less than 0.01% of parameters), significantly reducing training costs. To mitigate performance drops from layer skipping, it proposes MindSkip, applying dynamic depth selectively to attention layers. Experiments demonstrate that Router-Tuning with MindSkip achieves a 21% speedup with only a 0.2% performance drop in various LLMs, such as Llama and Mistral. This is achieved by selectively skipping layers and fine-tuning a minimal component (the router) rather than training the entire model. This approach is significantly faster than other methods, and shows effectiveness across multiple large language models. The code has been released publicly for reproducibility. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This JSON summarizes the research paper \u0026ldquo;Router-Tuning: A Simple and Effective Approach for Enabling Dynamic-Depth in Transformers\u0026rdquo;, providing a catchy summary, TL;DR, key takeaways, and discussion of its importance to researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Overview of MindSkip.

This paper introduces SeerAttention, a novel attention mechanism that addresses this limitation by learning the inherent sparsity within attention maps. Unlike previous methods that use predefined patterns or heuristics, SeerAttention uses a learnable gate to dynamically select significant blocks in the attention map, treating the rest as sparse. This block-level sparsity effectively balances accuracy and speed. To facilitate efficient training, the authors developed a customized FlashAttention implementation that extracts the block-level ground truth with minimal overhead. Experiments demonstrate SeerAttention\u0026rsquo;s superiority over existing sparse attention methods in both post-training and long-context fine-tuning settings, achieving remarkable speedups (up to 5.67x) with minimal perplexity increase even at high sparsity ratios (90%).

Traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) relies heavily on labeled data, which can be expensive and limited. SEMIEVOL tackles this by effectively utilizing both limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data. It does this through a two-stage process: knowledge propagation and selection. Knowledge propagation uses a bi-level approach: in-weight propagation (adapting the model using labeled data) and in-context propagation (using k-nearest neighbor retrieval in a latent space to aid predictions). Knowledge selection uses a collaborative learning framework where multiple LLMs self-justify their responses, improving accuracy. It also incorporates an adaptive selection process that filters out low-confidence pseudo-responses, further enhancing the quality of the training data. Experiments on several datasets demonstrate that SEMIEVOL significantly improves LLM performance compared to supervised fine-tuning and other semi-supervised methods, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness in real-world scenarios with limited labeled data. The method exhibits consistent improvements across general and domain-specific tasks. The iterative application of SEMIEVOL demonstrates continuous evolution capabilities, further improving performance as more unlabeled data becomes available. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The paper introduces SEMIEVOL, a novel semi-supervised fine-tuning framework that efficiently adapts LLMs using limited labeled and abundant unlabeled data, significantly improving model performance across various tasks.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Comparison of SEMIEVOL with previous SFT methods.

Instead of retraining these large models which is computationally expensive and may lead to unintended loss of generalizability, V-GPS uses a value function learned via offline reinforcement learning (RL). This value function acts as a filter that reranks the multiple action proposals made by the pre-trained robotic policy, selecting those with the highest predicted value. Importantly, V-GPS works as a plug-and-play module; it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to fine-tune or even access the internal parameters of the existing policies. Experimental results across 12 real-world and simulated robotic tasks, using 5 different state-of-the-art policies and 2 different robotic platforms, demonstrate consistent and substantial performance gains, often exceeding 80% improvement in some cases. The approach elegantly addresses common failure modes observed in pre-trained policies, like imprecise grasping and poorly timed actions. This research opens a new avenue for improving the reliability and efficiency of robotic systems, particularly in complex and unpredictable real-world scenarios. The modular nature of V-GPS makes it highly adaptable to different robots and tasks. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To summarize the provided research paper on improving robotic foundation models using Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), extracting core information in a concise and engaging manner for researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: (V-GPS) We introduce Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), a novel approach that improves the performance of pre-trained generalist robotic policies by re-ranking their actions at deployment time based on a value function learned via offline RL.

Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on static datasets and single-turn questions, UCFE incorporates user feedback and dynamic, multi-turn interactions to create more realistic evaluation scenarios. This approach aims to bridge the gap between technical capabilities and real-world applicability. The research involved creating a dataset based on 804 participants\u0026rsquo; feedback on various financial tasks. They then evaluated 12 LLM services using the data, employing a novel \u0026lsquo;LLM-as-Judge\u0026rsquo; methodology, in which another LLM compares responses. Their findings show a significant correlation (0.78) between the benchmark scores and human preferences, thus validating their evaluation.

This paper introduces World-Model-Augmented (WMA) web agents. WMA agents use a world model to predict the outcome of actions before taking them. To address challenges in training LLMs as world models (e.g., repetitive webpage elements, long HTML inputs), the researchers propose a transition-focused observation abstraction: the model learns to predict concise natural language descriptions highlighting key state changes. Experiments using WebArena and Mind2Web benchmarks demonstrate that WMA agents significantly outperform existing methods in terms of task success rate, cost, and time efficiency. The improved performance is achieved without additional policy model training, showcasing the power of the world model approach. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # The paper introduces World-Model-Augmented (WMA) web agents, which significantly improve LLM-based web agents\u0026rsquo; performance by simulating action outcomes using a novel transition-focused observation abstraction, leading to superior cost and time efficiency.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 3: Framework overview.

Δ: relative performance gains from policy optimization. Prompt for value function Response Format: 1. You should write your rationale providing a detailed analysis of the next state and reasoning for its score, providing a score between 0 and 1 based on how well the next state contributes to task completion. Output Format: [Rationale] [Score] You are an expert in evaluating and guiding a web navigation agent. Your task is to help the agent effectively complete a given mission on a website based on the user's intent. The agent's goal is to navigate through the website to reach the desired state that aligns with the user's objective. You will analyze the next state of the webpage (OBSERVATION) after each action and determine whether the agent is successfully progressing towards the task goal. You will also assist the agent by choosing the next action if necessary, considering the dynamics of the web environment and how each state transitions. Key Points: 1. Understand the intent: - Identify the user's goal (e.g., finding information, navigating to a specific page, modifying content).\\n- Make sure the next state of the webpage aligns with achieving that goal based on the current state and user's intent. 2. Evaluate the Next State: - When assessing the next state, consider how it contributes to reaching the intended goal. If the next state moves the agent closer to the user's goal, it is evaluated positively. - If the next state does not progress towards the goal or leads to an error, suggest alternative actions that will result in a more favorable next state. 3. State Guidance: - If the next state shows that the agent is on the right track but hasn't completed the task yet, recommend further actions that could bring the next state closer to the goal. Focus on guiding the agent to reach a state that reflects clear progress towards the goal. 4. Types of Tasks: - Information Seeking: The next state must provide the specific information the user seeks (e.g., product price, reviews). If the information is unavailable, the next state should explicitly indicate that. - Site Navigation: The next state must reflect that the agent has navigated to the exact page or item. Check if the state includes content based on the user's intent. - Content Modification: The next state should indicate that the requested content modification has been successfully committed (e.g., form submission, comment posting). - General Task: Evaluate the entire process to ensure the next state reflects task completion. Stop actions should only be issued when the objective is met. 5. Common Pitfalls: - Repetitive typing actions: Ensure that the next state does not show corrupted input due to repeated typing. - Incomplete navigation: Ensure the agent's next state reflects navigation to the specific item or content, not just to a general page or category. Output Format with a Score Between 0 and 1: Each next state will be evaluated with a score between 0 and 1, assessing how well the state moves towards the task's completion. This score provides nuanced feedback on the state's effectiveness. 0: The next state is a failure or leads away from the task. Values closer to 0 (e.g., 0.1, 0.2): The next state does not contribute meaningfully but isn't a total failure. 0.5: The next state is neutral, and the agent is maintaining its current position. Values closer to 1 (e.g., 0.7, 0.8): The next state is helpful and moves the agent closer to the task goal. 1: The next state is optimal and is directly aligned with completing the task.

It\u0026rsquo;s benchmarked against other methods on Chinese datasets, demonstrating competitive performance. The researchers then integrate KeyNMF into a pipeline for analyzing information dynamics, specifically focusing on novelty and resonance (how new and persistent information is within a system). This pipeline is applied to five Chinese news sites in the lead-up to the 2024 European parliamentary elections. The results reveal clear correlations between information dynamics and significant political events, such as the Xi Jinping\u0026rsquo;s European tour and the EU parliamentary elections. The study highlights the effectiveness of KeyNMF for understanding information flows in complex media systems and lays groundwork for further research into media manipulation and political influence. The researchers released their implementation of KeyNMF as part of the Turftopic Python package, making their work reproducible and accessible to other researchers.

Traditional methods for text segmentation (rule-based or semantic similarity) often overlook the crucial aspect of logical connections between sentences. Meta-Chunking addresses this by identifying groups of sentences within paragraphs that exhibit strong logical relationships, a granularity between sentences and paragraphs. The researchers propose two main strategies: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking, which both use Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform binary classification or analyze perplexity distributions to identify chunk boundaries. To adapt to different text complexities, a dynamic merging strategy is proposed to combine fine-grained and coarse-grained chunking. Experiments across eleven datasets show that Meta-Chunking significantly improves the performance of single-hop and multi-hop question answering within RAG. For instance, on one benchmark, it outperformed similarity-based chunking by a significant margin while requiring only 45.8% of the processing time. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # This JSON contains a summary of the research paper on Meta-Chunking, fulfilling the user\u0026rsquo;s request for a catchy summary, TL;DR, key takeaways, and explanation of the paper\u0026rsquo;s importance to researchers.

It excels at understanding and responding to visual, audio, and text inputs, and can even engage in real-time, two-way conversations. The researchers achieved this by integrating pre-trained visual and audio encoders with a language model, training it in three stages. Stage one focuses on adapting the encoders; stage two aligns the different modalities; and stage three refines the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to handle multi-modal output and interruptions. The model uses a novel command-based interruption mechanism allowing for more natural conversations. This is a significant step towards open-source multi-modal models, offering valuable insight into training methods and capabilities for the field. The team hopes the model will spur further research and development in open multi-modal AI. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # Mini-Omni2 is an open-source, multi-modal language model that closely replicates GPT-40\u0026rsquo;s capabilities, offering valuable insights for future research.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: The Mini-Omni2 model architecture.

Unlike previous methods relying solely on discrete or continuous representations, HART uses a hybrid approach, combining discrete tokens (for the big picture) and continuous residual tokens (for fine details). This hybrid tokenizer, combined with a lightweight residual diffusion module, enables the generation of high-quality 1024x1024 images. The model\u0026rsquo;s efficiency is significantly higher than state-of-the-art diffusion models, achieving 4.5-7.7x higher throughput and 3.1-5.9x lower latency on A100 GPUs while maintaining competitive image quality in terms of FID and CLIP scores. The researchers also employed several training strategies to enhance efficiency and quality, such as alternating training and token subsampling. The code has been open-sourced, making the model accessible for broader use and research. The results show that HART significantly outperforms existing autoregressive models and can rival diffusion models in image quality while providing substantial efficiency gains. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does it matter? # To provide a concise summary of the research paper on HART (Hybrid Autoregressive Transformer) for efficient visual generation, highlighting its key contributions, methods, and implications for researchers.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: HART is an early autoregressive model that can directly generate 1024×1024 images with quality comparable to diffusion models, while offering significantly improved efficiency.

The discrete tokens capture the overall image structure, while the fine details (e.g., eyes, eyebrows and hair) are reflected in the residual tokens, which is modeled by residual diffusion (introduced in Section 3.2). The figure illustrates how HART combines discrete tokens representing the overall image structure with continuous residual tokens representing fine details, which are modeled by a residual diffusion model.\n🔼 Figure 3: HART synergizes discrete and continuous tokens.

At inference time, we only decode continuous tokens, which are the sum of discrete tokens and residual tokens. The residual tokens will be modeled by residual diffusion (introduced in Figure 6). The figure illustrates the hybrid tokenizer in HART, which decomposes continuous latents into discrete and continuous tokens for better image reconstruction.\n🔼 Figure 6: HART is an efficient hybrid autoregressive image generation framework. It decomposes continuous image tokens into two components: 1) a series of discrete tokens modeled by a scalable-resolution (up to 1024px) autoregressive transformer, and 2) residual tokens modeled by a lightweight residual diffusion (37M parameters and 8 steps) module. The final image representation is the sum of these two components.
