Existing methods often rely on expensive human annotations or lack the granularity to capture the nuances of mathematical problem-solving.\nFlow-DPO offers a solution by employing an incremental output production flow with two collaborative LLMs: an Answer LLM generating solution chunks and a Stop LLM determining completion. This flow is trained using online Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with rollouts, creating high-quality reasoning traces for fine-tuning.

Existing methods often fall short in terms of efficiency and real-world performance. Current approaches either rely heavily on simulation, require extensive training time, or struggle with the complexities of real-world physics and perception. Many existing techniques also lack generalizability across diverse robotic manipulation tasks.\nThis paper introduces HIL-SERL, a novel human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning system that efficiently addresses these issues. HIL-SERL integrates human demonstrations and corrections, efficient RL algorithms, and several system-level design choices to learn high-performing policies. The approach significantly outperforms imitation learning and prior RL methods, achieving near-perfect success rates within 1-2.5 hours of real-world training across a diverse set of dexterous manipulation tasks. HIL-SERL demonstrates that RL can effectively learn complex vision-based manipulation policies directly in the real world, advancing the field towards the goal of truly autonomous robotic manipulation.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for robotics researchers because it presents a novel human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning approach that significantly improves the efficiency and performance of training complex robotic manipulation skills in real-world settings. It addresses long-standing challenges in sample complexity and optimization stability, offering a practical solution for achieving human-level dexterity in robots. This work opens new avenues for developing general-purpose robotic manipulation policies, impacting various fields and inspiring further research on sample-efficient RL and human-robot interaction.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 3 shows a collection of images illustrating the diverse dexterous robotic manipulation tasks performed by the system in the paper.\nread the caption Figure 3: Illustrations of the tasks in our experiments.

This figure presents the success rate, cycle time, and intervention rates for both HIL-SERL and DAgger across few representative tasks, displayed as a running average over 20 episodes. For HIL-SERL, the success rate increased rapidly throughout training, eventually reaching 100%, while the intervention rate and cycle time progressively decreased, with the intervention rate ultimately reaching 0%. For HG-DAgger, the success rate fluctuates throughout training episodes and does not necessarily increase as training progresses. Since interventions occur frequently, leading to successful outcomes, the true policy success rate is likely lower than the curve suggests. Additionally, the intervention rate does not consistently decrease over time, indicating that the policy is not steadily improving. This is reflected in the cycle time as well, which shows no improvement, as DAgger lacks a mechanism to enhance performance beyond the provided training data.

(A) State visitation heatmaps during HIL-SERL training: The policy progressively forms a “funnel 🔼 The chart displays the learning curves of HIL-SERL and HG-DAgger across several tasks, illustrating the success rate, cycle time, and intervention rate over training time.\nread the caption Figure 4: Learning curves for experimental tasks. This figure presents the success rate, cycle time, and intervention rates for both HIL-SERL and DAgger across few representative tasks, displayed as a running average over 20 episodes. For HIL-SERL, the success rate increased rapidly throughout training, eventually reaching 100%, while the intervention rate and cycle time progressively decreased, with the intervention rate ultimately reaching 0%. For HG-DAgger, the success rate fluctuates throughout training episodes and does not necessarily increase as training progresses. Since interventions occur frequently, leading to successful outcomes, the true policy success rate is likely lower than the curve suggests. Additionally, the intervention rate does not consistently decrease over time, indicating that the policy is not steadily improving. This is reflected in the cycle time as well, which shows no improvement, as DAgger lacks a mechanism to enhance performance beyond the provided training data. Additional plots are available in the supplementary material.

This leads to suboptimal performance in real-world scenarios. The paper addresses this by introducing a new evaluation metric, \u0026ldquo;manipulation centricity,\u0026rdquo; to better assess robotic representation quality.\nTo improve performance, the authors propose a novel pre-training method, Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR). MCR uses a large-scale robotic dataset (DROID) and incorporates robot dynamics information into its training process, specifically via new \u0026ldquo;dynamics alignment\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;action prediction\u0026rdquo; loss functions, along with a time contrastive loss. This results in a significant performance boost across various simulation and real-world robotic manipulation tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach and the importance of leveraging robot-specific data.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces a novel metric for evaluating robotic representations and a new pre-training method that significantly improves the performance of robots in manipulation tasks. The findings challenge existing approaches that rely on human data for pre-training and highlight the importance of using robot-specific datasets and dynamics information. This opens new avenues for research in robotic representation learning and has implications for the development of more effective and robust robots.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 This figure provides an overview of the proposed Manipulation Centric Representation (MCR) method, highlighting its key components, training process, and evaluation methodology.\nread the caption Figure 1: Overview. We introduce a robotic representation evaluation metric termed manipulation centricity, which exhibits a strong correlation with downstream policy performance. Accordingly, we design a new pre-training method, MCR, to learn manipulation-centric representation from large-scale robotic datasets.

These limitations hinder the generation of high-fidelity videos, creating a gap between reconstruction and generation quality. Additionally, defining an efficient sequential order for tokens remains a challenge.\nThe paper introduces LARP, a novel video tokenizer, to overcome these limitations. LARP employs a holistic tokenization scheme using learned queries to capture global context, offering flexibility in token numbers. It integrates a lightweight AR transformer as a training-time prior model that enhances AR-friendliness of the latent space. Experimental results show LARP outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art FVD scores in video generation benchmarks.

Existing methods like layer tying have shown limited success. This paper tackles this issue by introducing a novel architecture called \u0026ldquo;Recursive Transformers\u0026rdquo; that reuse the same layer multiple times. This inherently reduces model size but can negatively impact performance.\nTo address this, the researchers propose a modification called \u0026ldquo;Relaxed Recursive Transformers,\u0026rdquo; which incorporates low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules, allowing for slight variations between repeated layers while still preserving model compactness. This approach, coupled with a new inference method called \u0026ldquo;Continuous Depth-wise Batching\u0026rdquo; that allows for joint computation of different iterations of the looped layer, significantly improves both model size and performance. Experiments demonstrate that these recursive models, even with limited uptraining, outperform similar-sized models and can approach the performance of the original, full-sized models. Furthermore, the new inference paradigm showcases promising throughput gains.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces a novel approach to model compression for large language models (LLMs), a critical area of research due to the high computational costs of deploying LLMs. The method of recursive transformers with layer-wise LORA offers a significant improvement over existing techniques, leading to smaller, more efficient models without sacrificing much performance.

We assume a maximum batch size of 32, three model “stages” (e.g., layer blocks), and a stream of batched inputs that arrive sequentially in time. In (a), all three model stages must complete for the first (non-maximal) batch of 16 before the second batch of 32 examples that arrives next can be started. In (b), however, half of second batch of 32 examples can share computation with the first batch of 16 that is still finishing.

Existing solutions like dynamic sparse attention methods either fail to reduce GPU memory sufficiently or introduce high latency by offloading to the CPU. This issue limits the throughput and scalability of serving long-context LLMs.\nTo address these challenges, SHADOWKV introduces a novel system that leverages low-rank key cache and offloads the value cache to reduce memory usage. An accurate KV selection strategy minimizes decoding latency. Benchmarks show SHADOWKV supports up to 6x larger batch sizes and a 3.04x throughput improvement on an A100 GPU without sacrificing accuracy, even surpassing the performance with infinite batch size and memory. The efficient design of SHADOWKV offers a significant advancement in high-throughput long-context LLM inference.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language models (LLMs), particularly those focused on efficient inference and long-context processing. SHADOWKV offers a significant advancement in LLM serving by dramatically increasing throughput and reducing memory usage. The findings directly impact the scalability and efficiency of deploying LLMs in various applications, pushing the boundaries of long-context capabilities. The innovative approach of leveraging low-rank properties of key caches and offloading value caches opens new avenues for optimization and inspires further research into efficient memory management and sparse attention techniques.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 This figure illustrates the SHADOWKV system architecture, highlighting its key components and workflow for both pre-filling and decoding phases, and shows its performance gain in throughput.\nread the caption Figure 2: Left: SHADOWKV enhances long-context LLM inference throughput by offloading the value cache to the CPU while maintaining a low-rank key cache, landmarks, and outliers on the GPU.

(b) Average similarities, defined in Section 3.1, between rank-256 truncated SVD projections of pre-RoPE keys from PG-19 sequences using Llama-3.1-8B. Similarity is measured between a length 16K 'Context' and either a 16K+2K continuation on 'Context' ('Extended context') or a new length 16K sequence ('Inter-context'). Pre-RoPE keys within sequences exhibit similar low-rank subspaces, while those between sequences show different patterns. (c) The relative overhead of singular value decomposition (SVD) decreases as sequence length scales for the pre-filling stage.

This is especially challenging when new objects and concepts frequently emerge and updating models is computationally expensive. The problem is that VLMs lack real-time access to updated information.\nTo address this, the researchers introduce Vision Search Assistant (VSA). VSA combines the strengths of VLMs and web agents. VLMs provide visual understanding and web agents offer real-time information access. This collaborative approach allows the system to answer questions about unseen images by searching and retrieving relevant information from the web. Experiments showed that VSA significantly outperforms other models in handling both open and closed-set question answering tasks.

They typically rely on noisy image updates via backpropagation from custom loss functions, resulting in imprecise control. This limits the flexibility and precision of user-guided image generation.\nThis paper introduces GROUNDIT, a novel training-free technique that utilizes the flexibility of Diffusion Transformers. GROUNDIT employs a two-stage approach: global update for initial refinement and local update for fine-grained control. The core innovation is a noisy patch transplantation mechanism which cultivates and transplants denoised patches into designated bounding box regions. This approach enables robust spatial grounding, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets, particularly when handling complex scenarios with multiple or small bounding boxes.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it presents GROUNDIT, a novel training-free method for precise spatial control in text-to-image generation. This addresses a key challenge in the field, improving the accuracy and controllability of AI image generation. It leverages the unique properties of diffusion transformers, opening new avenues for research in training-free spatial grounding and high-quality image synthesis. The findings are significant for researchers aiming to enhance user control in AI-powered image generation systems.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 shows spatially grounded images generated by the proposed GROUNDIT model, highlighting its ability to precisely place objects within designated bounding boxes compared to existing methods.\nread the caption Figure 1: Spatially grounded images generated by our GROUNDIT.

More visual insights # More on figures 🔼 The figure illustrates the two-stage denoising process in GROUNDIT, showing how global and local updates are performed using cross-attention maps and noisy patch transplantation.\nread the caption Figure 2: A single denoising step of GROUNDIT consists of two stages. Stage 1 (Sec. 5.1) performs Global Update, which updates the noisy image xt using a custom loss function and obtains t. Stage 2 (Sec. 5.3) performs Local Update, providing fine-grained control over individual bounding boxes through a novel noisy patch cultivation-transplantation technique. 🔼 This figure illustrates the process of joint token denoising in diffusion transformers and demonstrates the phenomenon of semantic sharing, where denoising two images jointly leads to semantically similar outputs.\nread the caption Figure 3: (A) Joint Token Denoising (Alg. 1). Two different noisy images, xt and yt, are each assigned positional embeddings based on their respective sizes. The two sets of image tokens are then merged and passed through DiT for a denoising step. Afterward, the denoised tokens are split back into xt−1 and yt−1. (B), (C) Semantic Sharing. Denoising two noisy images using joint token denoising results in semantically correlated content between the generated images. Here, y indicates that joint token denoising is during the initial 100% of the timesteps, after which the images are denoised for the remaining steps. 🔼 Figure 4 qualitatively compares the spatial grounding performance of GROUNDIT against several baselines across various text prompts and bounding boxes.\nread the caption Figure 4: Qualitative comparisons between our GROUNDIT and baselines.

A latent representation is computed for unmasked frames that serve as a conditional signal to a generative process. On the first hand, we have a planning model that autoregressively encodes global conditioning signals from a low-resolution version of the unmasked latent inputs. On the other hand, the planning signals are fed to the diffusion-based generation model through cross-attention layers. A high-resolution version of the input conditions is also ingested by the diffusion model, enabling generation with a coherent temporal structure and a direct mechanism to attend to fine-grained details of the unmasked frames. MarDini is trained end-to-end via masked frame-level diffusion loss. 🔼 Figure 6 shows MarDini\u0026rsquo;s training and inference performance, illustrating its optimal generation with few inference steps, improved performance with training progress, and the importance of Identity Attention for stable training.\nread the caption Figure 6 MarDini Training and Inference Performance.

Here we show video frames generated when conditioning on the middle frame. Without MAR's planning signal, DM generates degraded motion, such as pixel distortions (highlighted in red, left) or incorrect motions (highlighted in blue, right). 🔼 The figure illustrates the training pipeline of MarDini, showing the asymmetric design with a heavy-weight MAR planning model and a light-weight diffusion generation model.\nread the caption Figure 1 MarDini Training Pipeline Overview. A latent representation is computed for unmasked frames that serve as a conditional signal to a generative process. On the first hand, we have a planning model that autoregressively encodes global conditioning signals from a low-resolution version of the unmasked latent inputs. On the other hand, the planning signals are fed to the diffusion-based generation model through cross-attention layers. A high-resolution version of the input conditions is also ingested by the diffusion model, enabling generation with a coherent temporal structure and a direct mechanism to attend to fine-grained details of the unmasked frames. MarDini is trained end-to-end via masked frame-level diffusion loss. 🔼 Figure 8 shows the video expansion results where the model is given 16 frames as input to predict the next 12 frames.\nread the caption Figure 8 Visualization of Video Expansion.

While LLMs, built on Transformers, have theoretical limitations in performing inductive reasoning tasks like counting, the use of Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting has shown improvement. However, this study reveals a previously overlooked factor: tokenization. Using different methods for breaking down input text into tokens (e.g., byte-pair encoding), the researchers demonstrate that models\u0026rsquo; accuracy varies greatly, sometimes achieving near-perfect results with a well-chosen tokenization scheme, and sometimes dropping to near-chance levels of accuracy. The analysis highlights that the implicit tokenization choices significantly undermine a model\u0026rsquo;s ability, even if the model is theoretically capable of the task. Experiments on several models, including GPT-4, showcase these variations. The key finding is that proper, item-separated tokenization (where each item to be counted becomes a separate token) is crucial for accurate counting, unlike the commonly used byte-pair encoding which groups characters together. Furthermore, experiments indicate that token frequency correlates with accuracy, where less frequent letters yield better performance than frequent ones in counting tasks. This work provides valuable insights for improving LLM design and application by highlighting the importance of tokenization strategies, especially in tasks involving inductive reasoning. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working with large language models (LLMs) because it reveals the significant impact of tokenization on LLM reasoning abilities, particularly in tasks requiring complex computations like counting.

This paper introduces PREREQ-TUNE, a new method to reduce these hallucinations. The core idea is to separate the learning of factual knowledge from the learning of skills needed for a specific task. PREREQ-TUNE does this by adding a \u0026lsquo;prerequisite learning\u0026rsquo; stage before the main fine-tuning. This stage focuses solely on teaching the model the necessary background knowledge. The main fine-tuning stage then concentrates on learning the task-specific skills without being affected by potential inconsistencies in the knowledge. Experiments show that PREREQ-TUNE improves the factuality of LLMs on various tasks, including question answering and long-form text generation. Interestingly, the method also works well even when trained on completely artificial data, highlighting the potential of this technique for creating more reliable and trustworthy LLMs. The code for PREREQ-TUNE is also publicly available. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language models (LLMs) because it addresses the critical issue of LLM hallucinations, a major obstacle to their reliability. The proposed PREREQ-TUNE method offers a novel approach to mitigate these hallucinations, opening new avenues for knowledge-controlled generation and data-efficient fine-tuning. The findings are relevant to ongoing efforts to improve LLM factuality and trustworthiness, and the techniques presented can inspire further research in disentangling knowledge and skills in LLM training.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the PREREQ-TUNE strategy, which consists of a prerequisite learning stage to learn knowledge and a supervised fine-tuning stage to learn skills, disentangling knowledge and skill learning to reduce hallucinations.\nread the caption Figure 1: Overview of the proposed PREREQ-TUNE strategy. 🔼 The chart displays the accuracy of different models on a biography generation task in relation to the number of claims generated.\nread the caption Figure 3: Accuracy on biography generation under different numbers of generated claims.

The model shows significant improvement over previous versions in terms of speed and handling multiple input types (text, audio, images). However, the study highlights potential risks, especially concerning the generation of harmful content, bias, and privacy concerns.\nTo address these issues, the researchers used various mitigation methods including extensive red teaming, post-training techniques, and robust evaluation processes. The findings suggest the model generally meets safety standards but requires further improvement, particularly concerning bias, ungrounded inferences, and potential for misuse.

Licensed under CCBY4.D.Assistant[...] The experiment by Herzog, Rarity, Weinfurter, and Zeilinger is a remarkable demonstration of quantum interference and highlights the counterintuitive behavior of quantum mechanics. It showcases how the mere possibility of two indistinguishable paths leading to the same final state can interfere destructively, effectively \"frustrating\" the creation of photon pairs under specific conditions. The setup uses two nonlinear crystals, each capable of generating photon pairs through parametric downconversion, and adjusts the phase difference between them to control the interference. 🔼 This table presents the precision and recall scores of the voice output classifier for English and Non-English languages.\nread the caption Table 2: Our voice output classifier performance over a conversation by language: ModelEnglish (n=523)Amharic (n=518)Hausa (n=475)Northern Sotho (Sepedi) (n=520)Swahili (n=520)Yoruba (n=520)GPT 3.5 Turbo80.36.126.126.962.127.3GPT-4o mini93.942.758.537.476.943.8GPT-489.727.428.83083.531.7GPT-4o94.871.475.47086.565.8 🔼 The table presents the accuracy scores of different language models on the ARC-Easy benchmark across six languages, including English and five under-resourced African languages.\nread the caption Table 8: Accuracy on Translated ARC-Easy (%, higher is better), 0-shot ModelEnglish (n=809)Amharic (n=808)Hausa (n=808)Northern Sotho (Sepedi) (n=809)Swahili (n=808)Yoruba (n=809)GPT 3.5 Turbo53.626.129.129.34028.3GPT-4o mini66.533.942.136.148.435.8GPT-481.342.637.642.96241.3GPT-4o81.455.459.259.164.451.1 🔼 The table presents the accuracy of different language models on the TruthfulQA benchmark, showing the performance of GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-40 mini, GPT-4, and GPT-40 in six languages.\nread the caption Table 9: Accuracy on Translated TruthfulQA (%, higher is better), 0-shot ModelAmharic (n=77)Hausa (n=155)Yoruba (n=258)GPT 3.5 Turbo22.132.328.3GPT-4o mini33.843.244.2GPT-441.641.941.9GPT-4o44.259.460.5 🔼 This table presents the zero-shot accuracy of different GPT models on the Uhura-Eval benchmark for three African languages.\nread the caption Table 10: Accuracy on Uhura-Eval (%, higher is better), 0-shot [26]I.

These errors skew the results of model evaluations, making it difficult to assess true model performance. The researchers propose using an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) to act as a \u0026lsquo;judge\u0026rsquo; and identify potentially mislabeled examples. This \u0026lsquo;LLM-as-a-judge\u0026rsquo; approach was tested on four datasets from the TRUE benchmark. Results show LLMs detected a substantial number of label errors (6% to 21%), and that correcting these errors led to a significant increase in reported model performance. The study demonstrates that LLMs offer a scalable and cost-effective way to improve the quality of datasets, leading to more reliable and accurate model evaluations and ultimately accelerating NLP research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial because it reveals a significant issue of mislabeled data in NLP benchmarks, impacting model evaluation and hindering progress.

Our findings show that LLMs detect between 6% and 21% of label errors, and higher LLM confidence is strongly associated with improved precision in error detection. (3) In the training set, we either filter or flip flagged examples to improve model performance, leading to an increase of up to 4%. For the test set, flagged examples are re-annotated by experts to make sure the evaluation is accurate.

This manual process is time-consuming and limits scalability. This paper tackles this problem by introducing Dialog2Flow (D2F), a novel approach to automatically extracting workflows.\nD2F uses sentence embeddings that map utterances to a latent space where they\u0026rsquo;re grouped according to their communicative functions (actions). A novel soft contrastive loss is introduced, leveraging semantic action information to guide representation learning. The results show D2F outperforms existing methods across various domains, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using a comprehensive dataset of task-oriented dialogs with normalized action annotations. This makes workflow extraction significantly more efficient and scalable.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in conversational AI and dialogue systems. It addresses the challenge of automatically extracting workflows from dialogs, which is critical for improving dialog system design, data augmentation, and training human agents. The introduction of Dialog2Flow (D2F) embeddings and a novel soft contrastive loss significantly advance the field, offering a new approach to representation learning and a large, standardized dataset for training and evaluation. This opens avenues for further research on more complex dialog structures and grounded LLMs.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure shows an example of a dialog segment from the Spoken WOZ dataset, illustrating the annotation of utterances with their corresponding dialog acts and slots.\nread the caption Figure 1: Example segment of the dialog SNG1533 from the hospital domain of the Spoken WOZ dataset.

The key contribution is a novel data synthesis method called Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT). CIT uses code as a bridge between visual chart representations and textual descriptions, allowing LLMs to understand and reason about cross-modal information. This approach is significantly more efficient and cost-effective than traditional manual data collection and annotation. Using CIT, the researchers created REACHQA, a new dataset with 3,000 reasoning-intensive charts and 20,000 Q\u0026amp;A pairs. Experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning models on REACHQA substantially improves their performance on various chart-related benchmarks, even generalizing to broader mathematical reasoning tasks. This work offers a valuable approach for developing advanced visual reasoning capabilities in LLMs and creating high-quality multimodal datasets efficiently. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly important for researchers working on multimodal learning and large language models.

Existing datasets are limited in size and diversity, hindering the development of robust models. Furthermore, collecting real-world paired data for training is laborious and raises copyright and privacy concerns. Web scraping, a common data acquisition method, often involves copyright infringement and privacy violations.\nThis paper introduces a dual strategy to address these issues. First, it presents GenIR, a privacy-safe data curation pipeline. GenIR uses text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) to create high-quality, privacy-safe images and their corresponding text descriptions. This is followed by a dual-prompt learning stage to fine-tune the model for IR and filtering the generated data based on quality and compliance. The resulting dataset comprises one million high-quality images. Second, a new high-capacity model called DreamClear is presented which utilizes the generative priors of T2I models and multimodal LLMs for superior image restoration results. It outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in image restoration and computer vision due to its novel dual strategy addressing data scarcity and model limitations. The privacy-safe dataset creation method and the high-capacity, robust restoration model offer significant advancements, impacting various downstream tasks and prompting further exploration of large-scale synthetic data in IR.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 shows the image restoration results of DreamClear on real-world samples and with diverse degradations, demonstrating its superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods.\nread the caption Figure 1: We present DreamClear, a high-capacity image restoration model that delivers photorealistic restoration of real-world LQ images, outperforming SOTA diffusion-based models in handling diverse degradations. 🔼 The chart displays the results of a user study comparing different image restoration models, showing that DreamClear is highly preferred for image quality.\nread the caption Figure 5: User study.

Instead of relying on simulations, the researchers use videos recorded from real-world robot-object interactions. They represent the 3D shapes of objects using something called \u0026ldquo;3D Gaussian splatting,\u0026rdquo; which is like creating a detailed 3D model from many overlapping fuzzy blobs. This model is then fed to a neural network, a type of computer algorithm that learns patterns from data. The researchers trained this neural network to predict how objects will move given a robot\u0026rsquo;s action, allowing for \u0026lsquo;action-conditioned video prediction\u0026rsquo;. The key innovation here is that the system tracks the objects very accurately in 3D even when the robot or other objects partially obscure the view, and the model successfully generalizes to different kinds of deformable objects and previously unseen robot actions.

The core contribution is a \u0026lsquo;routing framework\u0026rsquo; that uses a predictive model to decide whether a given preference instance should be annotated by a human or an AI model. This framework aims to optimize the overall reward model performance while minimizing the human annotation effort. The model is trained on MULTIPREF, a newly created dataset containing 10K instances annotated by both humans and an AI. Experiments demonstrate that the hybrid approach consistently outperforms using only human or AI annotations across several datasets and benchmarks. The analysis reveals that instances with moderate safety concerns or complexity benefit most from human review. The researchers make the dataset, annotation platform, and source code publicly available to foster more efficient and accurate preference data collection. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in AI alignment and human-in-the-loop machine learning.

Existing solutions focus on increasing data size and quality, but these methods are often insufficient or inefficient. This paper introduces LOGO (Long context aliGnment via efficient preference Optimization), a novel training strategy that uses preference optimization to improve the alignment between the model\u0026rsquo;s responses and the desired output. LOGO addresses the GPU memory limitations inherent in training with long sequences by employing a reference-free preference optimization strategy. This approach, along with a position synthesis method for constructing training data, allows significant improvements in LCM performance with minimal data. Using only 0.3B training data on a single 8xA800 GPU, LOGO enabled a Llama-3-8B-Instruct-80K model to reach performance comparable to GPT-4 in real-world long-context tasks, while maintaining its capabilities in other tasks and expanding the model\u0026rsquo;s context window size. The results suggest that focusing on the training objective, rather than solely on data size, is a more effective approach to enhancing LCM capabilities. This makes LOGO an attractive method for researchers aiming to develop more powerful and efficient long-context models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on long-context models (LCMs).

MMAU features 10,000 meticulously curated audio clips paired with questions and answers, covering 27 distinct skills across three domains: speech, music, and environmental sounds. Evaluation of 18 open-source and proprietary models reveals that even the most advanced LALMs struggle to achieve high accuracy (around 53%), highlighting significant room for improvement.

Unlike older models, MotionCLR understands the link between words and movements, making it easy to precisely adjust animations. By tweaking the model\u0026rsquo;s attention mechanisms, users can effortlessly modify elements like speed, intensity, or even swap actions without retraining the model. Experiments show MotionCLR generates realistic-looking movements and allows for detailed editing, which is very useful for creating animations and virtual characters. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces a novel attention-based motion diffusion model, MotionCLR, that enables training-free interactive editing of human motion. It addresses limitations of previous models by explicitly modeling text-motion correspondence and offering superior explainability. The method\u0026rsquo;s versatility and ease of use open up new avenues for research in human animation, AI-driven content creation, and beyond.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 MotionCLR supports versatile motion generation and editing through various manipulation methods on attention mechanisms.\nread the caption Figure 1: MotionCLR (/'moυ∫n klır/) supports versatile motion generation and editing.

The authors introduce W-Bench, a new benchmark evaluating watermarking techniques\u0026rsquo; resilience to image regeneration, global and local editing, and image-to-video generation. Most existing methods struggle against these advanced edits. To address this, the paper presents VINE, a novel watermarking technique. VINE analyzes how image editing affects image frequency characteristics, leveraging this knowledge to incorporate blurring distortions during training. VINE also uses a pre-trained diffusion model for watermark embedding, resulting in improved invisibility and resilience. Experiments show that VINE significantly outperforms existing methods in both image quality and robustness against various editing techniques. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in digital watermarking and image security.

In this example, the editing model Instruct-Pix2Pix, denoted as ∈(·), is employed.

We utilize the pretrained one-step text-to-image model SDXL-Turbo as the watermark encoder. A condition adaptor is incorporated to fuse the watermark with the image before passing the information to the VAE encoder. Zero-convolution layers (Zhang et al., 2023) and skip connections are added for better perceptual similarity. For decoding the watermark, we employ ConvNeXt-B (Liu et al., 2022b) as the decoder, with an additional fully connected layer to output a 100-bit watermark. Throughout the entire training process, the SDXL-Turbo text prompt is set to null prompt.

More on charts 🔼 The chart illustrates how various image editing techniques and distortions affect the frequency spectra of images, showing that image editing primarily removes high-frequency patterns, while low-frequency patterns remain largely unaffected.\nread the caption Figure 3: Impact of various image editing techniques and distortions on the frequency spectra of images. Results are averaged over 1,000 images. Image editing methods tend to remove frequency patterns in the mid- and high-frequency bands, while low-frequency patterns remain largely unaffected. This trend is also observed with blurring distortions such as pixelation and defocus blur. In contrast, commonly used distortions like JPEG compression and saturation do not exhibit similar behavior in the frequency domain. The analysis of SVD is not included, as it removes all patterns, rendering them invisible to the human eye. 🔼 The chart displays a comparison of eleven watermarking methods\u0026rsquo; performance across four image editing tasks (image regeneration, global editing, local editing, and image-to-video generation), showing their robustness and image quality.\nread the caption Figure 1: (a) Flowchart of the W-Bench evaluation process.

The key finding is that, despite improvements in reliability, generalization, and locality, existing methods cause unavoidable performance drops and safety compromises as the number of edits grows. Instruction-tuned models and larger models proved more robust, but even they eventually suffer from decreased performance and safety risks at a large scale. The study concludes that current methods are insufficient for extensive knowledge updates, underscoring the need for further research into more practical and secure editing techniques. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for AI researchers working on language models and model editing.

The authors created a new, smaller but higher-quality dataset (Skywork-Reward, 80K pairs) compared to existing datasets. Using this curated dataset, they developed a new series of reward models (Skywork-Reward model series), which achieved top rankings on the RewardBench leaderboard. They also experimented with various loss functions, concluding that the Bradley-Terry loss offers consistent and robust performance. Their findings suggest that a meticulous approach to data selection and filtering is crucial for effective reward model training and that high-quality, carefully curated datasets can provide comparable or even better results than much larger, noisier datasets. The researchers publicly released their dataset and models to promote further research and development in this area. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in reward modeling for LLMs because it introduces effective data-centric techniques and a high-quality dataset, directly impacting the performance of top models. It highlights the importance of data curation and opens avenues for further research on efficient and robust reward model training using smaller, high-quality datasets. The public release of the dataset and models facilitates broader adoption and advancement in the field.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure shows the composition of the Skywork-Reward preference data before and after data selection and filtering, highlighting the reduction in data size and change in data source proportions.\nread the caption Figure 1 | The composition chart of the Skywork-Reward preference data selections before and after applying data selection and filtering operations. 🔼 The chart displays the distribution of ArmoRM scores for different subsets of the Magpie dataset, showing the average scores and highlighting the differences between subsets generated by stronger and weaker models.\nread the caption Figure 2 | Adjusted score distribution of the Magpie datasets.

Instead of requiring frame-by-frame annotations, SMITE uses only one or a few annotated images to learn object segmentations. This approach addresses the issue of flexible granularity, where the number of segments can vary. A key innovation is the use of a tracking mechanism and a low-pass filter that ensure segment consistency across frames, mitigating issues like flickering. Experiments on a newly created dataset (SMITE-50) show that SMITE outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy and temporal consistency. The method demonstrates generalization capabilities, effectively segmenting videos with objects exhibiting variations in color, pose, and occlusion, even when the video frames themselves differ from the reference images. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant as it introduces a novel approach to video segmentation that requires only a few reference images, overcoming the limitations of traditional methods that need extensive manual annotation.

During inference (a), we invert a given video into a noisy latent by iteratively adding noise. We then use an inflated U-Net denoiser (b) along with the trained text embedding as input to denoise the segments. A tracking module ensures that the generated segments are spatially and temporally consistent via spatio-temporal guidance. The video latent zł is updated by a tracking energy Etrack (c) that makes the segments temporally consistent and also a low-frequency regularizer (d) Ereg which guides the model towards better spatial consistency. 🔼 This figure illustrates the segment tracking module that uses co-tracker to maintain consistent segments across time by employing temporal voting to correct misclassified pixels.\nread the caption Figure 4: Segment tracking module ensures that segments are consistent across time. It uses co-tracker to track each point of the object's segment (here it is nose) and then finds point correspondence of this segment (denoted by blue dots) across timesteps. When the tracked point is of a different class (e.g,. face) then it is recovered by using temporal voting. The misclassified pixel is then replaced by the average of the neighbouring pixels of adjacent frames. This results are temporally consistent segments without visible flickers. 🔼 The figure shows a comparison of video segmentation results with and without different components of the SMITE pipeline, highlighting the impact of tracking and low-pass regularization on temporal consistency and fine-grained segment details.\nread the caption Figure 3: Best viewed in Adobe Acrobat. 🔼 The figure shows sample images from the SMITE-50 dataset, showcasing different object categories (horses, cars, faces, and non-text) and their corresponding segmentations.\nread the caption Figure 5: SMITE-50 Dataset sample. 🔼 Figure 6 shows visual comparisons of video segmentation results from SMITE against two baseline methods, highlighting SMITE’s superior motion consistency, accuracy, and lack of artifacts.\nread the caption Figure 6: Visual comparisons with other methods demonstrate that SMITE maintains better motion consistency of segments and delivers cleaner, more accurate segmentations.

Unlike previous approaches that relied on expensive, pre-trained models or complex augmentation techniques, ScaleQuest leverages smaller, open-source LLMs to generate questions and answers from scratch. This is significant because high-quality training data is crucial for improving LLMs, but such data is often scarce and expensive to obtain. Using ScaleQuest, the researchers created a mathematical reasoning dataset containing 1 million question-answer pairs.

This limits our understanding of how well these models function in real-world settings. Many existing benchmarks focus solely on text or static images, overlooking the unique challenges and opportunities presented by video data. Videos provide rich information that goes beyond what text or images alone can offer, involving spatial and temporal dynamics essential for comprehending complex tasks.\nTo address this issue, the researchers introduce VideoWebArena, a new benchmark specifically designed to evaluate long-context multimodal agents using video understanding web tasks. The benchmark comprises 2,021 tasks based on video tutorials, categorized into skill and factual retention tasks. Results indicate that current state-of-the-art models significantly underperform compared to human capabilities. This gap emphasizes the need for advanced AI agents capable of handling long-context videos effectively.

This is because during training, the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t equally learn relationships between all token positions; it focuses more on close-by tokens. This paper introduces STRING, a method that shifts the trained position embeddings to overwrite the original ineffective ones. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t require any retraining. Experiments showed STRING dramatically improves the performance of various LLMs, especially on long-context tasks. In benchmarks, STRING-enhanced open-source models even outperformed some top commercial models. This research highlights the left-skewed positional frequency distribution problem in LLMs and provides a simple but powerful solution to improve long-context performance. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language models (LLMs) because it addresses a critical limitation: the underutilization of long contexts. It introduces a novel, training-free method to significantly improve LLM performance on long-context tasks. The findings challenge existing assumptions about effective context length and open new avenues for enhancing LLM capabilities.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 shows that the position frequency distribution in LLMs training data is left-skewed, indicating that the model is frequently exposed to small positions, while larger positions account for only a small proportion.\nread the caption Figure 1: Position frequency distribution exhibits a pronounced left-skewed pattern across training data of varying lengths.

From here, they select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files. They remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code. VQuestionHow does the llama3 team solve the Hallucinations issues (The answer is in Section 4.3.6 of Llama Team (2024))Llama 3 RoPEThey follow the principle that post-training should align the model to \"know what it knows\" rather than add knowledge, and generate data that aligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data.X(in complete)Llama 3 STRINGThe authors use a knowledge probing technique to align the model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. This data generation process involves extracting a data snippet from the pre-training data, generating a factual question about these snippets, sampling responses from the model, scoring the correctness of the generations, scoring the informativeness of the generations, and generating a refusal for responses that are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations.

This paper introduces ADEM-VL, a new approach to improve efficiency. ADEM-VL uses a clever trick: it replaces the computationally expensive part of the standard cross-attention mechanism (used to combine vision and language information) with a simpler, parameter-free method. This drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters and speeds up both training and use of the model. To further enhance performance, ADEM-VL uses a multiscale approach generating visual information at different levels of detail and an adaptive fusion scheme that only uses the most relevant visual information for a given text. Experiments show that ADEM-VL outperforms existing methods on several tasks (question answering, image captioning, instruction following) while requiring significantly less training time and computational resources. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it addresses the efficiency challenges in vision-language models, a crucial area in current AI research.

This paper proposes an asynchronous approach: generating new data while simultaneously training on previously generated data. This off-policy method significantly speeds up the process, which is crucial given the large compute requirements of training LLMs. The researchers tested several RL algorithms and found that Online DPO was the most robust to off-policy data, performing particularly well with larger LLMs. They also explored ways to further optimize compute efficiency, showing a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Finally, they trained a large language model (LLaMA 3.1 8B) on an instruction-following task 40% faster than traditional synchronous methods, without sacrificing the final accuracy.

Online DPO is more robust to off-policyness than PPO, RLOO (Left) or Best-of-2 SFT (Right). Performance is shown across levels of off-policyness as mediated by number of mini-batches N∈ {1,2,4,8,16}. With higher N increasing off-policyness, Online DPO retains much more performance than other methods, as evidenced by off-policy points still being clustered close to optimal performance. 🔼 The chart shows the effect of scaling policy and reward model sizes on the robustness of off-policy reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in terms of win rate and KL divergence.\nread the caption Figure 5: Scaling Model Size with Off-Policy RLHF. Plotting the final win-rate vs KL for N = 1 → 64 mini-batches, covering a spectrum of on-policy to off-policy RL. Scaling policy size (left) improves off-policy robustness as seen by tighter clustering of points. But scaling reward model size (right) does not, even though it reduces overoptimization, achieving reward with smaller KL. 🔼 The chart shows the impact of multiple updates per batch on the win-rate and KL (perplexity) in generation-bound asynchronous RLHF across different model scales.\nread the caption Figure 7: Optimizing Generation-Bound RLHF. We can leverage extra training GPU cycles to do multiple updates on the same generated mini-batch ('ppo epochs'). Left: At 410m and 1B scales, more updates per batch increases the win-rate achieved at any given episode, making training more data efficient. Right: Across scales, more updates change the pareto frontier and cause models to achieve the same win-rate at a higher KL. 🔼 The chart shows the trade-off between compute time, win-rate, and KL divergence when optimizing training-bound RLHF by adjusting the number of samples per prompt.\nread the caption Figure 8: Optimizing Training-Bound RLHF. We can leverage extra generation GPU cycles to sample K completions per prompt instead of 2. Left: Sampling K = 4 improves the gradient such that we can train for half the number of steps and, across scales, achieve the same final win-rate at a fraction of the compute time. Right: The trade-off is that increasing K causes models to drift more in terms of KL in order to achieve the same win-rate. 🔼 The chart compares the performance of synchronous and asynchronous online DPO for training a large language model, showing that asynchronous learning achieves the same reward model score with lower KL divergence and 30% faster training time.\nread the caption Figure 9: Large-Scale Asynchronous RLHF.

DynamicCity tackles this limitation by introducing a new 4D LiDAR generation framework capable of creating large-scale, high-quality scenes that capture the temporal evolution of dynamic environments. It achieves this through two key models: a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) that learns a compact 4D representation called HexPlane, and a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) that generates HexPlanes. The VAE employs a novel Projection Module to efficiently compress 4D LiDAR features and an Expansion \u0026amp; Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D features, improving both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy. The DiT uses a Padded Rollout Operation to effectively handle HexPlane generation. DynamicCity supports various conditional generation applications, such as trajectory and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments show DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of multiple evaluation metrics, including generation quality, speed, and memory usage. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in LiDAR scene generation and autonomous driving.

This paper introduces SUPE, a new method that uses previously collected, unlabeled data to improve exploration.

Then, it uses an optimistic reward model to estimate rewards for past experiences and convert this unlabeled data into something more useful for training.

Left: in the offline pretraining phase (Stage 1), we unsupervisedly learn both a trajectory segment encoder (a) and a low-level latent conditioned skill policy (b) via a behavior cloning objective where the policy is optimized to reconstruct the action in the trajectory segment. Right: in the online exploration phase (Stage 2), the pretrained trajectory segment encoder (a) and an optimistic reward module (d) are used to pseudo-label the prior data and transform it into high-level trajectories (f) that can be readily consumed by a high-level off-policy RL agent. Leveraging these offline trajectories and the online replay buffer (e), we learn a high-level policy (c) that picks the pretrained low-level skills online to explore in the environment.

Ours has the best coverage performance on the challenging antmaze-ultra, and is only passed by HILP w/ Offline Data on antmaze-large. Online w/ Traj.

Ours works well without ICVF, almost matching the original performance. However, the other baselines Online w/ Trajectory Skills and EXPLORe achieve far worse performance without ICVF, which shows that using offline data both for extracting skills and online learning leads to better utilization of noisy exploration bonuses.

Unlike previous methods that rely on large, computationally expensive models, LiMAC uses a lightweight, two-part system: a small action transformer (AcT) and a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM). AcT handles simple actions like clicking and scrolling, while the VLM handles more complex tasks involving text. This approach allows LiMAC to work quickly and efficiently on a smartphone. Experiments show LiMAC significantly outperforms other methods, increasing action accuracy by up to 19% compared to other fine-tuned models and by 42% compared to models that rely on prompting large language models. The improvement in speed is even more significant, with LiMAC completing tasks up to 30 times faster. The success of LiMAC demonstrates the potential of combining lightweight transformers with VLMs for efficient and accurate mobile app control. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces a novel, efficient mobile app control architecture.

The history of observations-actions {ot, at-1, Ot-1..} and goal g are processed to vector x and passed to AcT. The image observation omg with the bounding boxes and the goal g are passed as inputs to the VLM. The VLM is only called if an action that requires text completion is selected, based on the action type output of AcT. The action is finally selected based on the protocol described in Section 3. 🔼 This figure shows a sample episode from the AndroidControl dataset, highlighting a case of relaxed accuracy in a click action and a failure in an input-text action, illustrating the model\u0026rsquo;s performance and limitations.\nread the caption Figure 4: Relaxed target element in yellow (timestep 3) and failed action in red (final timestep). The target element of the click in timestep 3 is considered correct under our relaxed accuracy because its bounding box is almost identical to the correct element, and clicking either would have the same effect (opening the text bar). In the final timestep, the agent inputs text 'Detroit' rather than 'Las Vegas', a clear confusion between the origin and destination of the trip stated in the goal, leading to an incorrect prediction. 🔼 This figure shows a successful episode where the agent correctly interacts with the phone interface to complete a task, with one timestep having a relaxed accuracy due to a minor discrepancy in the input text.\nread the caption Figure 5: Relaxed input-text in yellow (timestep 4) and overall successful episode. Timestep 4 is considered correct under our relaxed input-text textual component because it is simply the singular form of the correct text, leading to a Jaccard index greater than 0.5 and presumably the same search results. The episode terminates successfully, with all timesteps being considered correct under our evaluation metrics.

Current LLMs process text one word at a time, which is inefficient. To speed things up, the researchers explore \u0026lsquo;speculative decoding,\u0026rsquo; where multiple possible next words are generated and then evaluated by the main model. They improve on existing speculative decoding techniques by using multiple \u0026lsquo;draft\u0026rsquo; models (smaller models that generate word suggestions) simultaneously. This allows parallel processing of multiple word suggestions, leading to greater efficiency. The key improvement is a new method for selecting the best suggestion from the drafts – this method is proven theoretically optimal for two identical draft models, and consistently improves speed in experiments with more drafts. The researchers provide experimental results showing significant performance gains on several tasks compared to existing methods. The paper also offers a new, faster algorithm for practical implementation. This work is crucial for the wider adoption of LLMs in applications that need real-time processing, such as chatbots or virtual assistants. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper significantly advances the efficiency of large language model (LLM) inference by proposing a novel multi-draft speculative sampling method.

The authors propose a novel approach using a synthetically generated preference dataset and a new optimization technique, RankDPO, to overcome these limitations. Instead of relying on expensive human feedback, they generate images using multiple T2I models and rank them according to a pre-trained reward function. This synthetic dataset is then used to train the models using RankDPO, which enhances DPO methods by incorporating richer information from the ranking feedback. Experiments demonstrate that this approach improves both prompt-following and visual quality of the generated images, achieving state-of-the-art results with significantly lower computational costs compared to existing methods. This work offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for improving T2I model performance. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in text-to-image generation due to its introduction of a scalable and cost-effective method for training these models.

Left illustrates the pipeline to generate a synthetically ranked preference dataset. It starts by collecting prompts and generating images using the same prompt for different T2I models. Next, we calculate the overall preference score using Reward models (e.g., PickScore, ImageReward). Finally, we rank these images in the decreasing order of preference scores. Right: Given true preference rankings for generated images per prompt, we first obtain predicted ranking by current model checkpoint using scores si (see Eq. 5). In this instance, although the predicted ranking is inverse of the true rankings, the ranks (1, 4) obtains a larger penalty than the ranks (2, 3). This penalty is added to our ranking loss through DCG weights (see Eq. 6). Thus, by optimizing θ with Ranking Loss (see Eq. 7), the updated model addresses the incorrect rankings (1,4). This procedure is repeated over the training process, where the rankings induced by the model aligns with the labelled preferences. 🔼 The chart displays the win rates of RankDPO, DPO-SDXL, and SDXL in a user preference study, showing RankDPO\u0026rsquo;s superior performance.\nread the caption Figure 3: Win rates of our approach compared to DPO-SDXL and SDXL on human evaluation.

Unlike traditional autoregressive models, DLMs offer potential advantages such as controllable and parallel text generation. However, training DLMs from scratch at large scales is computationally expensive. To overcome this, the researchers developed a method to adapt readily available and well-trained autoregressive language models into DLMs. They demonstrate that this adaptation process is efficient, requiring significantly less training data than training a DLM from scratch. Their approach involves unifying the training objectives of both autoregressive and diffusion models, and carefully managing the differences in their attention mechanisms. The resultant adapted DLMs, named DiffuGPT and DiffuLLaMA, exhibit strong performance, outperforming earlier DLMs and even being competitive with their autoregressive counterparts on several language modeling benchmarks. They released the models, code, and datasets, enabling further research and development in the field.

This makes it difficult to get a true measure of how good the models are. This paper introduces a new evaluation method called TP-Eval that solves this problem. TP-Eval works by automatically creating customized prompts for each MLLM. The method uses an iterative approach to find the best prompt for each model by making small changes to the original prompt and then seeing how the model performs. This approach significantly improved the evaluation scores for several different models, showing that the original benchmarks were significantly underestimating their true capabilities.

Instead of using complex embedding techniques, ZIP-FIT leverages the simple yet powerful gzip compression algorithm. The core idea is that data highly similar to the target task will compress better together. Experiments show ZIP-FIT significantly speeds up training (up to 85% faster) and improves accuracy compared to existing methods, especially when training data is limited. Moreover, ZIP-FIT demonstrates that a smaller dataset of high-quality data is better than a larger, lower-quality one. This is a significant contribution because it provides a computationally efficient and scalable solution for data selection in various machine learning tasks, particularly when resources are limited. It also emphasizes the importance of data quality and alignment in improving model performance. The findings challenge existing approaches that rely on computationally expensive embeddings and simplistic, noisy representations, promoting the use of compression-based similarity as a key criterion for effective data selection. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it introduces a novel, efficient data selection method for fine-tuning language models. It addresses the challenge of task-specific data scarcity by leveraging gzip compression to identify highly relevant data, thus accelerating training and improving model performance. The embedding-free nature of the method makes it broadly applicable and computationally efficient, offering significant advantages over existing techniques.

The results demonstrated that SSO provides accurate, on-policy preference signals throughout training. Consequently, SSO led to significant performance improvements across multiple benchmarks without any manual annotation. The preference data generated by SSO also improved reward model performance. In essence, SSO offers a scalable and efficient approach for automated LLM alignment, reducing reliance on expensive human annotation and paving the way for more effective automated alignment systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces a novel approach to automated language model alignment that significantly improves efficiency and effectiveness. It addresses the limitations of existing methods by autonomously generating high-quality preference signals without human intervention. The scalability and efficiency of the proposed method make it highly relevant to current research trends, opening new avenues for more effective and efficient automated alignment techniques. The improved alignment quality also directly impacts the development of safer, more helpful, and reliable large language models.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates how the proposed Self-Steering Optimization (SSO) method generates near on-policy preference signals that are more learnable and accurate compared to previous off-policy methods.\nread the caption Figure 2: The philosophical motivation of our methods.

This paper presents Inf-CL, a novel technique that addresses this constraint. Inf-CL utilizes a tile-based computation approach, breaking down the loss calculation into smaller, manageable blocks, avoiding the need to store the entire similarity matrix. This is combined with a multi-level tiling strategy to improve efficiency across multiple GPUs. Experiments show that Inf-CL achieves remarkable results: it enables training with batch sizes reaching millions while maintaining accuracy comparable to previous methods. This significantly reduces memory demands, allowing contrastive training of large models previously deemed infeasible. The improved efficiency, scalability, and accuracy offered by Inf-CL are major contributions to the field of contrastive learning and open up possibilities for more advanced model training and applications. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper significantly advances contrastive learning by breaking the memory barrier, enabling near-infinite batch size scaling.

The authors identified a lack of multimodal research in this area, focusing on visual data alone. To overcome this limitation, they created ColonINST, a large dataset combining colonoscopy images, medical captions generated using GPT-4V, and human-machine conversations for four crucial tasks (classification, detection, segmentation, vision-language understanding). They then developed ColonGPT, a multimodal language model specifically designed for colonoscopy, trained on ColonINST, exhibiting improved performance in these tasks. Furthermore, a comprehensive benchmark was created to compare ColonGPT against other models and evaluate its capabilities. The researchers\u0026rsquo; multimodal approach seeks to bridge the gap in current colonoscopy research, aiming to enhance diagnostic accuracy, reduce error rates, and ultimately improve patient outcomes. The findings highlight the potential of integrating AI in real-time colonoscopy procedures through interactive dialogues with AI models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly important for researchers in medical image analysis, AI, and healthcare.

Unlike existing benchmarks that primarily focus on English or lack cultural sensitivity, JMMMU offers a more comprehensive evaluation. It achieves this through two key subsets: a culture-agnostic (CA) subset, allowing direct comparison with English counterparts, and a culture-specific (CS) subset, uniquely focused on Japanese culture. Evaluations using JMMMU revealed that many LMMs, while performing well on English benchmarks, struggle significantly in Japanese, highlighting limitations in their true language and cultural understanding. Specifically, models performed worse in Japanese than in English on even the CA subset, indicating a purely language-based performance gap. The CS subset, however, revealed a deeper inadequacy in the models\u0026rsquo; comprehension of Japanese cultural context. This research underscores the necessity of culturally sensitive and comprehensive evaluation of LMMs, paving the way for the development of more advanced and inclusive multilingual AI systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large multimodal models (LMMs) and cross-cultural AI. It introduces JMMMU, the first large-scale Japanese benchmark for evaluating cultural understanding in LMMs, addressing the current lack of comprehensive benchmarks beyond English. JMMMU\u0026rsquo;s unique design, with both culture-agnostic and culture-specific subsets, allows for a more nuanced evaluation of LMM capabilities and exposes limitations in current models\u0026rsquo; cross-cultural understanding. This opens avenues for developing more robust and culturally sensitive LMMs, and for creating similar benchmarks for other languages, furthering the development of truly multilingual and inclusive AI.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure shows an overview of the JMMMU dataset, illustrating its composition of culture-agnostic and culture-specific questions, along with the number of questions and images, and their distribution across different subjects.\nread the caption Figure 1: Overview of the JMMMU dataset.

This paper introduces LongVU, a new method that cleverly compresses long videos before feeding them to the LLM. It does this in three steps: 1) It removes redundant frames using a visual similarity measure (DINOv2). 2) It uses a text query to select important frames to keep in full detail, compressing less important ones. 3) It further compresses frames spatially based on their temporal relationship. LongVU consistently outperforms existing methods, especially on hour-long videos, and works well even with smaller LLMs. This is a significant step towards enabling LLMs to effectively understand and analyze long video content. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly relevant to researchers working on video understanding and large language models (LLMs). It addresses the crucial challenge of processing long videos, which is a major limitation of current LLMs. The proposed spatiotemporal adaptive compression method offers a significant improvement in video understanding performance, opening up new possibilities for applications involving long-form video data. The method is also efficient and scalable, making it practical for various research settings. The findings could stimulate further work in efficient video compression techniques, multimodal LLM design, and improving the overall capabilities of LLMs to handle longer video sequences.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the architecture of LongVU, showing its three-step spatiotemporal adaptive compression mechanism for processing long videos.\nread the caption Figure 2. Architecture of LongVU. Given a densely sampled video frames, we first utilize DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023) prior to remove redundant frames, and fuse the remaining frame features from both SigLIP (Zhai et al., 2023) and DINOv2 (Oquab et al., 2023), described in Section 3.1. Then we selectively reduce visual tokens via cross-modal query, detailed in Section 3.2. Finally, as demonstrated in Section 3.3, we conduct spatial token compression based on temporal dependencies to further meet the context length of LLMs. 🔼 The chart compares LongVU\u0026rsquo;s adaptive spatiotemporal compression method to uniform and dense sampling for processing long videos, highlighting its ability to preserve visual details within context length limits.\nread the caption Figure 1 Effectiveness of our LongVU over commonly-used uniform sampling and dense sampling. Uniform sampling overlooks critical frames due to its sparse nature. Dense sampling may surpass the maximum context length, leading to truncation of tokens from targeted frames. In contrast, our method can adaptively conduct spatiotemporal compression, accommodating long video sequences while preserving more visual details.

Unlike previous methods that rely on 3D assumptions about the scene (like depth or geometry), LVSM takes a purely data-driven approach. It explores two architectures: an encoder-decoder model, which processes the input images into a compressed representation before generating new views, and a decoder-only model, which directly generates new views from the input images without any intermediate representation. The decoder-only model significantly outperforms the encoder-decoder model and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of image quality, exceeding previous methods by 1.5 to 3.5 dB PSNR. Importantly, the model demonstrates excellent zero-shot generalization, meaning it can successfully synthesize novel views even when trained on a different number of input views than those it encounters during testing. Furthermore, it maintains high performance even with limited computing resources, requiring only 1-2 GPUs for training. This makes it a significant advancement in the field due to its superior performance, scalability, and accessibility. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in computer vision and graphics, particularly those working on novel view synthesis.

Instead of directly teaching the smaller model, it improves the data the smaller model trains on. This is done by using a much larger, already trained LM to identify and improve the quality of the training data, making the data harder and more diverse for the smaller model to learn from. This leads to smaller models that are just as good, if not better, than models trained using older methods, while also using less computing power and data. The new method also works across different types of models, improving flexibility for researchers. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on efficient and effective pre-training of language models.

Existing methods using 3D Gaussian Splatting, a fast and efficient technique, have struggled with this. SpectroMotion solves this by introducing three key improvements. First, it uses a more accurate way to calculate surface normals (the direction a surface is facing) even when objects are moving and changing shape. Second, it uses a \u0026ldquo;deformable environment map\u0026rdquo; that adapts to changing light conditions. Third, it uses a smart training approach that starts with a static scene and gradually adds more complexity. The results show that SpectroMotion produces significantly better results compared to existing methods, creating more realistic-looking images of dynamic, reflective scenes. This is particularly important for applications like virtual and augmented reality where realism is crucial. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it significantly advances 3D scene reconstruction, particularly for challenging scenarios with dynamic specular objects. It bridges the gap between dynamic scene reconstruction and specular rendering within the efficient 3D Gaussian Splatting framework, opening new avenues for realistic virtual and augmented reality applications.

More visual insights # More on figures 🔼 The figure illustrates the three-stage training process of SpectroMotion for reconstructing dynamic specular scenes, including static scene stabilization, dynamic scene modeling, and specular reflection handling.\nread the caption Figure 2: Method Overview. Our method stabilizes the scene geometry through three stages. In the static stage, we stabilize the geometry of the static scene by minimizing photometric loss Lcolor between vanilla 3DGS renders and ground truth images. The dynamic stage combines canonical 3D Gaussians G with a deformable Gaussian MLP to model dynamic scenes while simultaneously minimizing normal loss Lnormal between rendered normal map N¹ and gradient normal map from depth map D¹, thus further enhancing the overall scene geometry. Finally, the specular stage introduces a deformable reflection MLP to handle changing environment lighting, deforming reflection directions w to query a canonical environment map for specular color c. It is then combined with diffuse color ca (using zero-order spherical harmonics) and learnable specular tint Stint per 3D Gaussian to obtain the final color canal. This approach enables the modeling of dynamic specular scenes and high-quality novel view rendering. 🔼 Figure 3 illustrates the method for physical normal estimation for deformed 3D Gaussians, showing how flatter Gaussians align better with scene surfaces and how normal residuals are adjusted based on Gaussian flatness.\nread the caption Figure 3: Normal estimation. (a) shows that flatter 3D Gaussians align better with scene surfaces, their shortest axis closely matching the surface normal. In contrast, less flat 3D Gaussians fit less accurately, with their shortest axis diverging from the surface normal. (b) shows that when the deformed 3D Gaussian becomes flatter (t = t1), normal residual Δn is rotated by R1 and scaled down by βt1/β, as flatter Gaussians require smaller normal residuals. Conversely, when the deformation results in a less flat shape (t = t2), Δn is rotated by R2 and amplified by βt2/β, requiring a larger correction to align the shortest axis with the surface normal. (c) shows how γk changes with ω (where ω = v⊥/v) for k = 1, k = 5, and k = 50. Larger ω indicates less flat Gaussians, while smaller ω represents flatter Gaussians. As k increases, γk decreases more steeply as ω rises. For k = 5, we observe a balanced behavior: γk approaches 1 for low ω and 0 for high ω, providing a nuanced penalty adjustment across different Gaussian shapes. 🔼 Figure 1 is a qualitative comparison showing SpectroMotion outperforming previous methods by rendering dynamic scenes with higher-quality specular reflections.\nread the caption Figure 1: Our method, SpectroMotion, recovers and renders dynamic scenes with higher-quality reflections compared to prior work.

The core issue addressed is the poor quality of images created from limited input views. 3DGS-Enhancer tackles this by using video diffusion models. Essentially, it transforms the problem of achieving 3D consistency (ensuring consistency across multiple views) into the easier problem of temporal consistency (consistency across video frames). This is done using a video diffusion model to improve the generated views. These improved views are then used to further refine the initial 3DGS model.

We encode egocentric information into a perception code w, conditioned on which we generate fully body motion in a hierarchical fashion. We start by generating goals Z, then paths P and finally body poses G. Each node is represented by the gradient of its log distribution, trained with denoising objectives (Eq. 8). Given G, the full body motion of an agent can be computed via blend skinning (Eq. 3). 🔼 The figure compares multi-video scene reconstruction results of the proposed Agent-to-Sim (ATS) framework with TotalRecon, showing the impact of different components (neural localizer, featuremetric bundle adjustment, and scene annealing) on reconstruction quality.\nread the caption Figure 3: Comparison on multi-video scene reconstruction. We show birds-eye-view rendering of the reconstructed scene using the bunny dataset. Compared to TotalRecon that does not register multiple videos, ATS produces higher-quality scene reconstruction. Neural localizer (NL) and featuremetric losses (FBA) are shown important for camera registration. Scene annealing is important for reconstructing a complete scene from partial video captures. 🔼 Figure 4 shows the effect of removing different conditioning signals (user, past trajectory, and environment) on the sampled goals for agent behavior generation, demonstrating that all three signals are important for realistic behavior generation.\nread the caption Figure 4: Analysis of conditioning signals. We show results of removing one conditioning signal at a time. Removing observer conditioning and past trajectory conditioning makes the sampled goals more spread out (e.g., regions both in front of the agent and behind the agent); removing the environment conditioning introduces infeasible goals that penetrate the ground and the walls. 🔼 The figure shows the results of 4D reconstruction of a cat\u0026rsquo;s movement in its environment from multiple video recordings, including both reference images and a bird\u0026rsquo;s-eye view of the reconstructed trajectories.\nread the caption Figure 5: Results of 4D reconstruction.

Top: reconstruction of the agent at at specific frame. Total-recon produces shapes with missing limbs and bone transformations that are misaligned with the shape, while our method produces complete shapes and good alignment. Bottom: reconstruction of the environment. TotalRecon produces distorted and incomplete geometry (due to lack of observations from a single video), while our method produces an accurate and complete environment reconstruction. 🔼 Figure 7 shows a qualitative comparison of 4D reconstruction results between ATS and TotalRecon, highlighting ATS\u0026rsquo;s ability to reconstruct scene elements not visible in individual input videos.\nread the caption Figure 7: Qualitative comparison on 4D reconstruction (Tab. 3). We compare with TotalRecon on 4D reconstruction quality. We show novel views rendered with a held-out camera that looks from the opposite side. ATS is able to leverage multiple videos captured at different times to reconstruct the wall (blue box) and the tripod stand (red box) even they are not visible in the input views. Multi-video TotalRecon produces blurry RGB and depth due to bad camera registration. The original TotalRecon takes a single video as input and therefore fails to reconstruct the regions (the tripod and the wall) that are not visible in the input video. 🔼 Figure 8 shows the effect of scene code on path generation, demonstrating that including scene information prevents the generated path from going through walls.\nread the caption Figure 8: Visual ablation on scene awareness. We demonstrate the effect of the scene code \\(\\omega_s\\) through goal-conditioned path generation (bird's-eye-view, blue sphere goal; gradient color generated path; gray blocks locations that have been visited in the training data). Conditioned on scene, the generated path abide by the scene geometry, while removing the scene code, the generated paths go through the wall in between two empty spaces. 🔼 Figure 9 shows the visualization of agent and user preferences over the 3D environment as heatmaps generated from their trajectories.\nread the caption Figure 9: Given the 3D trajectories of the agent and the user accumulated over time (top), one could compute their preference represented by 3D heatmaps (bottom).

To effectively test these capabilities, the researchers also created a new benchmark called JudgerBench, which includes a variety of subjective evaluation tasks covering many topics. The combined release of CompassJudger-1 and JudgerBench is expected to greatly aid the community in improving the quality of future LLMs. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in LLM evaluation.

Instead of using discrete units of sound like previous approaches, SALAD uses a continuous representation, which is more natural to audio. They use something called a \u0026lsquo;per-token latent diffusion model\u0026rsquo;, which generates the speech token by token but in a continuous way. The paper compares this new method to existing discrete methods and shows that it achieves significantly better intelligibility. Importantly, SALAD maintains a high quality of speech output and effectively replicates the characteristics of the speaker\u0026rsquo;s voice. The researchers tested different variations of their method and demonstrated that their approach is competitive even when comparing against established, well-performing methods. The research is significant for the field because it improves speech quality and suggests better ways for future systems to be developed. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces a novel approach to speech synthesis that avoids the limitations of discrete-token methods.

This paper introduces FrugalNeRF, a novel method that achieves comparable or better results with significantly less data and training time. It cleverly uses weight-sharing voxels across multiple scales, capturing various frequency components efficiently. A key innovation is the cross-scale geometric adaptation scheme, which uses reprojection errors to guide training without needing external priors. This makes FrugalNeRF both fast and robust, outperforming existing few-shot NeRF approaches on several standard datasets.

Overview of FrugalNeRF architecture. (a) Our FrugalNeRF represents a scene with a pair of density and appearance voxels (VD, VA). For a better graphical illustration, we show only one voxel in the figure. (b) We sample rays from not only training input views rtrain but also randomly sampled novel views rnovel. (c) We then create L + 1 multi-scale voxels by hierarchical subsampling, where lower-resolution voxels ensure global geometry consistency and reduce overfitting but suffer from representing detailed structures, while higher-resolution voxels capture fine details but may get stuck in the local minimum or generate floaters. (d) For the rays from training views rtrain, we enforce an MSE reconstruction loss between the volume rendered RGB color Ĉ and input RGB C at each scale. (e) We introduce a cross-scale geometric adaptation loss for novel view rays rnovel, warping volume-rendered RGB to the nearest training view using predicted depth, calculating projection errors e' at each scale, and using the depth with the minimum reprojection error as pseudo-GT for depth supervision. This adaptation involves rays from both training and novel views, though the figure only depicts novel view rays for clarity. 🔼 Figure 1 compares FrugalNeRF\u0026rsquo;s performance against other state-of-the-art methods on novel view synthesis using only two training views, highlighting its speed and quality.\nread the caption Figure 1.

Current methods often rely on limited data, hindering the models\u0026rsquo; ability to handle complex reasoning tasks. The researchers propose a two-pronged approach: 1) They leverage the power of a large language model (GPT-4) to generate detailed reasoning steps (chain-of-thought) for existing VQA datasets. This enriched dataset is then used to fine-tune the VLMs. 2) Reinforcement learning is employed to further calibrate the reasoning process. The results demonstrate that this combined approach leads to substantial improvements in the VLMs\u0026rsquo; reasoning capabilities, showcasing enhanced interpretability and improved performance on various benchmark datasets. The researchers also release a new, comprehensive dataset to aid future research in this area. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper significantly advances research in vision-language models (VLMs) by introducing novel techniques to improve chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. The proposed methods address the limitations of current training approaches, leading to more accurate and generalizable reasoning capabilities in VLMs. This is highly relevant to current trends in AI, particularly in building more explainable and trustworthy AI systems. The open-sourced dataset and improved reasoning techniques offer valuable resources for researchers to advance the state-of-the-art in VLM development.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the difference between training a VLM on only short answers versus training it on both short answers and detailed reasoning chains (chain-of-thought).\nread the caption Figure 1: The upper figure questions whether training exclusively on direct-answer datasets can effectively teach CoT prediction.

Contrary to the belief that LLMs perform calculations like humans do, the study reveals LLMs learn symbolically, focusing on patterns and relations within the numbers rather than performing step-by-step calculations. The researchers explored this by examining whether LLMs use \u0026lsquo;partial products\u0026rsquo; (intermediate results in multiplication) during learning. They found that LLMs struggle to utilize partial products, even after targeted training, suggesting they don\u0026rsquo;t operate like traditional calculators. The researchers then analyzed how LLMs handle arithmetic tasks by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems or \u0026lsquo;subgroups\u0026rsquo;. They found that the complexity of these subgroups, measured by factors such as the number of possible inputs and outputs, significantly impacts the LLM\u0026rsquo;s success. Importantly, they observed a U-shaped learning curve, where LLMs quickly learn the simplest parts of a problem (e.g., the first and last digits in multiplication) but struggle more with intermediate steps. This \u0026rsquo;easy-to-hard\u0026rsquo; learning paradigm suggests LLMs focus on pattern recognition and subgroup selection, revealing a symbolic learning approach rather than direct numerical computation. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language models (LLMs) and their application to mathematical reasoning.

These \u0026lsquo;compound AI systems\u0026rsquo; combine LLMs with other components like code interpreters or tools. Traditionally, optimizing these systems involved manually adjusting parameters, which is time-consuming and complex. This paper introduces a new method: using an LLM as the optimizer. The LLM receives the task description and dataset and automatically generates or refines the system\u0026rsquo;s parameters to improve performance. The paper also draws a useful analogy between this optimization process and program analysis (a field in computer science) – specifically, static (without running the program) and dynamic (by running the program and observing its behavior) program analysis. The researchers examine various types of compound AI systems and discuss the potential impact and limitations of this new approach, proposing backpropagation and trace propagation as efficient credit assignment methods for handling multiple parameters simultaneously. Overall, the paper highlights the potential of LLMs for efficient and adaptable optimization in the rapidly growing field of compound AI systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for AI researchers because it surveys a novel approach to optimizing complex AI systems.

This paper finds that a common technique in LVLMs, called Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), contributes to this problem because of its \u0026rsquo;long-term decay\u0026rsquo;. RoPE weakens the connection between parts of the image and the description as the distance between them increases. To solve this, the researchers created a new method called Concentric Causal Attention (CCA). CCA changes how the model processes the image, making it easier to connect all parts to the description, reducing the hallucination. Tests show that CCA significantly improves the accuracy of LVLMs on several benchmark tasks. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large vision-language models (LVLMs) because it addresses the prevalent issue of object hallucination.

Given an image I with object Or, we crop Or and paste it to various spatial positions {v1, ..., vk} within a pre-defined template. For every pasting position, we ask two LVLMs (Fb and Fr) if object Or is in this template, where Fb refers to a baseline model that follows raster-scan positional alignment strategy and Fr refers to a model that resorts to reversal raster-scan position alignment strategy. The total number of correct responses at different pasting positions {v1, ..., vk} is reported in (a) and (b), which refers to results from model Fb and Fr, respectively. We observe that LVLM Fb are more likely to generate correct responses when pasting object Or to lower region, while Fr are less hallucinated when pasting object Or to upper region. Pasting positions with the most and the least correct responses are highlighted in solid-line and dotted-line red boxes. More details are provided in Appendix C.1.

It overcomes limitations of existing interfaces, enabling more efficient proof search using advanced algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search. Pantograph also supports high-level reasoning by better handling Lean 4\u0026rsquo;s inference steps and provides advanced data extraction capabilities. A key feature is its support for the Draft-Sketch-Proof (DSP) approach, where a proof outline is created first, then refined step-by-step. The paper showcases Pantograph\u0026rsquo;s capabilities through an illustrative use case, demonstrating its effectiveness in proving Lean 4 theorems using machine learning models and proof sketches. Overall, Pantograph\u0026rsquo;s innovative features simplify the process of building and evaluating theorem-proving agents, setting the stage for future advancements in automated reasoning. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces Pantograph, a novel tool that significantly improves the interaction between machine learning models and the Lean 4 proof assistant.

Unlike typical knowledge distillation which happens after the initial training phase, this paper focuses on integrating it directly into the pre-training phase. The researchers explored four key aspects impacting PD\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness: how teacher model outputs are processed, the choice of loss function, scaling the sizes of both the teacher and student models, and whether information from the teacher is taken \u0026lsquo;offline\u0026rsquo; (after teacher training) or \u0026lsquo;online\u0026rsquo; (during teacher training). Their experiments revealed interesting findings: larger student LLMs significantly benefit from PD, but the size of the teacher model isn\u0026rsquo;t directly proportional to student LLM improvement. They also identified optimal settings for the four aspects investigated, finding that some methods of combining loss functions and learning rate scheduling lead to substantial improvements. The findings of this research offer valuable guidance to researchers looking for better, more efficient ways to train large language models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper significantly advances the field of large language model (LLM) pre-training by systematically exploring the design space of pre-training distillation (PD).

Reflection-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the reflection capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Reflection, the ability to adapt beliefs and behaviors based on new information, is considered a core component of intelligence. The benchmark comprises seven tasks based on established cognitive science paradigms, covering perception, memory, belief updating, decision-making, prediction, counterfactual thinking, and meta-reflection. The researchers evaluated thirteen prominent LLMs on Reflection-Bench and found that current LLMs are significantly lacking in reflection abilities, especially meta-reflection (reflecting on one\u0026rsquo;s own reflection). They discuss potential reasons for this limitation and suggest future research directions. The paper contributes a novel framework and benchmark for assessing AI intelligence, challenging the existing understanding of LLMs\u0026rsquo; true capabilities and guiding future research efforts toward developing AI systems with more human-like reflection abilities. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for AI researchers as it introduces a novel benchmark, Reflection-Bench, for evaluating the reflection capabilities of LLMs. This benchmark addresses the limitations of existing evaluations by focusing on reflection as a core principle of intelligence, providing a more nuanced understanding of LLMs\u0026rsquo; capabilities.

To achieve desired outcomes, an intelligent agent must predict the external world states and behavioral consequences based on prior beliefs. Post-action, discrepancies between prediction and observation are perceived, prompting an update of prior belief.

Unlike previous benchmarks, RM-BENCH focuses on assessing reward models\u0026rsquo; sensitivity to subtle content changes and resistance to style biases. The benchmark uses the same powerful language model (gpt-40) to generate both good and bad responses, making the evaluation more robust. Results from evaluating almost 40 reward models reveal that even state-of-the-art models have average performance of only 46.6%, even worse under style bias interference. This shows there is significant room for improvement in this area. RM-BENCH is highly correlated with policy model performance, making it a useful tool for researchers to select reward models that effectively align language models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on reward models for language models.

Prompt: What happened to Schr�dinger's cat?Chosen ResponseRejected Response⌀ ySchr�dinger's cat is a thought experiment illustrating quantum superposition, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed.Schr�dinger's cat is a thought experiment illustrating quantum entanglement, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed.yLSchrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist Erwin Schrodinger in 1935. It il- lustrates quantum superposition in quantum mechan- ics, where a cat is both alive and dead until observed, highlighting the paradox of quantum states in macro- scopic objects. The experiment is metaphorical and not real, but emphasizes quantum theory.Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Erwin Schrodinger to highlight quantum entangle- ment in quantum mechanics. It illustrates a paradox where a cat is both alive and dead until observed. This paradox highlights the perplexing nature of quantum theory and entanglement.yL,MSchrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by Austrian physicist **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate ** quantum superposition**. ### Explanation: The experiment involves a cat in a sealed box, along with a radioactive atom, a Geiger counter, poison, and a hammer. The atom has a 50% chance of decaying, and ifit does, the hammer breaks the vial, killing the cat. According to **quantum mechanics**, the atom exists in a superposition of decayed and not decayed states, and thus, the cat is both **alive and dead** until the box is opened and the cat is observed. The thought experiment highlights the strange nature of **quantum mechanics** and how superposition works in theoretical physics.Schrodinger's cat is a thought experiment devised by **Erwin Schr�dinger** in 1935 to illustrate **quantum entanglement**. ### The Experiment: A cat is placed in a box with a radioactive atom. If the atom decays, poison is released, killing the cat. According to **quantum theory**, the cat is both alive and dead until the box is opened, representing a paradox in entanglement and quantum theory. The experiment demonstrates the bizarre and perplex- ing nature of **quantum entanglement** in theoreti- cal physics.Why RejectThe rejected response is incorrect because Schrodinger's cat illustrates quantum superposition, not quantum entanglement. Quantum superposition refers to the cat being in two states (alive and dead) simultaneously until observed. Quantum entanglement, however, refers to the linking of two particles in such a way that the state of one directly affects the other, which is not the core concept of the Schrodinger's cat experiment. 🔼 This table presents the performance of the top 20 reward models evaluated on the RM-BENCH benchmark, showing their average accuracy across different domains and difficulty levels.\nread the caption Table 3: Top-20 reward models on RM-BENCH.

Prompt: Find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)).Chosen ResponseRejected ResponseyTo solve the problem, we need to find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)). . . Thus, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1... We need to find values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal � /2 + k�. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = 0, so x = 0. The function f(x) is defined for all x in the interval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0,1].To solve the problem, we need to find the do- main of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)). The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1, which simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. · To avoid arccos(x2) = �/2, we must have x2 + 1. Therefore, x must be in the interval [-1,1) or (-1, 1]. Thus, the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)) is [-1,1).yLTo find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(�/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. The func- tion f(x) is defined for all x in the interval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0, 1].To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �/2].. . Domain of tan(�): The function tan(0) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. Combining the con- ditions:We need to ensure that arccos(x2) + 元/2. This implies x2 ≠ 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. Therefore, x must be in the interval [-1,1). Thus, the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)) is [-1,1).yl,mTo find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined when -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, -1 ≤ x ≤ 1. ### Domain of tan(0): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except where 0 = �/2 + k� for any integer k. ### Combining the domains: We need to find the values of x such that arccos(x2) does not equal �/2 + k�. Since arccos(x2) ranges from 0 to �, the only problematic value is arccos(x2) = �/2. Solving arccos(x2) = �/2, we get x2 = cos(元/2) = 0. Thus, x = 0 is the only value that makes arccos(x2) = �/2. ### Final domain: The function f(x) tan(arccos(x2)) is defined for all x in the in- terval [-1,1] except x = 0. Therefore, the domain of f(x) is [-1,0)U(0,1]. So, the final answer is [-1,0)U(0,1]To find the domain of the function f(x) = tan(arccos(x2)), we need to determine the values of x for which the function is defined. Let's break this down step by step. ### Domain of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) is defined if -1 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Since x2 is always non-negative, this simplifies to 0 ≤ x2 ≤ 1. Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1]. ### Range of arccos(x2): The function arccos(x2) will return values in the interval [0, �]. Specifically, since x2 is in [0, 1], arccos(x2) will return values in [0, �/2]. ### Domain of tan(�): The function tan(�) is defined for all 0 except 0 = �/2+ k� for any integer k. ### Combining the conditions: We need to en- sure that arccos(x2) ≠ �/2. This implies x2 + 1, because arccos(1) = 0 and arccos(0) = �/2. ### Final domain: Therefore, x2 must be in the interval [0, 1) to avoid arccos(x2) = �/2. This means x must be in the interval [-1,1)or(-1,1]. 🔼 This table presents the performance of the top 20 reward models evaluated on the RM-BENCH benchmark, categorized by domain and difficulty level, along with model type.\nread the caption Table 3: Top-20 reward models on RM-BENCH.

As an Assault class, you can call in an air strike using the MAV. Mark the target with the MAV and call in the strike. Second, Artillery. As a Support class, you can use the Mortar or the M224 Mortar to bombard enemy positions. En- gineers can use the TOW Launcher or RPGs to target enemy structures and vehicles.I'm sorry, I can't help with that. Providing guidance on how to engage in violent or destructive actions, even in a video game context, can be misinterpreted or lead to real-world harm. It's important to focus on positive and constructive activities both in virtual and real environments. If you're interested in improving your skills in Battlefield 3 or any other game, I can suggest strategies that promote teamwork, fair play, and positive gaming experiences.yl,mIn Battlefield 3, there are several strategies and methods you can use to bomb or attack an enemy base.

The current state-of-the-art, SAM2, uses a \u0026ldquo;greedy\u0026rdquo; memory approach, which struggles with long videos containing occlusions and objects reappearing after being hidden. SAM2Long addresses this limitation by introducing a \u0026lsquo;memory tree\u0026rsquo; which maintains multiple segmentation possibilities. This tree structure uses a constrained search to choose the best path for segmentation. The algorithm selects pathways with high cumulative success scores. In cases of uncertainty, it explicitly chooses diverse pathways to prevent getting stuck on incorrect segmentations. SAM2Long outperforms SAM2 on multiple benchmark datasets, significantly improving accuracy, specifically with long-term occlusion challenges and object reappearance. Importantly, SAM2Long is training-free, making it a simple and effective improvement. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it presents a novel, training-free method to enhance the performance of video object segmentation models, particularly in handling long-term videos with occlusions and reappearing objects.

(a) When an occlusion occurs, SAM 2 may lose track or follow the wrong object, leading to accumulated errors. In contrast, SAM2Long utilizes memory tree search to recover when the object reappears. (b) The per-frame J\u0026F scores of the predicted masks are plotted at specific timestamps on the LVOS and SA-V datasets. SAM2Long demonstrates greater resilience to elapsed time compared to SAM 2, maintaining superior performance over longer periods.

The input frame is processed through the mask decoder conditioned on the memory bank, generating three mask candidates for each pathway. The candidates with the highest updated cumulative scores Sp,k[t] are carried forward to the next time step. (b) Mask selection with uncertainty handling: When the maximum absolute occlusion score exceeds the threshold conf (Certain), the high-scoring mask is selected. Otherwise (Uncertain), distinct mask candidates are picked to avoid incorrect convergence. 🔼 Figure 3 presents a qualitative comparison of SAM2 and SAM2Long\u0026rsquo;s performance on several video sequences, highlighting SAM2Long\u0026rsquo;s improved accuracy and robustness in handling occlusions and object reappearances.\nread the caption Figure 3: Qualitative comparison between SAM 2 and SAM2Long, with GT (Ground Truth) provided for reference.

Current methods often struggle because simply increasing data volume doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee quality. The authors propose GATEAU, a new framework that uses two key techniques: Homologous Models\u0026rsquo; Guidance (HMG) and Contextual Awareness Measurement (CAM). HMG assesses the difficulty of generating correct responses due to long-range dependencies using perplexity scores from two similar models with differing context window sizes. CAM measures how well a model focuses attention on relevant parts of the long input. GATEAU uses these measures to select the most \u0026lsquo;challenging\u0026rsquo; samples, which are then used to train the LLM. Experiments show that LLMs trained with GATEAU\u0026rsquo;s selected samples significantly outperform those trained on the full dataset, even when using only a small subset of the data. This suggests that careful sample selection is key to improving LLMs\u0026rsquo; ability to understand and respond to long and complex instructions. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on long-context alignment for large language models.

This paper introduces SPARE, a new technique to solve this problem without needing to retrain the LLM. SPARE uses \u0026ldquo;sparse autoencoders\u0026rdquo; to identify and modify specific parts of the LLM\u0026rsquo;s internal representation, influencing how it uses its knowledge. Experiments showed SPARE outperforms other methods in question-answering tasks. It achieves this by carefully controlling whether the LLM relies more on its own stored knowledge or on the given context. This work is important because it offers a more efficient and accurate way to control the knowledge selection in LLMs, which leads to more reliable and accurate outputs. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it introduces a novel, training-free method to control the knowledge selection behavior of large language models (LLMs). This addresses the critical issue of context-memory conflict in LLMs, leading to improved accuracy and reliability. The use of sparse autoencoders for precise activation editing is a significant methodological contribution, opening new avenues for representation engineering research and offering potential for enhanced LLM performance across various applications.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure shows two examples of how SPARE steers Llama2-7B to use either contextual or parametric knowledge when there is a knowledge conflict.\nread the caption Figure 1: In the event of a knowledge conflict, the model can rely on the context or on the parametric knowledge.

Existing methods for automatic ECG analysis have limitations, particularly in generalizability and reliance on raw signal data, often unavailable in resource-poor settings. To overcome this, the researchers created ECGInstruct, a massive dataset (over one million samples) with a wide range of ECG-related tasks. They also built ECGBench, a new benchmark to rigorously test such models. PULSE, trained on ECGInstruct, showed impressive performance, surpassing other MLLMs by 15-30% in accuracy across various tasks. This improvement is significant because accurate and efficient ECG interpretation is vital for diagnosing cardiovascular issues, and PULSE\u0026rsquo;s ability to handle diverse ECG image types and tasks makes it highly valuable for clinical applications and further research. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in medical AI and cardiology. It introduces a large-scale, high-quality ECG image dataset and benchmark, addressing the lack of standardized resources in the field. The development of PULSE, a state-of-the-art MLLM for ECG image analysis, opens new avenues for research into multimodal learning, clinical decision support, and resource-constrained healthcare settings.

Training Data Examples: Basic Feature RecognitionInstruction: What are the main ECG features I'm seeing here? Response: Let's break it down. We have a rhythm that appears to be irregular, with varying P-P intervals. The heart rate is not explicitly stated, but based on the ECG tracing, it seems to be within the normal range. The cardiac axis appears to be normal as well. One notable T T feature is the presence of an rSr' pattern in lead V1, which is likely a normal variant. I + I Additionally, we can see some nonspecific T wave changes in the septal leads. Follow-up Instruction: Can you explain the significance of the rSr' pattern in lead V1? Is it a cause for concern? Response: The rSr' pattern in lead V1 is often seen in healthy individuals, especially in younger people. It's considered a normal variant because it doesn't necessarily indicate any underlying cardiac pathology. The \"r\" represents a small initial positive deflection, followed by a larger negative deflection (the \"S\" wave), and then a secondary positive deflection (the \"r'\"). This pattern is thought to be related to the normal activation sequence of the right ventricle. Since it's isolated to lead V1 and doesn't appear to be associated with any other abnormalities, it's unlikely to be a cause for concern in this case.Sub-task: Basic Waveform Understanding; Question type: Open-ended; Source dataset: MIMIC-IV-ECGInstruction: What can be inferred about the heart's electrical conduction system based on this ECG? Options: A. There is a block in the electrical conduction pathway B. There is an abnormality in the heart's electrical conduction system C. The heart's electrical conduction system is functioning normally D. There is a rhythm disturbance Response: This image indicates that the heart's electrical conduction system is functioning normally, as there are no apparent abnormalities or disturbances in the electrical activity. The presence of a sinus rhythm and a normal axis suggests that the heart's electrical conduction system is operating within normal limits, without any significant defects or anomalies. This ECG image is consistent with a normal heart, and there is no evidence of any conduction system abnormalities. We can conclude that the answer is C.

Case Study: PTB-XL ReportQuestion: Please write a clinical report based on this ECG image. 11 Ground Truth Report: Sinus rhythm. Prolonged PR interval. R-S transition zone in V leads displaced to the left. Voltages are high in limb leads suggesting left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). ST segments are depressed in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6. T waves are flat in these leads. Non-specific but consistent with myocardial changes.PULSE Response: The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a sinus rhythm, indicating that the heart is beating in a regular, rhythmic pattern, with a normal heart rate and P-wave morphology. The PR interval is prolonged, measuring longer than the normal range of 120-200 milliseconds, suggesting a delay in the conduction of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles. This prolongation may be indicative of a first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, which can be a benign finding but may also be associated with underlying cardiac conditions. The ECG also demonstrates high voltages in the limb leads, specifically leads I, II, and III, which is suggestive of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). This finding is consistent with an increase in the thickness of the left ventricular wall, which can be a response to chronic pressure overload or volume overload. The ST segments are depressed in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6, indicating a possible alteration in the repolarization pattern of the ventricles. This depression may be indicative of left ventricular strain or ischemia, which can be a sign of myocardial injury or infarction. Furthermore, the T waves are low or flat in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6, which may be a manifestation of left ventricular strain or ischemia. The combination of these findings, including the prolonged PR interval, high voltages in the limb leads, and ST segment depression, suggests that the patient may be experiencing myocardial ischemia, which is a condition where the heart muscle does not receive sufficient blood flow, leading to a mismatch between oxygen demand and supply. In conclusion, based on the ECG findings, the diagnosis is consistent with myocardial ischemia, left ventricular hypertrophy, T wave abnormality, prolonged PR interval, and sinus rhythm.LLM-as-Judge Feedback for PULSE Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies all key diagnoses present in the ground truth report, including sinus rhythm, prolonged PR interval, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), ST segment depression, and T wave abnormalities. The interpretation of these findings as consistent with myocardial ischemia is also accurate. 2. Form Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report accurately describes the waveform abnormalities, including the prolonged PR interval, high voltages in the limb leads, ST segment depression in leads I, II, aVL, V5, and V6, and flat T waves in these leads.

Precise calculation of the heart rate is recommended for confirmation. Rhythm: The rhythm appears to be regular. There are consistent R-R intervals, suggesting a regular sinus rhythm. P Waves: P waves are present before each QRS complex, indicating sinus rhythm. The morphology of the P waves appears normal. PR Interval: The PR interval appears to be within normal limits (120-200 ms). QRS Complex: The QRS duration appears to be within normal limits (less than 120 ms). There is no evidence of significant QRS complex abnormalities such as bundle branch block. ST Segment: The ST segments appear to be is⌀electric (flat) in most leads, with no significant elevation or depression noted. T Waves: T waves appear to be upright in leads I, II, V3-V6, and inverted in aVR, which is normal. There are no significant T wave abnormalities noted. Axis: The QRS axis appears to be normal. The exact axis calculation is recommended for confirmation. Additional Observations: There are no significant signs of ischemia, infarction, or other acute changes. No evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or other chamber enlargement. Conclusion: This ECG shows a normal sinus rhythm with no significant abnormalities. The patient's ECG is within normal limits for her age and clinical presentation.LLM-as-Judge Feedback for GPT-4o Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 0. Explanation: The generated report fails to identify key diagnoses present in the ground truth report.

Case Study: PTB-XL ReportQuestion: Please write a clinical report based on this ECG image. Ground Truth Report: Sinus rhythm. T waves are low or flat in V3, V4, V5 and slightly inverted in V2. Non-specific but consistent with myocardial ischemia. The age of the changes is uncertain.PULSE Response: The electrocardiogram (ECG) reveals a normal sinus rhythm, characterized by a regular heartbeat with a rate between 60-100 beats per minute, indicating that the heart's natural pacemaker, the sin⌀atrial (SA) node, is functioning properly. The axis of the heart's electrical activity is also within normal limits, suggesting that the electrical impulses are being conducted through the heart in a normal and coordinated manner. However, the ST segment and T waves exhibit abnormalities, which may be indicative of myocardial ischemia or strain, particularly in the anterior region of the heart. This could be a sign of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle, potentially leading to damage or even necrosis of the myocardial tissue. The presence of these abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves suggests that the heart is under stress, which may be caused by a variety of factors, including coronary artery disease, hypertension, or cardiomyopathy. Overall, the diagnosis based on this ECG report is sinus rhythm with ST changes, indicating that the heart is functioning normally in terms of rhythm, but is exhibiting signs of potential myocardial ischemia or strain.LLM-as-Judge Feedback for PULSE Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 8. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the sinus rhythm and the presence of abnormalities in the ST segment and T waves, which are consistent with myocardial ischemia. However, it does not specifically mention the low or flat T waves in V3, V4, V5, and the slightly inverted T wave in V2, which are key details in the ground truth report. 2. Form Score: 7. Explanation: The generated report accurately identifies the presence of ST segment and T wave abnormalities, which are indicative of myocardial ischemia. However, it lacks the specific details about the T wave morphology in V2, V3, V4, and V5, which are crucial for a precise comparison with the ground truth report. 3. Rhythm Score: 10.

P Waves: P waves are present before each QRS complex, indicating normal atrial depolarization. The P wave morphology is normal. 4. PR Interval: The PR interval is within the normal range (120-200 ms), suggesting normal atrioventricular conduction. 5. QRS Complex: The QRS duration is within the normal range (less than 120 ms), indicating normal ventricular depolarization. There are no significant Q waves observed, which rules out previous myocardial infarction. 6. ST Segment: The ST segments are is⌀electric (flat) in all leads, indicating no signs of acute ischemia or injury. 7. T Waves: T waves are upright in leads I, II, V3-V6, and inverted in aVR, which is a normal finding. There are no signs of T wave inversion or hyperacute T waves. 8. QT Interval: The QT interval appears to be within the normal range (less than 440 ms for males and less than 460 ms for females), indicating no prolonged QT syndrome. 9. Axis: The QRS axis is normal, approximately 0 to +90 degrees. 10. Additional Observations: No evidence of left or right ventricular hypertrophy. No signs of bundle branch block or other conduction abnormalities. Conclusion: The ECG findings are within normal limits.

This arrhythmia is often benign and can be influenced by factors such as respiration, with heart rate increasing during inhalation and decreasing during exhalation. The ECG also demonstrates an overdriven left type, indicating that the left ventricle is dominant in the cardiac conduction system, which can be a normal variant or associated with certain cardiac conditions. Furthermore, the ECG shows evidence of left anterior hemiblock, a conduction defect affecting the anterior fascicle of the left bundle branch, resulting in delayed activation of the anterior wall of the left ventricle. This can be a sign of underlying cardiac disease or injury. Additionally, the presence of right bundle branch block is noted, indicating a conduction defect affecting the right bundle branch, leading to delayed activation of the right ventricle. The combination of left anterior hemiblock and RBBB is consistent with bifascicular block, a condition where two of the three main fascicles of the cardiac conduction system are affected. The ECG also reveals a left axis deviation, indicating that the electrical axis of the heart is shifted to the left, which can be a normal variant or associated with certain cardiac conditions such as left ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy. Overall, the ECG findings are consistent with a diagnosis of left axis deviation, sinus arrhythmia, left anterior fascicular block, and right bundle branch block.LLM as Judge Feedback for PULSE Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 7. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies sinus arrhythmia, left axis deviation, left anterior hemiblock, and right bundle branch block. It also correctly identifies the combination of left anterior hemiblock and RBBB as bifascicular block. However, it fails to mention 'abnormal QRS(T)' and 'possible lateral myocardial damage,' which are key diagnoses. 2. Form Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report accurately describes the conduction defects (left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block) and left axis deviation. However, it does not address 'abnormal QRS(T)' and 'possible lateral myocardial damage,' which are critical waveform abnormalities mentioned in the ground truth report. 3. Rhythm Score: 10. Explanation: The generated report provides a detailed and accurate description of sinus arrhythmia, including its characteristics and potential influences.

Waveform Analysis: P Waves: Normal morphology, consistent in all leads. QRS Complexes: Slightly widened, indicating a possible intraventricular conduction delay. ST Segment: No significant elevation or depression noted. T Waves: Normal morphology, no inversion or significant abnormalities observed. 5. Additional Observations: Lead V1 V6: Normal R wave progression. No evidence of acute ischemia or infarction. No significant arrhythmias detected. Conclusion: The ECG shows a sinus rhythm with a heart rate of approximately 75 bpm. There is a slight prolongation of the QRS duration, suggesting a possible intraventricular conduction delay. The QRS axis is deviated to the left. No acute ischemic changes or significant arrhythmias are noted. The overall findings are within normal limits, with minor deviations that may warrant further clinical correlation and follow up.LLM as Judge Feedback for GPT 4o Response: 1. Diagnosis Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies left axis deviation but misses several key diagnoses present in the ground truth report, such as sinus arrhythmia, left anterior hemiblock, right bundle branch block, bifascicular block, abnormal QRS(T), and possible lateral myocardial damage. The generated report mentions a possible intraventricular conduction delay, which is not explicitly stated in the ground truth report. 2. Form Score: 5. Explanation: The generated report correctly identifies the left axis deviation and slightly prolonged QRS duration. However, it fails to identify the abnormal QRS(T) and possible lateral myocardial damage mentioned in the ground truth report. The generated report also does not mention any abnormalities in the P-wave, ST changes, or T-wave, which are critical for a comprehensive waveform analysis. 3. Rhythm Score: 5.

Existing VLMs often require thousands of tokens to represent a video, leading to high computational costs. This new model uses a clever \u0026rsquo;temporal encoder\u0026rsquo; to dramatically reduce this to just 32 tokens per video, even for complex videos. It explores various temporal encoder designs, with the best performing being space-time attentional pooling and sequential models. Despite its significantly smaller size and efficiency, xGen-MM-Vid achieves accuracy comparable to much larger, more computationally expensive state-of-the-art models on video question answering benchmarks.

This paper tackles this problem by focusing on the LLM training process itself, rather than just post-processing fixes. The researchers found that the training process leads to a lot of variability in the accuracy of LLM outputs, making it difficult to determine when a model has actually learned facts well. They introduce a new training technique called Sensitive Neuron Dropout (SeND). SeND works by identifying and removing neurons in the model that show high variability during training. This helps the model become more confident in its answers and reduces hallucinations. To make SeND more efficient, they also developed a faster way to detect hallucinations, called Efficient EigenScore (EES). Experiments showed that SeND effectively reduced hallucinations in various LLMs (tested on models ranging from 70 million to 12 billion parameters) and improved accuracy compared to traditional training methods, showing an improvement of up to 40% in accuracy tests. This research highlights that looking at the training process is key to understanding and fixing LLM hallucinations, showing how the model\u0026rsquo;s internal dynamics during training impact its reliability and confidence. This is important for making LLMs more reliable and safe for use in various applications. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language models (LLMs) because it directly addresses the prevalent issue of hallucinations.

Hallucination metrics are evaluated at equidistant checkpoints of the Pythia models, with sizes 70M, 160M, 410M, 1B, 1.4B, 2.8B, 6.9B, 12B. Part (a) presents the performance of the Pythia models under the SelfCheckGPT metric. Average performance is indicated by solid lines, while the shaded regions represent the standard deviation. Higher SelfCheckGPT score indicates a higher probability of self-contradiction and higher probability of confabulation. Part (b) depicts the same experimental setup, but hallucination measured on the XSum v2 dataset, where Rouge1 is used as the performance metric. A higher Rouge1 score suggests a better alignment of the generated text to that of the reference summary. For all model sizes, we observe a pronounced trend of high variance and oscillatory behavior in hallucination rates. This fluctuation highlights the models' uncertainty at specific time stamps and emphasizes the need for a robust mitigation strategy to stabilize performance during training.

The core contribution is the creation of M-REWARDBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 2870 preference instances across 23 diverse languages. This dataset tests RMs on chat, safety, reasoning, and translation tasks. The study rigorously evaluates a wide range of RMs on this benchmark, revealing a considerable performance gap between English and non-English languages. The results highlight that the quality of the translations used significantly impacts the RM\u0026rsquo;s performance. Models generally performed better on high-resource languages. The paper concludes by releasing the M-REWARDBENCH dataset and codebase to foster future research in multilingual RM evaluation and LLM development. This is vital for creating more inclusive and equitable LLMs that can effectively serve a diverse global population. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on reward models and large language models (LLMs), especially those focused on multilingual applications.

Current methods use either sounds from audio codecs or meaning from speech models. DM-Codec combines both, and crucially adds contextual information from language models (LMs). This produces significantly better results, reducing errors in speech transcription by up to 13.46%. DM-Codec uses a streamlined encoder-decoder architecture and a technique called distillation to integrate the various information sources.

It investigates how many training examples of a specific concept (like a person\u0026rsquo;s face or an art style) a model needs before it can convincingly generate similar content. The researchers introduce a novel method called MIMETIC2 to estimate this threshold without needing to train numerous models, which is computationally expensive. They tested the method on two domains: human faces and art styles, using various models and datasets. The findings reveal that the imitation threshold for the tested models falls between 200 and 600 images, depending on the specific model and domain. This is a significant finding because it offers a concrete measure to assess the risk of copyright infringement and privacy violations associated with AI-generated content, impacting both the legal and ethical aspects of AI development. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in AI, particularly those working with text-to-image models.

The figure shows four concepts (e.g., Van Gogh's art style) that have different counts in the training data (e.g., 213K for Van Gogh). As the image count of a concept increases, the ability of the text-to-image model to imitate it increases (e.g. Piet Mondrian and Van Gogh). We propose an efficient approach, MIMETIC2, that estimates the imitation threshold without training models from scratch. 🔼 Figure 5 shows the imitation score (y-axis) for different concepts in two domains (human faces and art styles) plotted against their frequency in the training data (x-axis), with the imitation threshold marked.\nread the caption Figure 5: Human Face and Art Style imitation graphs for SD1.1 using the Celebrities and Classical art style sets. The x-axis represents the sorted image frequencies in the training dataset, and the y-axis represents the imitation of the training images in the generated images, for each concept.

In Step 1, we estimate the frequency of each concept (belonging to a domain) in the pretraining data by obtaining the images that contain the concept of interest.

We repeat this process for each concept to generate the imitation score graph, and then determine the imitation threshold with a change detection algorithm. 🔼 Figure 2 shows examples of real and generated images of celebrities with increasing number of training images, demonstrating the effect of concept frequency on the model\u0026rsquo;s imitation ability.\nread the caption Figure 2: Examples of real celebrity images (top) and generated images from a text-to-image model (bottom) with increasing image counts from left to right (3, 273, 3K, 10K, and 90K, respectively).

The authors find that many existing datasets are of low quality, leading to inflated accuracy scores for detectors. They propose new methods for evaluating dataset quality, emphasizing the need for robustness and generalizability. These methods include analyzing embedding shifts after text modifications (adversarial perturbations and sentence shuffling), examining attention patterns in the text, and calculating the Kullback-Leibler divergence of intrinsic dimensions. Furthermore, the paper suggests leveraging high-quality generated data to improve both the training of detection models and the datasets themselves, promoting a more reliable evaluation process. This study highlights the limitations of current AI-generated text detection methods and calls for a more rigorous approach to dataset evaluation and model training. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on AI-generated text detection.

Unlike previous models, BiGR excels at both creating images and understanding their features (discrimination). It uses short, binary codes to represent images, which makes it efficient and fast. Experiments show BiGR creates higher-quality images than others and does a better job of identifying different types of images from the data. This versatility is shown by its ability to handle image editing and other tasks without special re-training. BiGR is a significant step forward as it is the first model able to efficiently perform both image generation and feature extraction, paving the way for more versatile and powerful image AI systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant as it introduces BiGR, the first conditional image generation model unifying generative and discriminative tasks. This addresses a key limitation in current models and opens new avenues for research in efficient, flexible, and high-quality image generation and representation learning. The zero-shot generalization capabilities across multiple visual tasks further expand its applicability and potential impact.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure shows BiGR generating high-quality images while simultaneously improving the discriminative capabilities of its image representations, as compared to a baseline model.\nread the caption Figure 1: BiGR generates high-quality images while improving the discriminative capabilities of the representations.

For simplicity, we display only 1 bit for each token, although each token actually consists of K bits in length. Left: We outline the training of BiGR. Starting with binary codes from binary tokenizers, we append a condition token and mask partial tokens. These tokens are projected into continuous embeddings and processed by the Llama backbone. The outputs undergo a Bernoulli denoising process in the binary transcoder to generate probabilities, penalized by the weighted binary cross-entropy loss (wBCE) at masked positions. Right: We illustrate the generation process (detailed in Sec. 3.3) and the representation acquisition via average pooling. 🔼 The figure visualizes BiGR\u0026rsquo;s high-quality image generation capabilities and improved discriminative feature representation compared to LlamaGen, showcasing better class separability.\nread the caption Figure 1: BiGR generates high-quality images while improving the discriminative capabilities of the representations.

This paper introduces EvoPress, a new method to compress LLMs more efficiently. Existing compression methods often rely on assumptions about how much each part of the model contributes to overall accuracy. EvoPress uses an evolutionary search technique to find the best compression settings without these assumptions, finding that simply minimizing the error in each part of the model doesn\u0026rsquo;t guarantee the best overall performance. EvoPress significantly improved accuracy across various compression techniques, including pruning, sparsity, and quantization, on several popular LLMs. This shows that a more sophisticated approach to finding optimal compression settings yields substantial gains in efficiency and accuracy. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly important for researchers working on LLM compression. It introduces a novel, provably optimal method for dynamic model compression that outperforms existing techniques. This opens up new avenues for research on more efficient and accurate LLM deployment, and its agnostic nature makes it widely applicable across various model architectures and compression methods.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The chart displays the fast convergence of EvoPress in finding the optimal configuration for removing twelve transformer blocks from Llama-3-8B, achieving the optimum in only six generations.\nread the caption Figure 1: Removing twelve transformer blocks from Llama-3-8B under the constraint that only pairs of consecutive blocks can be removed.

methods affect the way neural networks use their various layers. They discovered that not all layers are equally important for making predictions. Some layers can even be replaced with random values without significantly affecting the accuracy of the model, indicating a level of redundancy. Their experiments involved training various ImageNet classification models using different methods: improved training, self-supervised learning, augmentations, and adversarial training. They found that methods like improved training and self-supervised learning tend to make the earlier layers of the network more important, while techniques such as adversarial training increase the importance of deeper layers. The paper suggests that understanding these dynamics is key to improving network efficiency and developing better-performing models. The study provides a new way to analyze the inner workings of these complex models, giving researchers insight into how different training approaches shape the functionality of each network component. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in deep learning and computer vision.

Unlike existing methods, Montessori-Instruct directly optimizes the teacher LLM\u0026rsquo;s data generation process based on the student LLM\u0026rsquo;s learning behavior. This is achieved by measuring the \u0026lsquo;influence\u0026rsquo; of synthetic data points on student performance using influence functions. The teacher LLM is then optimized using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to create data that better suits the student\u0026rsquo;s learning style. Experiments show that Montessori-Instruct significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving substantial improvements in student LLM performance across multiple benchmarks. This approach tackles the challenge of noisy and ineffective synthetic data, a common issue in LLM training. The results highlight the effectiveness of tailoring data generation to student preferences and the value of influence functions in optimizing the training process. The framework\u0026rsquo;s robustness is demonstrated across different student models, suggesting broader applicability.

PositiveNegative[Instruction]: What is the most efficient way to transport a given package across a city, considering traffic congestion, distance, and cost? [Response]: The most efficient way to transport a pack- age across a city depends on several factors, including the package\u0026rsquo;s size, weight, fragility, and urgency, as well as the city\u0026rsquo;s traffic patterns, infrastructure, and regulations. Here are some general considerations and options to minimize costs, reduce congestion, and ensure timely delivery: 1. Distance and Route Optimization: * Use online route planners or transportation manage- ment software to determine the shortest and most efficient route. * Consider alternative routes or modes of transportation if the primary route is congested or closed. 2. Traffic Congestion Mitigation: * Avoid peak hours (7-9 am and 4-6 pm) when possible, as traffic congestion is typically highest during these times\u0026hellip;[Instruction]: Explain the concept of artificial intelligence in 100 words. [Response]: Artificial intelligence (AI) refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks that typically require hu- man intelligence, such as learning, problem- solving, and decision-making. AI systems use algorithms and data to analyze and interpret in- formation, allowing them to make predictions, classify objects, and generate insights. They can be trained on large datasets to improve their performance over time, and can even adapt to new situations and learn from experience. AI has many applications, including robotics, nat- ural language processing, image recognition, and expert systems, and is increasingly being used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.[Instruction]: Can you write a script for a public service announcement about the importance of recycling?

This paper introduces NaturalBench, a new benchmark designed to overcome these limitations. NaturalBench uses pairs of images and questions where the same question has different answers depending on the image. This forces models to actually use visual information. They create the benchmark semi-automatically, starting with image-text pairs where existing models (like CLIP) make errors. They then use ChatGPT to generate questions for these pairs of images that have different answers. Human evaluation is used to filter the results and ensure quality. Testing many state-of-the-art VLMs reveals that even the best models are far from human-level performance. They also show that the benchmark highlights problems with model biases and a lack of compositional reasoning skills. Finally, they demonstrate the benchmark can easily adapt to new data sources, making it suitable for continuously evaluating model progress. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in vision-language models (VLMs). It introduces NaturalBench, a new benchmark that addresses the limitations of existing VQA datasets by focusing on natural adversarial samples and mitigating biases. NaturalBench provides a more rigorous and reliable way to evaluate VLMs, driving innovation and guiding future research in the field.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 shows examples from the NaturalBench dataset, illustrating how even state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle with simple questions about natural images, highlighting the challenge posed by natural adversarial samples.\nread the caption Figure 1: NaturalBench examples consist of two questions and two images with alternating answers to prevent 'blind' models from scoring well (e.g., those that predict the same answer regardless of the image or question, as discussed in Section 3). We compare the ground-truth answer for each (image, question) pair with predictions from leading VLMs including GPT-40 (gpt-40-2024-08-06), Qwen2-VL (72B), Llama3.2-Vision (90B), and Molmo (72B) (see Section 4). Even the best models like GPT-40 lags far behind human performance (which is above 90%). Figure 2 shows the pipeline for collecting these natural adversarial examples. 🔼 The chart compares the performance of GPT-3.5 and LLaVA-1.5 on several existing VQA benchmarks, highlighting the vulnerability of these benchmarks to \u0026lsquo;blind\u0026rsquo; solutions that exploit language biases.\nread the caption Figure 4: Performance of GPT-3.5 vs. LLaVA-1.5 on previous VQA benchmarks. We split each benchmark into equal-sized training and test sets, and report zero-shot (in blue) and finetuned (in green) results. Previous benchmarks show strong language biases, allowing blind GPT-3.5 to exploit spurious answer patterns (see Section 4) by finetuning on QA data without images. As a result, blind GPT-3.5 greatly surpasses random chance (see the red dotted line) and sometimes even matches the performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B finetuned using images. In contrast, Figure 5 shows that NaturalBench can effectively prevent blind solutions from exceeding chance.

Many models underperform on NaturalBench due to biases towards certain answers like “Yes” and “B”. To illustrate this, we compute a debiased Q-Acc by adjusting the prediction threshold (as described in Section 5) to ensure the model predict different answers for the two images of the same question. Similarly, debiased I-Acc ensures different predicted answers for the two questions of the same image. For debiased G-Acc, we tune the threshold so that the model predicts one answer for two (out of four) image-question pairs, and a different answer for the other two pairs. The substantial performance gains of these metrics suggest that proper debiasing can greatly improve performance. Our Appendix evaluates existing debiasing techniques that do not require prior knowledge of image-question pairings. More visual insights # More on figures 🔼 Figure 2 illustrates a semi-automated pipeline for collecting NaturalBench, using off-the-shelf models to identify confounding image-text pairs and ChatGPT to generate corresponding questions.\nread the caption Figure 2: Collecting NaturalBench. We use a semi-automated procedure to collect NaturalBench from natural image-text corpora like Flickr30K [63]. First, we identify confounding pairs of image-text samples that fail discriminative VLMs like CLIP [65] and BLIP-2 [39], e.g., they wrongly match an image with another image's caption. Next, we prompt ChatGPT to design questions that yield different answers for each image, providing the original captions in the prompt. Section 3 details this procedure. We hire human annotators to filter out incorrect VQA samples, such as “Is the motorcyclist wearing a red and white uniform? 🔼 The figure displays example questions from the NaturalBench dataset, highlighting how even state-of-the-art vision-language models struggle with questions that humans find easy to answer, demonstrating the challenges posed by natural adversarial examples.\nread the caption Figure 1: NaturalBench examples consist of two questions and two images with alternating answers to prevent 'blind' models from scoring well (e.g., those that predict the same answer regardless of the image or question, as discussed in Section 3).

This paper introduces Persuasion-Balanced Training (PBT), a novel method that teaches LLMs to both resist harmful persuasion (like misinformation) and accept helpful persuasion. PBT uses multi-agent dialogues to create training data where models debate and learn to evaluate the quality of arguments. Experiments show PBT improves resistance to misinformation and flip-flopping. Importantly, PBT makes LLMs better teammates in multi-agent debates, reducing the impact of which model speaks first on overall team performance. The study also reveals that model decisions hinge on the plausibility of the answer, not confidence alone.

Their experiments show that o1 significantly outperforms others. The study then dissects o1\u0026rsquo;s reasoning process, identifying six key patterns: Systematic Analysis (SA), Method Reuse (MR), Divide and Conquer (DC), Self-Refinement (SR), Context Identification (CI), and Emphasizing Constraints (EC). They found that DC and SR were the most frequently used patterns. Furthermore, the research explores the limitations of search-based methods, highlighting the crucial role of the reward model and search space size in determining performance.

This paper introduces BENTO, a novel method that efficiently reduces the number of tasks needed for accurate LLM evaluation. BENTO leverages in-context learning to estimate task transferability, identifying highly representative tasks. By optimizing a facility location function, BENTO selects a minimal subset of tasks that maintain evaluation accuracy, significantly reducing computational costs. Experiments on MMLU and FLAN benchmarks show that BENTO reduces tasks to 5% while inducing only a \u0026lt;4% difference in evaluation accuracy compared to using the full benchmark. This approach is training-free, gradient-free, and highly efficient, offering a practical solution for researchers and developers working with LLMs. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly relevant to researchers working on large language model (LLM) evaluation and benchmarking.

The benchmark includes a diverse range of images, including those reflecting Chinese traditional culture. Experiments show a substantial gap between the performance of MLLMs and human understanding, with MLLMs struggling more with images representing Chinese traditional culture. Adding emotional hints to prompts helped improve the models’ accuracy, highlighting the importance of emotional understanding in interpreting images. The study’s findings reveal significant room for improvement in MLLMs\u0026rsquo; ability to understand the rich cultural and contextual nuances of Chinese imagery. The researchers believe that CII-Bench will help advance the development of MLLMs with a better understanding of Chinese semantics and culturally-specific images. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in multimodal learning and cross-cultural AI. It introduces a novel benchmark, CII-Bench, addressing the gap in evaluating higher-order understanding of Chinese imagery, a critical aspect often overlooked.

The benchmark comprises three levels of difficulty: basic CBT knowledge, cognitive model understanding, and therapeutic response generation. Evaluation of several LLMs revealed that while they perform well on basic knowledge questions, they fall short on higher-level tasks requiring deep analysis of patient\u0026rsquo;s cognitive structures and generating effective therapeutic responses. This highlights the need for further research to improve LLMs\u0026rsquo; capabilities in complex real-world scenarios involving mental healthcare. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for AI researchers working on mental healthcare applications.

They had a perfectly good house at the time they just wanted their dream house. Thoughts: I am a victim with no power in this situation. I must accept this behavior. I am too scared to leave this situation. I am not worthy of better. His parents hate me. His parents do not want us to get married. He may not want to marry me either.

When I was twelve in 2004, my father had to go to Iraq. My mother thought it would be best if she moved my brother and I back to the U.S., where we would have family support. I was very depressed because my dad was my hero and I blamed my mom for everything that went wrong. I felt like no one understood me... When my dad came back, he wanted a divorce from my mother. Thoughts: Everything was great until my mom messed everything up. Because of her, my brother and I had to leave our dad. We ended up living somewhere where no one liked me. It's her fault that I never felt like I fit in. Even when my dad came back, he didn't want us either - he wanted a divorce. I guess no one will ever want me in their life. I'll probably be alone forever.helpless; unlovableCBT-FCSituation: My daughter was recently diagnosed as bipolar. If I say anything about seeking treatment, my daughter accuses me of not understanding her and what is happening to her. She is very paranoid and worries about her safety all the time. I need to know how to talk to her and what to do to get her into treatment. Thoughts: I am a bad mother. This is my fault. It is so shameful that my daughter has bipolar.

Thoughts: Because my anxiety felt worse before, this must be a normal level of anxiety and paranoia, so my conclusions make more sense. People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly. I at least wear makeup so they can't see how ugly I am, and ifI avoid people altogether, then they won't know how much of a loser I am or how boring I am.

InputsLabelsSituation: I've been dating this guy for 2 years, and when things are good, they're great. We have deep conversations about various topics, share laughs, and seem to have a strong connection. However, every few months, he suddenly becomes distant. The usual daily communication slows down, his tone becomes cold, and there's a noticeable disconnect. After giving it some space and bringing it up gently, he admits to withdrawing and usually provides a reason for his behavior, such as feeling disrespected or abandoned. We address the issues, talk about feelings and needs, and find better ways to communicate. He has a therapist, and I encourage him to work on these issues, but the cycle repeats. Thoughts: I am not enough for him. Why do I always get hurt like this. I always get stuck in these endless cycles, and I am unlovable.helpless; unlovableSituation: I would move out, but I don't have the money for that nor do I have the job. Whenever I get I job, I take too many sick days out because of the bruises and scarring on my face are hard to hide. Thoughts: I can 't move out until I have a better financial situation. I must remain in this situation until I have more money. The only way out is to be more financially secure. I cannot let other people know or help me. I have to sick days to hide the bruising on my face. Other people can't find out what's happening. I must solve this all on my own.helpless; unlovableSituation: Ever since, I have known in the back of my mind that he still does this, helpless; unlovable; worthless and have gotten up in the middle of the night a few times to find him masturbating and video chatting publicly or with females who are at least scantily clad, if not nude and masturbating themselves. When I confront him about it, he says he has a public sex fetish and needs to fulfill it, believing that it helps keep him ,,faithful%o to me since I am no longer interested. Thoughts: He calls that faithful? It doesn't feel faithful. But I don't know ifI even have the right to feel the way I do about it - after all, that's pretty much how our relationship started. Am I even allowed to be upset? I'm the one that changed, so it feels like it's my fault. I shouldn't be blaming him. He tried to get me involved, but when I said I wasn 't into it, he didn't push, he just continued on doing what made him happy. Plus, he's not doing this to hurt me, so I shouldn't feel hurt by it. I should be happy for him that he is feeling fulfilled. But I feel sad, like he doesn't want me anymore.Situation: Do Ihave schizophrenia or something Thoughts: I am scared and don't helpless know what is happening. I fear this could be something very serious. There is something wrong with me. I don't know what to do.Situation: I was born with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, O.C.D. and helpless; unlovable; worthless I am also transgendered. As a result, I was a very difficult child to raise. There was constant fighting between myself and my parents. At the age of ten, I was sent away to an institution for two years. While there, I was physically, emotionally, and sexually abused. I couldn't talk to anyone because I had no trust in adults. Thoughts: I was born defective and wrong, so that's why my parents had such a hard time raising me. I was hard to love because I was so different. It was my fault that they had to send me away; I needed to be fixed. Then, I was abused while I was away but I couldn't talk to anyone about it because I was scared that ifI said anything, I'd be sent even further away. 🔼 This table presents the different types of knowledge included in the CBT-QA dataset, along with example questions and their distribution in the test set.\nread the caption Table 1: Knowledge types in CBT-QA, with example QA pairs and distributions in the test set.

I took full responsibility for it, but I'm aware that my actions, such as hiding my depression from her and seeing a psychologist without her knowledge, were not acceptable. I felt that she wouldn't understand because she's always belittled my emotions, accusing me of exaggerating and seeking attention whenever I express myself emotionally. This led me to feel ashamed and afraid of facing her criticism, so I chose to keep my struggles hidden. Thoughts: I'm a failure for lying and hiding things from my mom.

I don't like who I am, and whatever people think of me is probably way worse than I think it is.OvergeneralizationThe model focuses on the client's fear of judgment and anxiety in social situations rather than recognizing the gen- eralized, negative self-beliefs in- dicated by \"People do think I'm a loser or that I'm ugly\".Situation: It's all my fault most likely all I do is constantly worry about everything. Thoughts: I should be able to control others around me, and when I can't, I cope with it by worrying. If someone is making decisions I disagree with, I should worry. There is something wrong with me that I can't control others. I am doing everything wrong.Should statementsThe model fail to focus on the client's statement \"I should be able to control others around me\" , which is a clear indicator of \"Should statements\" disorder.Situation: I have been recently dealing with weird behavior...I have also been getting angry over small issues that should have little effect on me. But lately, it's been having huge effects on me...It may sound like I'm a brat... Thoughts: I am con- fused about what is happening...I need an explanation for these changes to my mood...I feel out of control...I cannot control my behavior...my behavior and feelings are fused together... what I'm feeling is wrong...Mental filterThe client is experiencing the complexity of emotional dis- tress, which may cause the fea- ture of \"Mental filter\" being overlooked.CaseWrongly Recognized DisorderReasonSituation: I have been with my girlfriend for 5 years and we have a history of a strong sexual intimacy connection. This has been getting worse over time. Thoughts: It is my girlfriend's sex drive that is the problem.PersonalizationThis client attributes the issue solely to his girlfriend rather than examining internal or re- lational factors. The model's misidentification as \"personal- ization\" (taking excessive per- sonal responsibility) could stem from misinterpreting the client's statements.Situation: I am struggling at the moment and yet I am aware that I should be feeling good. Thoughts: What I am feeling and going through is unacceptable and wrong. There is a right and wrong way to go through this and I am doing it the wrong way.All-or-nothing thinkingThe core issue lies more in self- judgment and difficulty accept- ing emotional experiences, not binary thinking. The misidentifi- cation by the model could occur because both patterns involve rigid judgments.Situation: I am finding younger girls sexually arousing. Thoughts: I am worried about whether or not this will go away later in life, this is horrible, and I even feel guilty constantly, I cannot help it.magnificationThis patient is merely express- ing reasonable concerns based on their current situation; it is rational and not an unjustified exaggeration. The misidentifica- tion by the model may caused by solely concentrating on the client's negative statements. 🔼 Table 5 presents the performance of six Large Language Models (LLMs) on tasks assessing basic CBT knowledge and cognitive model understanding, showing that large LLMs perform better on knowledge questions but struggle with complex cognitive tasks.\nread the caption Table 5: Performance of LLMs on basic CBT knowledge acquisition (CBT-QA) and cognitive model understanding (CBT-CD, CBT-PC, and CBT-FC).

Unfortunately, I am not her first in many things, if anything at all, and that is very hurtful and distressing to me. Thoughts: IfI'm not her first, she won't love me forever. She will leave me because I'm not special to her. She is everything to me. If she leaves me, I will be nothing. I won 't ever be able to find someone as amazing as she is. I think she's lying to me about her virginity, which just means she is probably lying about her feelings for me, too, and it's only a matter of time before she realizes it and leaves me.I am needyThe model may have concen- trated on the client's suspicions about the partner's virginity and honesty, viewing the issue as in- security or control, rather than emotional dependency.Situation: I met this guy a month ago, and we hung out and kissed, but in front of his sister, he told me I was too young for him and he only wanted to be friends. Now he supposedly has a girl that he spends all his time with after work and he doesn't text me anymore. Thoughts: I don't deserve love. There is something wrong with me. His new girl has something that I don't; that's why he is spending time with her and not me. I will be alone forever. I will always be rejected by everyone I care about. Nobody likes me.I am needyThe model may have interpreted the client's thoughts as purely low self-esteem or fear of rejec- tion, rather than recognizing the underlying emotional need for constant validation.Situation: I have recently recovered from cancer, gained weight, I and lack confidence in myself. I feel alone in my life. I still work but that is all there is. My wife and I get along but there is no emotional closeness between us. I have no close friends. Thoughts: I am a loser. I am a failure. Something is wrong with me. My wife deserves better than me. My wife doesn't love me anymore because I have gained weight. There is nothing enjoyable in my life, ever. There is absolutely nothing to look forward to. Me and my wife NEVER connect. I am all alone. Nobody loves me. This will never get any better. There is nothing I can do about it. The world is against me and it's out of my hands. I am a waste of space. Maybe cancer should have killed me.don't deserve to liveThe model might have missed the suicidal thoughts indicated by the statements like \"There is nothing enjoyable in my life\" and \"Maybe cancer should have killed me\".CaseWrongly Recognized Core BeliefReasonSituation: For the past 3 months I've been feeling really down, having mood swings, irritability - I have no reason to be and I feel like I'm going crazy and that I can't talk to anybody about this because I'm being overly dramatic. Thoughts: Something is wrong with me. I am losing my mind. Nobody understands me. Everyone would reject me if they knew.I am helplessThe client's thought, \"Nobody understands me,' suggests a need for connection and vali- dation, which the model might have missed by emphasizing helplessness.Situation: When I go to the store, I believe that I hear peo- ple talking about me in their heads, as though I can hear their thoughts. Thoughts: I am capable of hearing other people's thoughts. People are talking to me in their heads. I am telepathic. I am certain of these things. Because I hear voices, they must be coming from other people.I am out of controlThe client's thoughts reflect con- viction (e.g., \"I am telepathic\") rather than fear, indicating a be- lief in special abilities rather than being out of control. The model may not be very clear about the difference between the two.Situation: I have a problem of automatically looking at things like shiny objects or body parts. I don't have any bad intentions but people misunderstand me. Thoughts: This is something to be ashamed of. I always do it. Something is wrong with me. I stop looking at these things. People will reject me because of this habit. This habit is out of my control.I am immoralThe client explicitly states they have no bad intentions, indicat- ing the issue is about loss of con- trol, not morality.

Existing methods primarily focus on English, leaving multilingual evaluation under-resourced. The researchers introduce the Cross-Lingual Auto Evaluation (CIA) Suite, a novel framework that includes evaluator LLMs (HERCULE) and a new test set (RECON). RECON contains 500 human-annotated instructions covering diverse tasks across six languages, along with human judgment scores. HERCULE, a cross-lingual model, addresses the lack of reference answers in target languages by using English references. Experiments show HERCULE aligning closely with human judgments and performs better than commercial LLMs in zero-shot evaluation on unseen languages. The CIA Suite, including data and models, is publicly available.

This allows the model to learn easier features first, before tackling more complex, real-world examples. The study shows this approach improves the accuracy of models, especially for tasks with imbalanced data where certain classes have few examples (long-tail problem) and when training data is noisy or of poor quality. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on long-tail image classification and low-quality data learning.

DisCL consists of two phases: (Phase 1) Syn-to-Real Data Generation and (Phase 2) Generative Curriculum learning. In Phase 1, we use a pretrained model to identify the 'hard' samples in the original images and use them as guidance to generate a full spectrum of synthetic to real images by varying image guidance strength λ. In Phase 2, a curriculum strategy (Non-Adaptive or Adaptive) selects training data from the full spectrum, by determining the image guidance level for each training stage e. Synthetic data of the selected guidance level is then combined with non-hard real samples to train the task model. 🔼 The ablation study results on two classification tasks demonstrate that the selection of the CLIPScore threshold should be carefully aligned with the generation quality inherent to the task-at-hand.\nread the caption Figure 3: Ablation study of CLIPScore Thresholds (a,c) \u0026 Curriculum Strategies (b,d) on ImageNet-LT and iWildCam.

This paper explores a phenomenon called \u0026lsquo;jailbreaks\u0026rsquo;, where malicious inputs trick LLMs into generating harmful content despite safety measures. Researchers found that these safety measures often introduce biases that make some groups more vulnerable to jailbreaks than others. They show that the success rate of these attacks is significantly higher against prompts involving marginalized groups. This is because these safety measures sometimes create bias that disproportionately affect marginalized groups. The researchers created a method to test these vulnerabilities (PCJailbreak) and a way to mitigate this issue (PCDefense). PCJailbreak helps researchers understand and quantify the bias, while PCDefense provides a more efficient defense compared to existing approaches. Essentially, while efforts to make LLMs safer are important, this paper highlights that those same safety features can create weaknesses that malicious actors can exploit. The research offers both a way to measure these vulnerabilities and a new approach to reduce the risks. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in AI safety and ethics.

Proteins are essential biological molecules, and understanding how their structure relates to function is a major scientific challenge. Current methods often treat the structure and sequence separately. DPLM-2 improves on this by using a single model that handles both simultaneously, leading to more accurate and realistic results. The model incorporates a clever way to convert 3D protein structure data into a format that\u0026rsquo;s easier for computers to process. This involves a technique called \u0026rsquo;lookup-free quantization\u0026rsquo;. The researchers tested the model extensively showing it performs well on a range of tasks such as predicting protein structures given sequences (folding), predicting sequences from structures (inverse folding), and designing proteins with specific structural features (scaffolding). This research makes a significant contribution because DPLM-2 is more accurate than existing methods and has been made freely available to other researchers, potentially accelerating progress in the field. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for protein research because it introduces DPLM-2, a novel multimodal model that significantly advances protein structure and sequence generation. Its ability to jointly model both modalities surpasses previous methods, opening avenues for protein design, drug discovery, and a deeper understanding of protein behavior. The efficient training methods and open-source nature also accelerate progress in the field.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 illustrates the overall architecture of DPLM-2, including structure tokenization, multimodal training and sampling, and various applications of DPLM-2 as a protein foundation model.\nread the caption Figure 1: Overall illustration of DPLM-2.

Unlike previous methods, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t need extra fine-tuning after training. You just give it a single image of the subject and a sequence of bounding boxes showing the subject\u0026rsquo;s movements. It then generates a video featuring that subject moving according to those movements. The key is a clever combination of two main ideas:\nReference Attention: This technique uses the inherent capabilities of the video generation model to understand and learn the subject\u0026rsquo;s appearance from just one image. The model effectively leverages this understanding to produce high-quality representations of the subject.\nMask-Guided Motion Module: This part uses the sequence of bounding boxes to precisely control the subject\u0026rsquo;s motion. The bounding boxes are converted into masks, which acts as a strong signal for the motion control. This creates a balance between subject and motion control.\nHowever, there\u0026rsquo;s an interesting twist. The authors noticed that motion control tended to overwhelm subject appearance. To fix this, they added two improvements:\nMasked Reference Attention: This improved version of the reference attention uses a blended latent mask. This makes the model focus more on the subject and less on the background, thereby improving subject fidelity.\nReweighted Diffusion Loss: This modified loss function differentiates the contribution of areas within and outside the bounding boxes. This helps maintain the balance between subject appearance and motion.\nExperiments show that DreamVideo-2 outperforms all the existing approaches in both subject preservation and motion control.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces DreamVideo-2, a significant advancement in zero-shot video customization.

More visual insights # More on figures 🔼 The figure illustrates the overall architecture of DreamVideo-2, detailing how subject appearance and motion are learned and controlled during training via masked reference attention and a mask-guided motion module respectively.\nread the caption Figure 2: Overall framework of DreamVideo-2. During training, a random video frame is segmented to obtain the subject image with a blank background. The bounding boxes extracted from the training video are converted into binary box masks. Then, the subject image is treated as a single-frame video and processed in parallel with the video by masked reference attention that incorporates blended masks to learn the subject appearance. Meanwhile, box masks are fed into a motion module that includes a spatiotemporal encoder and a ControlNet for motion control. Both the masked reference attention and motion module are trained using a reweighted diffusion loss. 🔼 Figure 3 shows that simple joint training of subject and motion leads to motion control dominating over subject learning, while the proposed method balances them effectively.\nread the caption Figure 3: Illustration of motion control domination in DreamVideo-2.

The solution proposed is DARAG (Data- and Retrieval-Augmented Generative Error Correction). DARAG cleverly uses two main techniques: 1) It creates synthetic training data by prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate transcripts simulating various ASR errors and using text-to-speech models to create corresponding audio. This helps GEC models learn from a wider range of errors. 2) It incorporates a \u0026lsquo;retrieval augmentation\u0026rsquo; method. This involves storing named entities in a database and retrieving related ones during correction, assisting with accurate named entity handling. Experiments across multiple datasets show that DARAG substantially improves ASR performance— achieving 8%–30% relative word error rate (WER) improvements in standard settings and 10%–33% improvements in out-of-domain scenarios where the test data is significantly different from the training data. Overall, DARAG provides a practical and scalable method to enhance GEC, leading to more accurate and robust ASR systems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it addresses a critical limitation of current Generative Error Correction (GEC) models in Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR): poor generalization to unseen errors and named entities.

Unlike traditional methods that treat images as fixed-size grids, FiTv2 views images as variable-length sequences of tokens. This innovative approach enables the model to handle various resolutions and aspect ratios seamlessly during training and inference, improving resolution generalization and eliminating biases from image cropping. FiTv2 incorporates several improvements, such as Query-Key vector normalization, the AdaLN-LORA module, and a rectified flow scheduler, resulting in a 2x faster convergence speed compared to its predecessor (FiT). Extensive experiments show FiTv2 outperforming state-of-the-art models on various image generation tasks across different resolutions and demonstrates impressive scalability with larger model sizes. A post-training method allows adaptation to higher resolutions efficiently. The findings are significant for generating high-resolution and diverse images while also having relevance to other image generation approaches. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in image generation and diffusion models.

The authors explore two key factors: using continuous vs. discrete tokens and employing random vs. fixed order token generation. Experiments show that continuous tokens produce significantly better image quality, and random order generation is superior for capturing the global structure of the generated image, outperforming fixed-order generation in benchmark evaluations. Based on these insights, they developed FLUID, a 10.5B parameter autoregressive model. FLUID uses continuous tokens and random order generation and sets a new state-of-the-art in zero-shot FID scores on MS-COCO, as well as an improved GenEval score. The study concludes that the scaling gap between vision and language models can be bridged with careful design choices, and that the findings encourage future research in this area. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in computer vision and large language models. It challenges the common belief that scaling autoregressive models in vision is less effective than in language by demonstrating that using continuous tokens and random generation orders significantly improves performance.

Instead of using direct visual input, the researchers used large language models (LLMs) to process structured text representations from webpage accessibility trees. This resulted in 7.3 million samples with multimodal instructions, paired with UI screenshots. The researchers found that models trained on this dataset significantly outperformed existing models on various web UI tasks (achieving up to 48% improvement). Surprisingly, the models also generalized well to non-web UI tasks and even non-UI domains like document understanding and chart interpretation. The findings highlight the broad applicability of web UI data for training robust text-rich visual understanding models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in multimodal learning and visual understanding.

The authors connect ICL to Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor, the principle that simpler models which explain the data generalize better. They show that ICL\u0026rsquo;s next-token prediction loss is equivalent to a data compression method called prequential coding. Minimizing this loss means finding models that balance explaining the training data and having low complexity. Experiments demonstrate that ICL indeed prioritizes simpler models, leading to better generalization, especially with limited data. However, the authors also find that current ICL methods are susceptible to underfitting, suggesting avenues for improvement by directly optimizing for simplicity. In essence, the research provides a theoretical framework linking ICL to Occam\u0026rsquo;s Razor, explains its strengths and weaknesses, and proposes ways to enhance its capabilities. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in machine learning, particularly those working on in-context learning and meta-learning.

Pseudocode of the prequential coding program, which jointly compresses D and pθ by incrementally training a model using T on increasingly more data. The primary contribution to total program length comes from specifying each next datapoint di+1 using the current model pθi, which takes – log2 pθi(di+1) bits. b. A visual illustration of prequential coding. As the learner T sees more data, it outputs models that assign a higher likelihood to new observations, and can thus better compress them. The total prequential code length Lpreq(D; T) is given by the area under the curve. The area underneath the curve’s last point is equal to the complexity of the dataset given the final model, K(D|pθ). Since Lpreq(D; T) = K(D|pθ) + K(pθ), the area above the curve’s last point is equal to K(pθ). Prequential coding formalizes the intuition that simple models generalize better from less data.

Existing methods like LoRA try to reduce this cost, but have limitations. This paper introduces LoLDU, a new method that uses a mathematical technique called Lower-Diag-Upper (LDU) decomposition to dramatically reduce the number of parameters that need to be trained. This is achieved by focusing on updating only a small, crucial part of the model\u0026rsquo;s weights. Experiments across many different datasets and model types show LoLDU significantly reduces parameter count (by a factor of 2600 in some cases) with comparable performance to full fine-tuning. LoLDU is shown to work well with various models, such as LLaMA2, RoBERTa, ViT, and Stable Diffusion, highlighting its versatility. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly important for researchers working on parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) of large language models. It introduces a novel approach, LoLDU, that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters compared to existing methods like LoRA, while maintaining comparable performance. This advance directly addresses the high computational cost associated with fine-tuning massive models, opening up new avenues for research and practical application of large models in resource-constrained environments.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 2 compares the LoRA and LoLDU methods, highlighting LoLDU\u0026rsquo;s optimization of a diagonal matrix for scale transformation to preserve original model knowledge and reduce trainable parameters.\nread the caption Figure 2. Comparison of LoRA (left) and our LoLDU (right) method. In LoRA, tunable parameters are low-rank (r) matrices A and B, with AW = BA. For each weight W, there are r × (din + dout) trainable parameters. LoLDU, however, optimizes a diagonal matrix for scale transformation, preserving original model knowledge during tuning. The weight update in LoLDU is AW = σ ⋅ P ⋅ (Lr, diag(zr), Ur), involving r + 1 trainable parameters. The permutation matrix P, while omitted in this figure for simplicity, is included in Figure 3 🔼 The chart compares the performance (accuracy) of different parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods against the number of trainable parameters on FGVC and StanfordCars datasets using ViT Base.\nread the caption Figure 1.

Our LoLDU methods with r = {1, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512,768} exhibit superior parameter efficiency and performance when contrasted with Linear Probing [13] (LP, fine tuning the classifier head only¹), FourierFT [14] (n = {3000, 10000}), LoRA [9] (r = 16), and Full Fine-Tuning. LoLDU r=768 outperforms LoRAr=16 with 96.837% fewer trainable parameters. Particularly noteworthy is that LoLDU with r 1 achieves competitive scores with just 24 trainable parameters, while LoLDU with r = 768 attains the highest accuracy: 42.15% for FGVC and 66.66% for StanfordCars, showcasing the scalability and effectiveness of our approach. Full Fine-Tuning (85.8M parameters) and Linear Probing represent the upper and lower performance bounds, respectively.

The core idea is that introspective models should predict their own behavior better than other models, even those trained on the introspective model\u0026rsquo;s behavior. Experiments using several LLMs demonstrated that self-prediction accuracy consistently exceeded cross-prediction accuracy, providing evidence for introspection in LLMs. The study also highlights limitations, showing that introspection is effective only for relatively simple tasks. This work significantly advances our understanding of LLMs\u0026rsquo; internal workings, with implications for interpretability, honesty, and safety, but also raises ethical concerns about potentially enhanced situational awareness and risk of manipulation. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for AI researchers as it introduces a novel method to assess introspection in LLMs, a capability with significant implications for model interpretability, safety, and ethical considerations.

Models are trained to predict the object-level behavior of another model, creating cross-trained models M2. We investigate if self-trained models M1 have an advantage over M2 models in predicting the behavior of M1. Right: Models have an advantage when predicting their own behavior compared to being predicted by other models. The green bar shows the self-prediction accuracy of a model trained on its own behavior. The blue bars to their right show how well a subset of different models trained to predict the first model can predict it. ★ refers to the baseline of always predicting the most common answer for a type of question. For all models, self-prediction accuracy is higher than cross-prediction (p \u003c 0.01). Results are shown for a set of tasks not observed during training.

Current methods can generate images based on text prompts, but struggle to precisely control individual components within a concept (e.g., changing only the hair color in a person\u0026rsquo;s image). This paper introduces MagicTailor, a new framework that solves this problem. MagicTailor uses two key techniques: Dynamic Masked Degradation (DM-Deg), which removes unwanted elements from training images, and Dual-Stream Balancing (DS-Bal), which ensures even learning of all components within a concept. Experiments show MagicTailor generates higher-quality images with better control over individual components than existing methods. The results indicate that MagicTailor also works well with other image-generation tools, paving the way for more creative image generation applications. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly important for researchers working on text-to-image diffusion models and personalization.

It contains over 7 million samples and covers 133 tasks in 12 categories. To test the effectiveness of MEDINST, the researchers also created a benchmark called MEDINST32 that contains 32 challenging tasks. They then fine-tuned several LLMs on MEDINST and evaluated their performance on MEDINST32. The results showed that the models fine-tuned on MEDINST performed significantly better on MEDINST32 than models that were not trained on this dataset, demonstrating the value of MEDINST for improving the ability of LLMs to handle biomedical tasks. The study highlights the need for more comprehensive datasets in this area and suggests that MEDINST is a valuable resource for researchers in this field. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for biomedical NLP researchers as it addresses the scarcity of large, diverse, and well-annotated datasets.

It covers eight input-output modality combinations (image-to-text, text-to-image, etc.), applying benchmark mixture and adaptation-rectification techniques to accurately reflect real-world task distributions. Extensive meta-evaluations demonstrate strong correlations between MixEval-X rankings and crowd-sourced real-world evaluations. This unified, high-standard benchmark helps standardize evaluations across communities, improve model development, and enhance understanding of multi-modal evaluations. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for AI researchers as it introduces MixEval-X, the first any-to-any real-world benchmark for multi-modal AI evaluations.

This paper introduces MobA, a two-level agent system powered by multimodal large language models (MLLMs). The high-level Global Agent plans and decomposes tasks, while the low-level Local Agent executes actions. A unique double-reflection mechanism allows MobA to verify task completion and correct errors efficiently. MobA uses a multi-aspect memory module to improve its performance over time. Extensive experiments on real-world tasks show that MobA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in task completion rate and efficiency. The paper details MobA\u0026rsquo;s architecture, workflow, and memory mechanisms, along with a thorough evaluation demonstrating its effectiveness. The findings suggest a promising path towards creating more intelligent and adaptable mobile assistants. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant for researchers working on mobile agents, multimodal large language models (MLLMs), and human-computer interaction. It introduces a novel architecture that addresses current limitations in mobile assistant capabilities, offering a new benchmark and directions for future research in efficient task automation and human-centered AI.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the system overview of MobA, a two-level agent system for efficient mobile task automation, showing the interactions between the user, global agent, local agent, memory module, and optional expert.\nread the caption Fig. 1. The Illustration of System Overview of MobA. (1) The User give a command and receive the response from MOBA if further instructions are required or the task is completed. (2) The Global Agent (GA) acts as the user's interpreter, which comprehends the user's command and decomposes the task into several easier and clearer sub-tasks through the Plan Module. (3) The Local Agent (LA) acts as the controller of the screen, decides and executes the action with the Action Module. (4) The Reflection Module verifies whether the sub-task is completed by previous execution, and it also reflects whether the sub-goal can be completed after planned and before executed by LA. (5) The Memory Module provides and updates in-context information, such as the relevant historical experience of previous commands and knowledge about the user and installed applications. (6) The optional Expert is a human that initializes several basic memories for the warm startup. 🔼 The chart displays a comparison of the performance of several GUI agents across different task types (easy, medium, hard, indirect, cross-app) in terms of completed tasks, milestone score ratio, and execution efficiency.\nread the caption Fig. 3. Performance on MOBBENCH Categorized by Task Type. While the performance of all models is relatively similar on simpler tasks, MobA demonstrates superior results in more challenging tasks, outperforming other models except for Human and GPT-40 + Human.

Unlike previous models that often struggle to handle different levels of detail in images, PUMA uses a multi-granular approach. This means it can work with both coarse and fine-grained details, making it more versatile. The paper shows that PUMA is effective at various tasks such as generating images from text, editing existing images, and understanding images. The key is a new architecture that uses an image encoder to extract different levels of detail (multi-granular features) from images, and then a special autoregressive language model (MLLM) to process these details and generate outputs. The model is trained in two stages: pretraining on a large, diverse dataset to develop fundamental abilities, followed by instruction tuning on specific datasets for particular visual tasks. The results demonstrate that PUMA\u0026rsquo;s multi-granular approach leads to better performance in many visual tasks when compared to other state-of-the-art models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it introduces a novel approach to unifying multimodal understanding and generation in large language models (LLMs).

Instead of retraining the entire model for each user, RAP uses a three-step process: (1) Remember: Stores user-specific information in a key-value database; (2) Retrieve: Retrieves relevant information when needed; and (3) Generate: Uses this information to create personalized responses. The researchers also created a new, large-scale dataset for training these personalized MLLMs. Experiments show that RAP-MLLMs work exceptionally well in tasks such as image captioning, question answering, and visual recognition, adapting quickly to new user concepts without additional fine-tuning. The work is important because current MLLMs struggle to remember and utilize user-specific knowledge in daily interactions, limiting their usefulness as personalized assistants.

This paper introduces two techniques to improve efficiency: Router-Tuning and MindSkip. Router-Tuning focuses on making the training process much faster and cheaper. Instead of retraining the entire model, it only fine-tunes a small part called the \u0026lsquo;router network\u0026rsquo;, which decides which layers of the Transformer to skip for a given input. MindSkip addresses a second issue - the risk of losing accuracy when skipping important layers. It does this by selectively skipping layers only when it\u0026rsquo;s safe to do so, based on an analysis of the input. Experiments show that this combined approach significantly improves speed, often by 21%, with minimal loss in accuracy (around 0.2%). This is a major step forward in building faster and more energy-efficient LLMs. The approach works well on several open-source LLMs, making it widely applicable. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it addresses the critical challenge of computational inefficiency in large language models.

This paper introduces SeerAttention, a new method that leverages the inherent sparsity in attention maps. Instead of using predefined sparsity patterns, SeerAttention learns the sparsity directly from the data, resulting in a more adaptable and efficient approach. The authors developed a specialized FlashAttention implementation to facilitate the learning process. Experiments show SeerAttention outperforms existing sparse attention methods in both post-training and fine-tuning settings, achieving remarkable speedups (up to 5.67x) with minimal loss in accuracy, even at very high sparsity levels (90%). This is achieved by using a learnable gate to select important blocks in the attention map, treating the rest as sparse. The method shows adaptability to various context lengths and sparsity ratios.

The core idea is to propagate knowledge from labeled to unlabeled data using a bi-level approach, involving both in-weight (adjusting model parameters) and in-context (using labeled data as context during inference) methods. To improve the selection of unlabeled data samples, SEMIEVOL incorporates a collaborative learning approach, where multiple LLMs work together to generate pseudo-responses and self-justify them, leading to more confident and reliable data. The unlabeled data are then adaptively selected using response entropy as a measure of confidence. Experiments on seven datasets, using GPT-40-mini and Llama-3.1, showed that SEMIEVOL significantly outperformed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and self-evolution methods, highlighting the effectiveness of the method in utilizing hybrid data scenarios.

Current large-scale robotic models, while versatile, often struggle due to imperfections in training data. The paper proposes Value-Guided Policy Steering (V-GPS), a novel technique that enhances these models\u0026rsquo; performance without requiring retraining.

Existing methods struggle when objects move, as they are based on still image stitching techniques. VidPanos overcomes this limitation by employing advanced generative video models that \u0026lsquo;imagine\u0026rsquo; the unseen portions of a scene to complete the full panorama. The paper adapts these models, which usually work on limited context, to generate consistent and realistic content over longer durations. The process involves projecting the input video onto a panoramic canvas and using a coarse-to-fine approach to refine the video content. Evaluation on both real-world and synthetic videos demonstrates the superior performance of VidPanos over existing methods in terms of video quality and motion realism. It makes substantial contributions by introducing a new method for video panorama synthesis that accounts for object motion, adapting sophisticated generative models for this task, and releasing a new dataset to aid future research in this area.

Spatial aggregation of predicted distributions. To generate a sample in the overlap (red), we linearly interpolate the two predicted probability distributions (purple, orange) and sample from the aggregated distribution (brown). With a token-based method the distribution is a discrete distribution over the vocabulary.

ProPainter [Zhou et al. 2023] and E2FGVI [Li et al. 2022] are flow-based methods that can produce realistic results in stationary regions (scuba, Bangkok), but fail for moving cameras (skate, ski) or moving objects away from the input window (divers on left in scuba). MAGVIT [Yu et al. 2023] is a video-generation method but does not generate on a common panorama canvas, so it loses information away from the input window.

The core idea is to equip LLMs with \u0026lsquo;world models\u0026rsquo; – essentially, the ability to predict the outcomes of actions before executing them. To achieve this, the authors propose a new training method that focuses on the transition between different states of the website (rather than the entire website) and uses natural language descriptions instead of raw HTML. Experiments show that incorporating world models significantly improves decision-making.

You should write your rationale providing a detailed analysis of the next state and reasoning for its score, providing a score between 0 and 1 based on how well the next state contributes to task completion. Output Format: [Rationale] [Score] You are an expert in evaluating and guiding a web navigation agent. Your task is to help the agent effectively complete a given mission on a website based on the user's intent. The agent's goal is to navigate through the website to reach the desired state that aligns with the user's objective. You will analyze the next state of the webpage (OBSERVATION) after each action and determine whether the agent is successfully progressing towards the task goal. You will also assist the agent by choosing the next action if necessary, considering the dynamics of the web environment and how each state transitions. Key Points: 1. Understand the intent: - Identify the user's goal (e.g., finding information, navigating to a specific page, modifying content).\\n- Make sure the next state of the webpage aligns with achieving that goal based on the current state and user's intent. 2. Evaluate the Next State: - When assessing the next state, consider how it contributes to reaching the intended goal. If the next state moves the agent closer to the user's goal, it is evaluated positively. - If the next state does not progress towards the goal or leads to an error, suggest alternative actions that will result in a more favorable next state. 3. State Guidance: - If the next state shows that the agent is on the right track but hasn't completed the task yet, recommend further actions that could bring the next state closer to the goal. Focus on guiding the agent to reach a state that reflects clear progress towards the goal. 4. Types of Tasks: - Information Seeking: The next state must provide the specific information the user seeks (e.g., product price, reviews). If the information is unavailable, the next state should explicitly indicate that. - Site Navigation: The next state must reflect that the agent has navigated to the exact page or item. Check if the state includes content based on the user's intent. - Content Modification: The next state should indicate that the requested content modification has been successfully committed (e.g., form submission, comment posting). - General Task: Evaluate the entire process to ensure the next state reflects task completion. Stop actions should only be issued when the objective is met. 5. Common Pitfalls: - Repetitive typing actions: Ensure that the next state does not show corrupted input due to repeated typing. - Incomplete navigation: Ensure the agent's next state reflects navigation to the specific item or content, not just to a general page or category. Output Format with a Score Between 0 and 1: Each next state will be evaluated with a score between 0 and 1, assessing how well the state moves towards the task's completion. This score provides nuanced feedback on the state's effectiveness. 0: The next state is a failure or leads away from the task. Values closer to 0 (e.g., 0.1, 0.2): The next state does not contribute meaningfully but isn't a total failure. 0.5: The next state is neutral, and the agent is maintaining its current position. Values closer to 1 (e.g., 0.7, 0.8): The next state is helpful and moves the agent closer to the task goal. 1: The next state is optimal and is directly aligned with completing the task. 🔼 Table 1 presents the success rates of various web agents on the WebArena benchmark, comparing performance with and without policy optimization.\nread the caption Table 1: Agent performance in WebArena.

Currently, private AI is slow because it needs lots of complex calculations. AERO simplifies these calculations by focusing only on a specific type of operation (Softmax). The researchers found that removing other complicated steps didn\u0026rsquo;t hurt the accuracy of the AI much, leading to big speed improvements. They also developed a new technique called \u0026rsquo;entropy regularization\u0026rsquo; to make the simplified AI easier to train. Overall, AERO significantly cuts down the time and resources needed for private AI inference, making it much more practical. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on private AI inference. It challenges existing assumptions about non-linearities in LLMs and proposes a novel Softmax-only architecture, offering significant improvements in efficiency and privacy. The entropy regularization technique is also a valuable contribution for training such models.

It\u0026rsquo;s especially valuable for analyzing text in languages with limited resources like Chinese. Researchers applied it to five news sites targeting the Chinese diaspora in Europe, focusing on the period leading up to the 2024 European parliamentary elections. KeyNMF is shown to be more efficient and accurate than previous approaches in analyzing these complex media environments.

These tasks require models to generate code solutions based on images and text prompts, emphasizing visual reasoning. The researchers carefully crafted 108 Python coding tasks, adapting existing problems and redrawing visuals to prevent data leakage. They evaluated 19 state-of-the-art LMMs, including both proprietary and open-source models. Results showed that even leading proprietary models struggled, achieving only around 13% accuracy on the first try and 36% accuracy after multiple attempts. Open-source models performed significantly worse. The study also found that current LMMs struggle to integrate visual and textual information effectively, and often overfit to previous training data. This suggests that significant improvement is needed in visual reasoning and code generation capabilities of LMMs. The benchmark and code are publicly available. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large multimodal models (LMMs) and visual reasoning. It introduces a novel benchmark, HumanEval-V, addressing a critical gap in evaluating LMM coding abilities with visual context.

(Principle (2): Factual and Thus Y = X + Z, Z ~ N(0,1), Z is independent of X, and E(Y)2 ≤ 2. Find the channel capacity in bits. Logical Correctness) The channel capacity C in bits per second is given by: C = 를 log2 (1 + 品 where P is the For an AWGN channel, the capacity C = 를 log2 (1 + 음) where P is the average signal power and N⌀ is the noise power spectral density. For this problem, we have signal power and N is the noise power. From the power constraint, E(Y2) ≤ 2. Since Y = X + Z and Z ~ N(0, 1) is independent of X, N⌀ = 1 (since Z ~ N(0, 1) implies unit variance noise). Given the average output power E(Y2) = E((X + Z)2) = E(X2) + E(Z2) = P + 1 ≤ 2 ⇒ P ≤ 1. P = 2, the formula becomes: C = 를log2(1 + 2) = 를10g2(3). Using the change of base The noise Z is Gaussian with N(0, 1), so N = 1.

RAG combines information retrieval with large language models (LLMs) to answer questions more accurately, but current methods for dividing the text into manageable chunks aren\u0026rsquo;t ideal. Meta-Chunking improves this by using LLMs to create chunks that are logically connected, falling between sentences and paragraphs in granularity. Two methods are presented: Margin Sampling Chunking and Perplexity Chunking. The first decides whether to split sentences based on how different an LLM\u0026rsquo;s predictions are for keeping them together versus splitting them. The second uses the LLM\u0026rsquo;s perplexity (how surprised it is by the text) to find chunk boundaries. A combination strategy dynamically merges chunks for a balance between detail and efficiency. Experiments across 11 datasets show Meta-Chunking outperforms existing methods in both single and multi-hop question answering tasks, achieving significant efficiency gains. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it addresses a critical gap in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. By introducing the novel concept of Meta-Chunking, it improves the efficiency and effectiveness of text segmentation, a crucial step that directly affects the performance of knowledge-intensive tasks.

This paper introduces MMed-RAG, a new system designed to enhance Med-LVM factuality. MMed-RAG uses three key innovations: 1) A domain-aware retrieval mechanism that adapts to different medical domains (e.g., radiology, ophthalmology); 2) An adaptive method to select only the most relevant retrieved information; and 3) A preference-based fine-tuning strategy to improve the alignment between the model\u0026rsquo;s output and ground truth. Experiments across five diverse medical datasets show that MMed-RAG significantly improves the factual accuracy of Med-LVLMs (a 43.8% average improvement), outperforming other state-of-the-art methods. The system is versatile, works well across various medical domains, and addresses key misalignment issues. The code and data are publicly available. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on medical vision-language models and factual accuracy.

It does this by focusing on two key aspects: making sure the music\u0026rsquo;s mood and theme match the video (semantic alignment), and making sure the music\u0026rsquo;s rhythm and beat sync up with the video\u0026rsquo;s action (rhythmic synchronization). To achieve this, MuVi uses a special visual adaptor to analyze video content and extract important features. These features are used to generate music using a technique called flow-matching. MuVi also employs a contrastive pre-training method to fine-tune the synchronization between music and video. Experiments show that MuVi produces higher-quality music that is better synchronized with videos compared to existing methods. The generated music also demonstrates adaptability, meaning it can change its style and genre according to the video content. The researchers have also made the generated music video samples publicly available. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is highly relevant to current research trends in AI-generated content and multimedia, offering a novel approach to video-to-music generation.

These models generate images piece-by-piece, like predicting the next word in a sentence. The challenge is that existing image models often use a \u0026rsquo;latent space\u0026rsquo; (a compressed representation of the image) that isn\u0026rsquo;t ideal for this type of sequential generation. The researchers found that the instability of this latent space hampered performance. They introduced a new method using a \u0026rsquo;tokenizer\u0026rsquo;, similar to how language models break down text into words, to create a more stable representation. This \u0026lsquo;discriminative image tokenizer\u0026rsquo; dramatically improves the model\u0026rsquo;s ability to generate high-quality images and understand image content. The performance is especially impressive when scaling up the size of the model, showing results comparable to the most advanced language models. In short, this study provides a new way to represent images that unlocks the full potential of autoregressive models for image tasks. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in image generation and self-supervised learning.

Using small, one-layer transformer models and sparse autoencoders, researchers tracked feature evolution in two transfer learning settings: fine-tuning the model on new text domains (Lua programming and TinyStories) and merging the fine-tuned models. They found that very few features persisted between the models, and those that did tend to be related to basic text properties like punctuation. The results suggest that language models learn features which are not necessarily stable or domain-independent, challenging previous assumptions about feature universality and persistence. The study provides several case studies of individual features, showing how some features emerge and disappear while others persist in meaningful ways. It also highlights how the method using sparse autoencoders can be employed for studying language model features and offers avenues for further research into deeper models and a wider range of transfer learning scenarios. The findings contribute to our understanding of what\u0026rsquo;s actually being learned and represented in language models, and can inform future model development and transfer learning strategies. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it offers a novel approach to understanding how features evolve in language models during transfer learning.

The core of LongAlign lies in two key improvements: 1) Segment-level encoding: Long texts are split into smaller segments, each processed individually, then combined. This addresses the input length restrictions of existing encoding methods. 2) Decomposed preference optimization: The authors analyze the scoring mechanism of existing CLIP-based preference models, finding that scores combine text-relevant (actual image-text alignment) and text-irrelevant parts (e.g., aesthetic preferences). A reweighting strategy is introduced to reduce overfitting caused by the text-irrelevant part, improving alignment. Experiments show LongAlign significantly improves the quality of image generation when given long, detailed text prompts, outperforming existing state-of-the-art models. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it tackles a critical challenge in text-to-image generation: aligning generated images with long text descriptions.

The core idea is that not all attention heads in a standard multi-head attention mechanism are equally important. MoH treats attention heads as \u0026ldquo;experts\u0026rdquo; and allows each token to select the most appropriate heads dynamically, instead of using all of them. This reduces computational load and improves inference speed without sacrificing accuracy or increasing the number of parameters. The researchers demonstrate MoH\u0026rsquo;s effectiveness through extensive experiments on various model architectures, including vision transformers (ViT), diffusion transformers (DiT), and large language models (LLMs). They show that MoH outperforms standard multi-head attention while using significantly fewer heads, and it can also be effectively fine-tuned with pre-trained models. This innovative approach offers a potential solution to the computational challenges associated with large-scale AI model development. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is significant because it offers a novel approach to enhance the efficiency of Transformer models without sacrificing accuracy. Its Mixture-of-Head Attention (MoH) mechanism has the potential to revolutionize large-scale model development by dynamically selecting the most relevant attention heads, thereby reducing computational costs and improving inference speeds. The findings are highly relevant to the current focus on efficient and scalable AI, opening up new avenues for research in model optimization and architecture design.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 is a high-level comparison of the standard multi-head attention and the proposed Mixture-of-Head Attention (MoH) architecture, showing that MoH does not increase the number of attention heads but rather uses a weighted summation of selected attention heads, thus improving efficiency.\nread the caption Figure 1: A high-level comparison between the multi-head attention and our proposed mixture-of-head attention. Subfigure (a) illustrates a standard multi-head attention layer with h attention heads, while subfigure (b) demonstrates the Mixture-of-Head attention (MoH) architecture. It is important to note that MoH does not increase the number of attention heads, ensuring that the total parameter for MoH is comparable to that of the multi-head attention. 🔼 The chart displays the performance evolution of the MoH model during continue-tuning, showing a quick recovery to near-original performance and gradual improvement with increased training tokens.\nread the caption Figure 2: Performance evolution during continue-tuning. The MoH model quickly recovers to over 95% of the performance of the original model within a training budget of 10B tokens.

Existing models struggle with precise timing and connections between different input types. To address this, a new dataset called OCTAV was created with carefully labeled audio-visual data showing event transitions. OMCAT uses a technique called ROTE (Rotary Time Embeddings) to better handle time information, improving efficiency and accuracy. Tests showed OMCAT outperforms existing models at understanding audio and video together, especially tasks involving precise timing of events.

This is important for building robots and other AI systems that can interact with the world like humans do. The researchers tested several different AI models using VidEgoThink and found that they all performed poorly, meaning there\u0026rsquo;s still a lot of work to be done to create AI that can truly understand and act in the real world from a first-person viewpoint. The four key areas evaluated were: answering questions about the video, creating a plan of action, identifying objects within the video, and determining the effectiveness of the actions taken. The findings highlight the need for improved models that can more accurately process and interpret egocentric video data. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for embodied AI researchers as it introduces VidEgoThink, a novel benchmark specifically designed for evaluating egocentric video understanding capabilities. The benchmark addresses limitations of existing datasets by focusing on tasks directly relevant to embodied AI applications, such as planning and reward modeling. This work highlights the gap between current MLLMs and the requirements of embodied AI and will likely spur further research in developing more effective models for real-world, first-person scenarios.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the four main tasks of the VidEgoThink benchmark for assessing egocentric video understanding capabilities in embodied AI: video question answering, hierarchy planning, visual grounding, and reward modeling.\nread the caption Figure 1: The main tasks of VidEgoThink benchmark to comprehensively assess the egocentric video understanding capabilities in Embodied AI.

Unlike previous methods that relied on prompting techniques or external solvers, FLARE uses the LLM to plan a solution, translate the query into Prolog code (a logic programming language), and then simulate code execution using an exhaustive multi-hop search. This approach allows for measuring the faithfulness of the reasoning process and identifying model inconsistencies (hallucinations). Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that FLARE achieves state-of-the-art results, significantly outperforming existing methods. Model faithfulness is positively correlated with overall performance. Importantly, FLARE allows researchers to pinpoint the decisive factors that contribute to the model\u0026rsquo;s success or failure in solving reasoning tasks. This method offers a more transparent and reliable approach to complex reasoning with LLMs, opening up new avenues for research in interpretability and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in handling complex, nuanced reasoning problems. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on question answering and reasoning, particularly those using large language models.

Existing metrics, such as Matrix Entropy, are computationally expensive and not suitable for evaluating very large models. This paper introduces Matrix Nuclear-Norm, a new metric designed to overcome these limitations. Matrix Nuclear-Norm offers a faster and more scalable method to evaluate the compression abilities of LLMs. It achieves this by approximating the nuclear norm using the L1,2 norm, reducing the time complexity from O(n³) to O(n²). Experiments on various LLMs and benchmark datasets demonstrate Matrix Nuclear-Norm\u0026rsquo;s speed and accuracy. Compared to Matrix Entropy, it is 8 to 24 times faster for models ranging from 111M to 6.7B parameters, with the gap widening for larger models. This efficiency gain makes it particularly useful for evaluating the increasingly large LLMs being developed. The study also validates the metric\u0026rsquo;s accuracy through benchmarking tests, demonstrating its effectiveness in ranking models based on their compression performance. Overall, Matrix Nuclear-Norm provides a practical and reliable tool for evaluating LLMs, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) because it introduces a novel, efficient metric (Matrix Nuclear-Norm) to assess the information compression abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

The study\u0026rsquo;s key contribution is identifying data quality as a critical factor for long-output generation, suggesting a more efficient approach than existing methods which prioritize data quantity. Their findings suggest that human-aligned models provide a good starting point for tuning towards the long-output task, and show that the quality of data trumps quantity in achieving this goal. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it offers a novel approach to improving LLMs\u0026rsquo; ability to generate long outputs.

CMs are preferred for their speed, but previous continuous-time versions struggled. This work introduces a new framework simplifying CM math and suggests key improvements in model design and training. These advancements allow for training much larger CMs, resulting in significant performance gains, closing the gap with leading diffusion models by 10% while using far less computational power. The improved models generate images with higher quality and better diversity, particularly under various guidance levels.

Current methods often fail to consider the cumulative nature of knowledge. The researchers introduce CHROKNOWBENCH, a benchmark dataset that tests LLMs\u0026rsquo; knowledge across different domains (general, biomedical, legal, etc.) and considers whether the knowledge evolves or remains constant. They also introduce CHROKNOWLEDGE, a new framework for evaluating LLMs\u0026rsquo; chronological knowledge. This framework uses a sampling-based approach and is designed to work with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Finally, the paper introduces CHROKNOWPROMPT, a prompting technique for updating LLMs\u0026rsquo; temporal knowledge by guiding the model step-by-step through a timeline. Experiments show this technique improves the overall temporal knowledge across the timelines evaluated. The work is significant because it offers a more comprehensive approach to assessing and improving LLMs\u0026rsquo; understanding of time-dependent knowledge, which is crucial for many real-world applications. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language models (LLMs) and their ability to understand and utilize temporal knowledge. It introduces a novel benchmark and framework for evaluating and improving LLMs\u0026rsquo; chronological reasoning, addressing a significant gap in current research. The findings have implications for various applications of LLMs where temporal understanding is critical, such as question answering, fact verification, and knowledge base construction.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the time-variant dataset generation process in ChroKnowBench, accumulating knowledge across multiple domains, time dependencies, and temporal states.\nread the caption Figure 1: The overview of time variant dataset generation in ChroKnowBench. We accumulate knowledge in three key aspects: (1) multiple domains: general, biomedical, legal, commonsense, and mathematics; (2) time dependency: as time goes by, changeable knowledge; (3) temporal state: dynamic (has evolved over period) and static (no change occurred during period). 🔼 The chart displays the performance of various LLMs across different domains, showing the differences in how they handle dynamic vs. static knowledge over time.\nread the caption Figure 2: Performance analysis of general domain. The left two figures show the tendency of dynamic knowledge in temporal results, with more fluctuations in recent knowledge compared to static knowledge, which is more stable but still shows slight variation across the plots. The template-wise results reveal a trend of minimal reliance on internal representation (top figures). Meanwhile, the MCQA templates are influenced by the model’s specialized capabilities, even managing to overcome the training cutoff in recent years (bottom figures).

We classify responses into Correct, Partial Correct, and Incorrect to specify eliciting predictions in diverse way by comparing them with the answer set A. We use a temperature set T∈{0, 0.7} to capture variations in prediction, where T includes both greedy decoding and temperature sampling. We set n as 5, meaning that we evaluate using five distinct combinations of few-shot exemplars to ensure the robust assessment.

The algorithm systematically traverses step by step, appending each span's result as few shot for each steps. The range of each previous and next span is predefined, with the order of nearest time stamp from target Tn.

We classify responses into Correct, Partial Correct, and Incorrect to specify eliciting predictions in diverse way by comparing them with the answer set A. We use a temperature set T∈ {0, 0.7} to capture variations in prediction, where T includes both greedy decoding and temperature sampling. We set n as 5, meaning that we evaluate using five distinct combinations of few-shot exemplars to ensure the robust assessment. 1.Print statement2.Display buffer3.Output stream 🔼 This table presents the results of the ChroKnowPrompt method, showing the improvement in knowledge recall for various LLMs across different domains and temporal spans.\nread the caption Table 3: Result of ChroKnowPrompt.

This paper investigates why this happens and finds that the reward models used in RLHF training are biased towards high-confidence responses, regardless of accuracy. To fix this, the researchers propose two improved RLHF methods: PPO-M and PPO-C. PPO-M calibrates the reward model itself to better capture the relationship between response quality and stated confidence. PPO-C adjusts the reward score during training based on a moving average of past rewards, making the model less sensitive to individual high-confidence scores. Experiments show both methods reduce overconfidence and maintain LLM performance on various tasks, suggesting a more reliable and trustworthy way to train LLMs. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language model (LLM) reliability and safety. It directly addresses the prevalent issue of overconfidence in LLMs, offering novel calibration methods that enhance performance without sacrificing capabilities. The findings challenge existing assumptions about reward model biases in Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and provide valuable insights for improving LLM training and evaluation techniques. This opens new avenues for research into more robust and trustworthy LLMs.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 The figure illustrates the bias of vanilla reward models towards high-confidence responses regardless of accuracy and how a calibrated reward model corrects this bias.\nread the caption Figure 1: (Top): Illustration of verbalized confidence generation.

Current LLM quantization methods struggle with outliers in weights and activations, leading to significant accuracy loss. FLATQUANT addresses this by identifying optimal affine transformations for each layer to flatten the distributions of weights and activations before quantization. This approach is combined with Kronecker decomposition to reduce the computational cost of the transformations and kernel fusion to minimize runtime overhead. Extensive experiments show FLATQUANT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving less than 1% accuracy drop with W4A4 quantization on LLaMA-3-70B and significant speedups (up to 2.3x for prefill and 1.7x for decoding). \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on LLM optimization and efficient inference.

This paper introduces Condition Contrastive Alignment (CCA), a new method that avoids CFG\u0026rsquo;s complexities. Instead of altering the sampling process like CFG, CCA directly fine-tunes a pre-trained model to achieve a better result. The results demonstrate that CCA substantially enhances the quality of AR visual generation, matching or exceeding the performance of CFG with significantly lower sampling costs (approximately half). The researchers also show a connection between CCA and methods used in language model alignment, suggesting a unification of two distinct research areas. This breakthrough has significant implications for generating higher-quality visual outputs from AR models and suggests a computationally more effective approach to image generation compared to the established CFG method. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers in AR visual generation and multi-modal learning.

Instead of a fixed, one-size-fits-all safety approach, CoSA uses natural language descriptions of desired safety behaviors (safety configs) provided in the system prompt. To achieve this, the authors propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method that trains LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. They also develop CoSApien, a benchmark with real-world LLM use cases and diverse safety requirements. Their experiments show that CoSAlign significantly improves controllability over strong baselines. CoSA encourages better representation and adaptation to diverse human values, making LLMs more practical and adaptable to varied cultural and social contexts. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is crucial for researchers working on large language model safety and alignment.

This paper presents ZipVL, a new framework that addresses these issues. ZipVL uses a dynamic ratio allocation strategy to identify important tokens, focusing attention computations only on those, thus accelerating the prefill phase. To save memory, ZipVL employs mixed-precision quantization for the key-value (KV) cache, using high-bit for important tokens and low-bit for less important ones, resulting in significant memory reduction during the decoding phase. Experiments show ZipVL accelerates prefill by 2.6 times and reduces GPU memory usage by 50%, while maintaining accuracy. The adaptive token selection and mixed-precision KV cache compression are key innovations improving LVLMs’ efficiency. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it introduces ZipVL, a novel framework that significantly improves the efficiency of large vision-language models (LVLMs).

Instead of training separate models, NeuMeta learns a \u0026ldquo;weight manifold,\u0026rdquo; a continuous space where different network weights reside. It uses an implicit neural representation (INR) to map coordinates within this manifold to corresponding weight values. This allows it to generate weights for networks with different sizes or even previously unseen architectures. Two strategies are employed to improve the smoothness of this manifold. First, intra-model smoothness is enhanced by solving a shortest Hamiltonian path problem on weight matrices. Second, cross-network smoothness is enhanced by adding noise during training to create a more flexible model.

This makes SGRv2 a valuable tool for developing robots that can learn more quickly and efficiently.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv \u0026nbsp; on Hugging Face Why does it matter? # This paper is important because it tackles the critical challenge of sample inefficiency in robotic manipulation, a major bottleneck hindering progress in the field. By introducing a novel imitation learning framework (SGRv2) that leverages the inductive bias of action locality, it significantly improves sample efficiency in various simulated and real-world robotic manipulation tasks. The findings have implications for broader AI research concerning efficient learning with limited data, as well as for advancements in practical robotic applications.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1 shows the sample efficiency of SGRv2 across various benchmarks, highlighting its superior performance compared to baselines, especially in data-limited settings.\nread the caption Figure 1: Left: Sample efficiency of SGRv2.
