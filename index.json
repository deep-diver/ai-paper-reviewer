Existing benchmarks are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability to other languages. CAMEL-Bench addresses this gap by providing a diverse set of tasks across eight domains and 38 sub-domains, with over 29,000 questions carefully curated by native Arabic speakers. The benchmark\u0026rsquo;s open-source nature facilitates further research and development in Arabic LMMs.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1. The proposed CAMEL-Bench covers eight diverse and challenging domains: multimodal understanding and reasoning, OCR and documents, charts and diagrams, videos, cultural-specific content, medical images, agricultural images, and remote sensing understanding in Arabic. CAMEL-Bench covers 38 sub-domains with over 29K questions carefully curated by native Arabic speakers to rigorously evaluate essential skills desired in Arabic LMMs. 🔽 Comparison of our CAMEL-Bench with existing Arabic LMM benchmarks: Exams-V [13], CVQA [46], Henna[4], and KHATT [34].

CAMEL-Bench covers 38 sub-domains with over 29K questions carefully curated by native Arabic speakers to rigorously evaluate essential skills desired in Arabic LMMs. 🔼 Figure 3. The CAMEL-Bench Filtering and Verification Pipeline consists of two paths: Original Arabic and translated Arabic. For original Arabic (top row), a 20% random sample undergoes manual verification; if errors are below 40%, the data passes; otherwise, the entire sub-category is reviewed. For Translated Arabic (bottom row), We employ Qwen7B model [8] to assess semantic similarity between the original and translated question-answer pairs on fuzzy-basis evaluation. Pairs passing the evaluation proceed, while those that fail undergo manual review. Based on this, data may require Manual Handling for manual re-translation, Refine \u0026amp; Verify for refinement through the model, or Non-Translated Review where the data is re-sent for translation due to the absence of an Arabic version. 🔼 Figure 2.

Experiments across summarization, instruction following, and open-book question answering tasks show that DeCoRe significantly improves performance.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Overview of the DeCoRe workflow. Given the same input, the base LLM (LLMbase) and the variant with masked retrieval heads (LLMmasked) predict the next token. An uncertainty estimation is applied to the base model\u0026rsquo;s output using conditional entropy: higher conditional entropy increases the contrastive factor (a), penalising predictions that align with the LLMmasked. The final prediction is selected based on weighted contrastive decoding of the outputs from both models, leading to a more grounded response. 🔽 Table 1: Performance of different models and decoding methods on faithfulness evaluation tasks.

Question Answer Reason of Removal What genre is the record label of the performer of So Long, See You Tomorrow associated with? The performer of So Long, See You Tomorrow is Bombay Bicycle Club. The record label of Bombay Bicy- cle Club is Island Records. The genre of Island Records is jazz. So the answer is: jazz. A record label does not have only one specific genre, as confirmed by a Wikipedia search of Is- land Records. What is the genre of the record label of the band that performed on the Crush Tour? The Crush Tour is performed by the band Bon Jovi. The record label of Bon Jovi is Island Records. The genre of Island Records is jazz. So the answer is: jazz. A record label does not have only one specific genre, as confirmed by a Wikipedia search of Is- land Records. Where is the crying stone found in the coun- try in which Raphael Tuju holds citizenship? Raphael Tuju is a citizen of Kenya. The crying stone in Kenya is found along the highway towards Kisumu. So the answer is: along the highway towards Kisumu.

CIT uses code to translate visual charts into text, allowing LLMs to better reason and answer questions about charts. They created a new dataset, REACHQA, using this method, which significantly improved MLLM performance on various benchmarks. This approach is efficient and scalable, solving the challenge of creating high-quality data for visual reasoning. \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u0026nbsp; read the paper on arXiv Why does this paper matter? # This paper introduces Code-as-Intermediary Translation (CIT), a novel data synthesis method for enhancing visual reasoning in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). CIT uses code as an intermediary to translate visual chart representations into text, enabling LLMs to understand cross-modal information and generate high-quality chart-related Q\u0026amp;A pairs. The resulting dataset, REACHQA, significantly improves MLLM performance on various benchmarks, showcasing the effectiveness of CIT for cost-efficient data creation and improved multimodal reasoning.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Figure 1: Error distribution of incorrect answers by MiniCPM-V2.5-Llama3 (Yao et al., 2024) on ChartQA test set (Masry et al., 2022), as judged by GPT-40. We present an example chart from ChartQA along with two error cases: one for recognition and one for reasoning. The \u0026lsquo;Other Errors\u0026rsquo; include question misunderstood errors, knowledge and hallucination errors, or refusal to answer. 🔽 Comparison of existing chart-related datasets across three properties.

Cells marked with \u0026#39;X\u0026#39; indicate mixed attributes (e.g., partially template-based; scalable Q\u0026amp;A but non-scalable chart data.). “*” indicates that while the chart-plotting codes are public, the Q\u0026amp;A generation still relies on data tables.

The process begins with 33 seed codes and generates plot codes across various chart types, topics, and complexity levels through the Self-Instruct and Evol-Instruct stages. The chart set and instruction set are constructed bi-directionally, and the final filtered data yields REACHQA, a dataset for distilling visual chart reasoning abilities from LLMs to MLLMs. 🔼 Figure 5: An example of attention visualization from the ChartQA dataset. The top row shows the results from the vanilla LLaVA-Next-Llama3-8B model, while the bottom row displays the results from our fine-tuned model. For each output, we present the attention distribution (highlighted zones) at three key steps, calculated by averaging the attention values of all tokens in each step. 🔼 Figure 6: Visualizations of different chart-related training datasets. As shown, REACHQA and ChartGemma exhibit higher chart richness compared to several other datasets.

(b) Watermarking performance. Each method is illustrated with a diamond and four bars. The area of the diamond represents the method\u0026rsquo;s encoding capacity. The y-coordinate of the diamond\u0026rsquo;s center indicates normalized image quality, calculated by averaging the normalized PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FID between watermarked and input images. The x-coordinate represents robustness, measured by the True Positive Rate at a 0.1% False Positive Rate (TPR@0.1%FPR) averaged across four types of image editing methods, encompassing a total of seven distinct models and algorithms. The four bars are oriented to signify different editing tasks: image regeneration (left), global editing (top), local editing (right), and image-to-video generation (bottom). The length of each bar reflects the method\u0026rsquo;s normalized TPR@0.1%FPR after each type of image editing-the longer the bar, the better the performance. 🔽 Comparison of watermarking performance in terms of watermarked image quality and detection accuracy across various image editing methods. Quality metrics are averaged over 10,000 images, and the TPR@0.1%FPR for each specific editing method is averaged over 5,000 images. The best value in each column is highlighted in bold, and the second best value is underlined.

In this example, the editing model Instruct-Pix2Pix, denoted as ∈(·), is employed. The function F(·) represents the Fourier transform, and we visualize its magnitude on a logarithmic scale. 🔼 Figure 4: The overall framework of our method, VINE. We utilize the pretrained one-step text-to-image model SDXL-Turbo as the watermark encoder. A condition adaptor is incorporated to fuse the watermark with the image before passing the information to the VAE encoder. Zero-convolution layers (Zhang et al., 2023) and skip connections are added for better perceptual similarity. For decoding the watermark, we employ ConvNeXt-B (Liu et al., 2022b) as the decoder, with an additional fully connected layer to output a 100-bit watermark. Throughout the entire training process, the SDXL-Turbo text prompt is set to null prompt. Figure 9 shows the condition adaptor architecture. 🔼 Figure 1: (a) Flowchart of the W-Bench evaluation process. (b) Watermarking performance. Each method is illustrated with a diamond and four bars. The area of the diamond represents the method\u0026rsquo;s encoding capacity. The y-coordinate of the diamond\u0026rsquo;s center indicates normalized image quality, calculated by averaging the normalized PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and FID between watermarked and input images. The x-coordinate represents robustness, measured by the True Positive Rate at a 0.1% False Positive Rate (TPR@0.1%FPR) averaged across four types of image editing methods, encompassing a total of seven distinct models and algorithms. The four bars are oriented to signify different editing tasks: image regeneration (left), global editing (top), local editing (right), and image-to-video generation (bottom). The length of each bar reflects the method\u0026rsquo;s normalized TPR@0.1%FPR after each type of image editing-the longer the bar, the better the performance. 🔼 Figure 11: The reconstruction quality of stochastic regeneration and deterministic regeneration.

During inference (a), we invert a given video into a noisy latent by iteratively adding noise. We then use an inflated U-Net denoiser (b) along with the trained text embedding as input to denoise the segments. A tracking module ensures that the generated segments are spatially and temporally consistent via spatio-temporal guidance. The video latent zł is updated by a tracking energy Etrack (c) that makes the segments temporally consistent and also a low-frequency regularizer (d) Ereg which guides the model towards better spatial consistency. 🔼 Figure 4: Segment tracking module ensures that segments are consistent across time. It uses co-tracker to track each point of the object\u0026rsquo;s segment (here it is nose) and then finds point correspondence of this segment (denoted by blue dots) across timesteps. When the tracked point is of a different class (e.g,. face) then it is recovered by using temporal voting. The misclassified pixel is then replaced by the average of the neighbouring pixels of adjacent frames. This results are temporally consistent segments without visible flickers. 🔼 Figure 3: Best viewed in Adobe Acrobat. 🔼 Figure 5: SMITE-50 Dataset sample. 🔼 Figure 6: Visual comparisons with other methods demonstrate that SMITE maintains better motion consistency of segments and delivers cleaner, more accurate segmentations. Both GSAM2 and Baseline-I struggle to accurately capture the horse’s mane, and GSAM2 misses one leg (Left), whereas our method yields more precise results. Additionally, both alternative techniques create artifacts around the chin (Right), while SMITE produces a cleaner segmentation. 🔼 Figure 7: Additional results. We visualize the generalization capability of SMITE model (trained on the reference images) in various challenging poses, shape, and even in cut-shapes. 🔼 Figure 8: Segmentation results in challenging scenarios .

This paper presents a new set of foundation models, called Llama 3. It is a herd of language models that natively support multilinguality\u0026hellip; Question Llama 3 RoPE 3 STRING How many long-context training stages does Llama3 have? Please describe them (The answer is in Section 3.4.2 of Llama Team (2024) ) Llama3 is a large language model developed by Meta AI, and it has several training stages to achieve its impressive performance. The training stages are as follows: 1 Initial Pre-Training: In this stage, Llama3 is pre-trained using AdamW with a peak learning rate of 8x10-5, a linear warm-up of 8,000 steps, and a cosine learning rate schedule decaying to 8x10-7 over 1,200,000 steps. 2. Long Context Pre-Training: In this stage, Llama3 is trained on long sequences to support context windows of up to 128K tokens. The model is gradually adapted to the increased context length in increments, starting from the original 8K context window and ending in the final 128K X(cannot follow instruction) Llama3 has six stages of long-context training, starting from an 8K context window and ending in a 128K context window. This long-context pre-training stage was performed using approximately 800B training tokens. V totally the same as decribed in Section 3.4.2 Answer explanation: The question requires the reader to identify the number of long- context training stages in Llama3 and describe them Llama Describe the differences in model architecture between Llama3 and Llama2 (The Llama Team (2024) ) The paper describes Llama3 as a dense Transformer model with 405B parameters, while Llama2 is not specified to have a specific model architecture. However, based on the context, it can be inferred that Llama2 is likely a dense Transformer model as well, but with fewer parameters than Llama3. The paper highlights that Llama3 makes minimal architectural modifications to Llama2, suggesting that the main differences between the two models lie in the scale and hyperparameters rather than the architecture itself. X(not the Question Llama 3 RoPE Llama 3 STRING answer is in Section 3.2 of addressing question) The main differences between Llama-3 and Llama-2 are: 1. Llama-3 uses grouped query attention (GQA) with 8 key-value heads to improve inference speed and reduce the size of key-value caches during decoding. 2. Llama-3 uses an attention mask that prevents self- attention between different documents within the same sequence. 3. Llama-3 has a larger vocabulary with 128K tokens, which includes 100K tokens from the tiktoken tokenizer and 28K additional tokens to better support non-English languages. 4. Llama-3 increases the RoPE base frequency hyperparameter to 500,000, which enables better support for longer contexts.⌀ Question Llama 3 RoPE How does Llama3 perform context parallelism in training (The answer is in Section 3.3.2 of Llama Team (2024)) A. By using a combination of tensor parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism. B. By using a combination of pipeline parallelism and data parallelism. C. By using a combination of tensor parallelism and data parallelism. D. By using a combination of context parallelism, pipeline parallelism, and data parallelism.E. By using only data parallelism. Answer: DX(deviated from the question) in training is implemented the communication and computation in the critical path. V Llama 3 STRING The context parallelism Llama-3 using an all-gather based method, where the key (K) and value (V) tensors are first all-gathered and then the attention output is computed for the local query (Q tensor chunk. This approach is used to support different types of attention masks, such as the document mask, and to balance Question Llama 3 RoPE What are the two criteria used to assess successful adaptation in long-context training (The answer is in Section 3.4.2 of Llama Team (2024)) Model performance on short-context evaluations and needle-in-a-haystack tasks. V correct but incomplete Llama 3 STRING The two criteria used to assess successful adaptation in long-context training are: 1. Model performance on short-context evaluations has recovered completely. 2. The model perfectly solves \u0026ldquo;needle in a haystack\u0026rdquo; tasks up to that length. These criteria are mentioned in Section 3.4.2 of the paper.

Human annotations are collected from linguists and native speakers, and are used to create open-ended prompts that represent real-world use cases. X(hallucination! it describes the multilingual SFT data) Llama 3 STRING In the paper, it is stated that the SFT data is comprised of the following sources: \u0026ldquo;prompts from our human annotation collection with rejection-sampled responses\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;synthetic data targeting specific capabilities\u0026rdquo; · Additionally, it is mentioned that the SFT data is also comprised of \u0026ldquo;human-curated data\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;small amounts of human-curated data\u0026rdquo; for certain capabilities.

V Question How do the authors verify the long context code reasoning of Llama-3 (The answer is in Section 4.3.4 of Llama Team (2024)) Llama 3 RoPE They select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files, and remove one of these key files from a repository.X(not addressing the question) Llama 3 STRING The authors verify the long context code reasoning of Llama-3 by parsing Python files to identify import statements and determine their dependencies. From here, they select the most commonly depended-upon files, specifically those referenced by at least five other files. They remove one of these key files from a repository and prompt the model to identify which files depended on the missing file and to generate the necessary missing code. V Question How does the llama3 team solve the Hallucinations issues (The answer is in Section 4.3.6 of Llama Team (2024)) Llama 3 RoPE They follow the principle that post-training should align the model to \u0026ldquo;know what it knows\u0026rdquo; rather than add knowledge, and generate data that aligns model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data.X(in complete) Llama 3 STRING The authors use a knowledge probing technique to align the model generations with subsets of factual data present in the pre-training data. This data generation process involves extracting a data snippet from the pre-training data, generating a factual question about these snippets, sampling responses from the model, scoring the correctness of the generations, scoring the informativeness of the generations, and generating a refusal for responses that are consistently informative and incorrect across the generations.

Left illustrates the pipeline to generate a synthetically ranked preference dataset. It starts by collecting prompts and generating images using the same prompt for different T2I models. Next, we calculate the overall preference score using Reward models (e.g., PickScore, ImageReward). Finally, we rank these images in the decreasing order of preference scores. Right: Given true preference rankings for generated images per prompt, we first obtain predicted ranking by current model checkpoint using scores si (see Eq. 5). In this instance, although the predicted ranking is inverse of the true rankings, the ranks (1, 4) obtains a larger penalty than the ranks (2, 3). This penalty is added to our ranking loss through DCG weights (see Eq. 6). Thus, by optimizing θ with Ranking Loss (see Eq. 7), the updated model addresses the incorrect rankings (1,4). This procedure is repeated over the training process, where the rankings induced by the model aligns with the labelled preferences. 🔽 Quantitative Results on GenEval.

Right: inside the diffusion models we shift the logits to compute the loss with the next token (i.e., the loss on hi would be with respect to xi+1), while perceptually, the diffusion models are still functioning as recovering the original signals (since hi corresponds to xi+1 in AR loss). 🔽 Comprehensive evaluation of different diffusion language models and the same scale pre-trained autoregressive models.

Massive internet-sourced embodied videos with captions are used to train data generation models. Fine-grained Human Feedback Annotation is then applied to the embodied videos according to the corresponding Task Instruction Prompt List, covering multiple embodied dimensions. 🔼 Figure 3: Overview of Implicit Manipulative Evaluation. Embodied tasks in different scenarios are decomposed into executable sub-tasks. The video generation model generates corresponding predicted videos based on the current instructions and real-time observations. Using a pre-trained IDM or a goal-based policy, the agent executes the generated sequence of actions. After a fixed timestep, the predicted video is refreshed by sampling again from the video generation model, and this process repeats. Finally, the success rates of various embodied tasks are obtained through monitors in the simulation environment. 🔼 Figure 7: Rollout of Open-Ended Embodied Environment in Implicit Manipulative Evaluation. 🔼 Figure 8: Rollout of Autonomous Driving in Implicit Manipulative Evaluation. 🔼 Figure 9: Rollout of Robot Manipulation in Implicit Manipulative Evaluation.

LVSM first patchifies the posed input images into tokens. The target view to be synthesized is represented by its Plücker ray embeddings and is also tokenized. The input view and target tokens are sent to a full transformer-based model to predict the tokens that are used to regress the target view pixels. We study two LVSM transformer architectures, as a Decoder-only architecture (left) and a Encoder-Decoder architecture (right). 🔼 Figure 3: Object-level visual comparison at 512 resolution. Given 4 sparse input posed images (leftmost column), we compare our high-res object-level novel-view rendering results with two baselines: Instant3D\u0026rsquo;s Triplane-LRM (Li et al., 2023) and GS-LRM (Res-512) (Zhang et al., 2024) . Both our Encoder-Decoder and Decoder-Only models exhibit fewer floaters (first example) and fewer blurry artifacts (second example), compared to the baselines. Our Decoder-Only model effectively handles complex geometry, including small holes (third example) and thin structures (fourth example). Additionally, it preserves the details of high-frequency texture (last example). 🔼 Scene-level visual comparison. We evaluate our encoder-decoder and decoder-only models on scene-level view synthesis, comparing them against the prior leading baseline methods, namely pixelSplat (Charatan et al., 2024), MVSplat (Chen et al., 2024), and GS-LRM (Zhang et al., 2024).

The dataset and pipeline are made publicly available.\nKey Takeaways # \u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\r\u003c?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?\u003e\rVisual Insights # 🔼 Dependency graph of the LabelMakerv2 pipeline. Our LabelMakerv2 pipeline has a clear dependency structure that has to be handled in the distributed processing of the data. This has to be especially respected when recovering from job failure. There, our recovery strategy checks for unfinished jobs in the dependency graph before submitting any new jobs to avoid unnecessarily wasting compute resources. The boxes with thick yellow frame donotes visualizable tasks. These are used during inspection and job quality assurance. 🔽 Table 1.
