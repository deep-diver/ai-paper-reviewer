{"importance": "This paper introduces an **innovative method** for motion estimation, leveraging motion blur as a cue rather than a hindrance. It also contributes a **new dataset and a differentiable pipeline**, achieving state-of-the-art results and **opening new avenues** for research in motion estimation and visual odometry.", "summary": "Motion blur, usually a problem, is now a solution! This paper estimates camera motion from motion-blurred images, acting like an IMU.", "takeaways": ["Motion blur can be a useful cue for camera motion estimation.", "A new method is proposed to estimate camera motion from single motion-blurred images.", "The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on real-world benchmarks."], "tldr": "**Fast camera motions cause motion blur**, which makes existing methods to estimate camera pose fails. Conventional approaches often discard blurred frames or rely on inertial measurement units (IMUs). This introduces challenges like sensor synchronization and drift. Therefore, motion blur has always been viewed as unwanted artifact. \n\nThis paper introduces a novel approach: using motion blur as a cue for estimating camera motion. The method involves predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map from a single motion-blurred image. The instantaneous camera velocity is then recovered by solving a linear least squares problem. This creates an IMU-like measurement robust to fast movements. The model is trained on a new large-scale synthetic dataset and refined on real data using a fully differentiable pipeline.", "affiliation": "University of Oxford", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "3D Vision"}, "podcast_path": "2503.17358/podcast.wav"}
