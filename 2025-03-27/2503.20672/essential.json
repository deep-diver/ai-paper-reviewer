Existing methods fail to adhere to ultra-dense layouts in business content due to the limited scope to only limited sub-regions and sentence-level prompts. The models also struggle with article-level visual text rendering, leading to spelling errors and disorganized layouts.\n\nTo address these challenges, **BIZGEN** is introduced. The new data engine creates high-quality INFOGRAPHICS-650K and offers tens or hundreds of sub-regions from ultra-dense layouts by layer-wise retrieval and augmentation. A layout-guided cross-attention scheme injects region-wise prompts into cropped region latent space with conditional CFG and leads to more flexible inference and refinement. The system shows strong results in comparison to FLUX and SD3.", "affiliation": "Tsinghua University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.20672/podcast.wav"}
