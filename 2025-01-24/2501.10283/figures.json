(a) showcases its ability to perform photorealistic rendering, reconstruct surfaces, and track 3D objects in dynamic scenes, all while handling topological changes such as surfaces appearing, disappearing, or splitting.  (b) provides a more detailed explanation of how GSTAR manages these topological changes through two key processes: consistent tracking of existing surfaces (shown as red circles), and the generation of new surfaces for any newly appearing geometry (orange circles). This two-pronged approach ensures robust and accurate tracking even in complex dynamic environments.", "section": "Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2501.10283/x3.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Taking multi-view captures as input, GSTAR tracks and reconstructs dynamic objects frame by frame. For each frame, GSTAR first warps the previous frame\u2019s result using scene flow (Sec.\u00a03.2). It then reconstructs Gaussian Surfaces (Gaussian-attached mesh, Sec.\u00a03.1) by fixed-topology reconstruction (Sec.\u00a03.3). To handle topology-changing surfaces, GSTAR detects topology changes, unbinds Gaussians on these surfaces, and adds new Gaussians as needed (Sec.\u00a03.4). Finally, the Gaussian Surfaces are updated through re-meshing (Sec.\u00a03.5).", "description": "This figure illustrates the GSTAR method's pipeline for tracking and reconstructing dynamic objects from multi-view video data.  Starting from a previous frame's results (a), scene flow warping (Sec 3.2) initializes the current frame's geometry (b).  Next, fixed-topology reconstruction (Sec 3.3) creates Gaussian Surfaces\u2014meshes with bound Gaussians (c). The system detects topology changes, unbinds Gaussians from the affected surfaces (Sec 3.4, d), generates new Gaussians to model new geometry, and finally updates the Gaussian Surfaces via remeshing (Sec 3.5, e). This ensures both consistent tracking of existing surfaces and accurate reconstruction of new or altered ones, as demonstrated by the example of picking up a box.", "section": "3.

Panel (a) visualizes the \"unbinding weights\" calculated by Equation 10.  These weights highlight regions of the mesh where topological changes are occurring; higher weights (represented by red) indicate a greater likelihood of changes.
