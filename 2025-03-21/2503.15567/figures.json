(a) shows the three distinct modalities of a 3D molecule: atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. (b) depicts conventional methods that use separate latent spaces for each modality, resulting in fragmented representations.  This separation is often done because the 3D coordinates require SE(3) equivariance while the others do not. (c) introduces the proposed UAE-3D model, which uses a unified latent space to jointly encode all three modalities, maintaining SE(3) equivariance for the 3D coordinates.", "section": "1 Introduction"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15567/extracted/6292753/figures/framework.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Overview of the UDM-3D and UAE-3D models. The UAE-3D encodes 3D molecules from molecular space into a unified latent space, integrating multi-modal features such as atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates. This unified latent space is then utilized by the UDM-3D, which employs a DiT to perform generative modeling. Then the denoised latents are decoded back into 3D molecules.", "description": "The figure illustrates the architecture of the UDM-3D model, which consists of two main components: UAE-3D and DiT.  UAE-3D acts as a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), taking as input a 3D molecule represented by its multi-modal features (atom types, chemical bonds, and 3D coordinates).  It encodes these features into a unified latent space. This latent representation is then fed into the DiT (Diffusion Transformer), a diffusion model that performs generative modeling in the latent space. The DiT outputs denoised latent representations, which are subsequently decoded by the UAE-3D's decoder to generate a new 3D molecule.", "section": "3 Methodology"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.15567/x2.png", "caption": "(a) Training time comparison.", "description": "The bar chart compares the training time of four different models: EDM, GeoLDM, JODO, and the proposed UDM-3D model.
