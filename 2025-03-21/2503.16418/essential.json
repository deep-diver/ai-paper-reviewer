Existing methods often suffer from insufficient identity similarity, poor alignment, and low quality, especially with advanced Diffusion Transformers (DiTs). This makes it hard to flexibly manipulate images while ensuring the person's identity is maintained.\n\nInfiniteYou (InfU) tackles these issues with InfuseNet, injecting identity features into the DiT model through residual connections. This enhances identity similarity without compromising generation capabilities. A multi-stage training strategy, including pretraining and supervised fine-tuning using synthetic data, further improves text-image alignment, quality, and aesthetics. **InfU achieves state-of-the-art performance**, surpassing existing methods and offering a plug-and-play design for broad compatibility.", "affiliation": "ByteDance Intelligent Creation", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2503.16418/podcast.wav"}
