This paper inspires new research directions with code and models.", "summary": "Cosmos-Reason1: Physical AI models that reason and act in the real world, bridging the gap between perception and embodied decision-making.", "takeaways": ["Physical AI needs hierarchical ontology to capture space, time, and physics knowledge.", "Embodied reasoning benefits from a two-dimensional ontology applicable across physical forms.", "Physical AI SFT and reinforcement learning significantly improve model performance."], "tldr": "Physical AI systems, vital for real-world interaction, must perceive, understand, and act. Current large language models (LLMs) struggle to ground knowledge in the physical world. Addressing this, the research defines key capabilities for Physical AI, focusing on physical common sense and embodied reasoning.  They use ontologies for space, time, physics, and embodied understanding. This leads to models to understand and embodied decisions.\n\nThe research presents **Cosmos-Reason1** models, trained via vision pre-training, supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL). The models are evaluated using newly built benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning. Results show Physical AI SFT and RL yields significant improvements. Code and pre-trained models will be available to boost Physical AI development.", "affiliation": "NVIDIA", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Embodied AI"}, "podcast_path": "2503.15558/podcast.wav"}
