Current methods either struggle with training 3D diffusion models from scratch or encounter challenges in maintaining consistency when using 2D priors.  These limitations hinder the fidelity and generalizability of 3D content creation. \nThis paper introduces DIFFSPLAT, a novel 3D generative framework that directly generates 3D Gaussian splats using pre-trained large-scale text-to-image diffusion models.  **By utilizing web-scale 2D priors**, DIFFSPLAT maintains 3D consistency in a unified model.  A lightweight reconstruction model is used to instantly generate multi-view Gaussian splat grids for efficient dataset curation.  A 3D rendering loss is incorporated to enhance 3D coherence.  Extensive experiments showcase DIFFSPLAT's superiority in various generation tasks and its compatibility with existing image generation techniques.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2501.16764/podcast.wav"}
