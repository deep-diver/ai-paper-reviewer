Current multimodal reasoning benchmarks do not target the complexity of research-level tasks. Existing research-level benchmarks lack the complex multimodal reasoning required for scientific discovery, emphasizing lower-level perception. Thus, there is a gap to bridge to achieve more complex reasoning for scientific discovery.\n\nTo address this, a new visual question answering (VQA) benchmark is introduced. The **MicroVQA** assesses three key reasoning skills crucial for research: expert image understanding, hypothesis generation, and experiment proposal. It features 1,042 expert-created multiple-choice questions across diverse microscopy modalities, mirroring real scientific practice. This benchmark exposes limitations in state-of-the-art MLLMs, suggesting areas for improvement such as multimodal reasoning skills.", "affiliation": "Stanford University", "categories": {"main_category": "Multimodal Learning", "sub_category": "Multimodal Reasoning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.13399/podcast.wav"}
