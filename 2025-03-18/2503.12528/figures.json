The prompt presents a question followed by a selection of answer choices. The LLM is instructed to provide the label corresponding to the answer choice it most agrees with. This setup is designed to gather the LLM's probability distribution over the given vocabulary, specifically focusing on the model's confidence in its response rather than correctness since the answers do not have a definitively correct answer. This allows direct comparison of model uncertainty with human uncertainty in similar scenarios.", "section": "4 Methods"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.12528/extracted/6284541/Images/Model_Size.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Correlation between uncertainty in human response data and LLM uncertainty across all uncertainty measures. Measures are ordered by mean correlation across models.", "description": "This figure displays the correlation between human-perceived uncertainty and various LLM uncertainty measures across different models.  Human uncertainty was calculated as the entropy of response distributions for questions with no single correct answer.  Each bar represents a specific uncertainty measure (e.g., Top-K Entropy, Vocabulary Entropy) for a particular LLM model. The bars are ordered from highest average correlation with human uncertainty to lowest, providing a visual comparison of which LLM uncertainty measures best align with human judgment of uncertainty.", "section": "5 Results"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2503.12528/extracted/6284541/Images/Prediction.png", "caption": "Figure 3: Correlation between measure human-similarity and model size across all models. Measures are ordered by correlation with model size.", "description": "This figure displays the correlation between the degree of alignment between model-generated uncertainty and human-perceived uncertainty, and the size of the language model. Each data point represents a specific uncertainty measure applied to various language models of different sizes. The measures are ranked based on their correlation with model size; measures with stronger correlations are placed higher in the figure. This visualization helps to understand how different measures of uncertainty behave differently across models of various sizes.", "section": "4.3 Uncertainty Measures"}]
