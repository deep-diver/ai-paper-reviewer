Current methods mainly focus on combining temporal and spatial consistency by adding descriptions of camera movements after prompts, failing to constrain the outcomes. For videos with frequent camera movements, the interaction between different plot elements becomes increasingly complex. Thus, there is a need for more holistic approaches. \n\nThis paper introduces a dataset called **DropletVideo-10M**, featuring 10 million videos with diverse camera motions and object actions, annotated with detailed captions. The authors introduce and study **integral spatio-temporal consistency**, which considers the synergy between plot progression, camera techniques, and the impact of prior content. It also proposes an open-source model, **DropletVideo**, trained to maintain spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The project is available at https://dropletx.github.io.
