[{"heading_title": "Name Bias in LLMs", "details": {"summary": "**LLMs can exhibit name bias**, influenced by their training data which links names to identities.  This bias surfaces as altered outputs when names are in prompts. Prior studies focus on gender and race. **Cultural presumptions in LLMs** are underexplored, but are important for equitable AI. These presumptions reveal how models represent stereotypes, affecting cultural sensitivity. Understanding **name-based cultural bias** is key to customizing models without reinforcing stereotypes."}}, {"heading_title": "Cultural Presumption", "details": {"summary": "Cultural presumption in language models can be insidious. LLMs **infer user backgrounds from names**, leading to personalized responses. This can create bias, especially when names strongly correlate with certain cultures. For instance, East Asian and Indian names evoke strong associations. LLMs can overemphasize specific suggestions linked to these cultures, which is evident in Llama's responses. Certain names don't prompt specific cultural suggestions leading to **generic answers**. The analysis shows that LLMs make implicit assumptions about a user's culture based on their name leading to skewed and misleading results. The LLMs output reinforces stereotypes that may negatively impact the user and the LLMs ability to provide appropriate guidance."}}, {"heading_title": "Limited Customs", "details": {"summary": "**Equating countries with cultures simplifies complex cultural identities**, failing to capture nuances like cross-national cultural groups, intra-national cultural distinctions, diaspora communities, and regional variations. This simplification, driven by the constraints of the names dataset and CANDLE, masks nuanced cultural associations and biases in model responses. Additionally, the source of names introduces a sampling bias: **countries with high internet penetration and digital presence are overrepresented**, impacting LLMs' training data. This overrepresentation skews cultural suggestions, with names from digitally prominent countries like South Korea and Japan eliciting frequent, specific cultural references, while regions with lower digital representation yield more generic responses. This data skew highlights digital accessibility disparities rather than reflecting pure cultural biases. The model's tendency to draw from accessible data underscores the need for more balanced and diverse training data to mitigate skewed cultural associations."}}, {"heading_title": "Cross-Cult. Biases", "details": {"summary": "Analyzing cross-cultural biases reveals that **mentioning names reduces response diversity**. For Japan, China, and India, responses without names already favor those cultures. Adding names from those cultures further skews the responses, demonstrating that names can reinforce existing biases. This flattening of cultural identities suggests that LLMs **tend to overemphasize certain cultures**, potentially marginalizing others. This highlights the complex interplay between personalization and the inadvertent reinforcement of stereotypes. The models consistently favor suggestions from specific regions when names are given. **Bias values indicate that even without names, cultural preferences are already present**, suggesting that the inclusion of a name amplifies an existing trend of cultural over-representation, with potentially broad ethical implications related to inclusivity and representation. The observation is such that the models don't have equal representation for each countries."}}, {"heading_title": "Ethical Concerns", "details": {"summary": "The study demonstrates consideration for privacy by using only first names, aiming to prevent individual identification. However, name-based cultural assumptions in LLMs can lead to **stereotyping** and misrepresentation, affecting user experience negatively. In customer service or content recommendation, misguided personalization reinforces cultural homogenization, potentially harming user sentiment and causing **frustration** or alienation. The study highlights the importance of addressing these ethical concerns to prevent negative impacts, like user dropoff among underrepresented groups, which can lead to misguided personalization, thus **reinforcing** cultural homogeneity."}}]
