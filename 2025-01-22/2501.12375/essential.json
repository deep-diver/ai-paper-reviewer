This inconsistency is especially problematic for long videos.  Researchers have tried to solve this using video generation models or optical flow and camera pose data; however, these methods are inefficient or only work on short videos.\n\nThis research introduces \"Video Depth Anything,\" which uses Depth Anything V2 as a base and adds a new spatial-temporal head and a temporal consistency loss. This solves the temporal inconsistency problem while maintaining efficiency.  The key-frame-based inference strategy allows processing of very long videos.  Extensive testing demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and consistency, setting a new standard for video depth estimation.", "affiliation": "ByteDance", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Video Understanding"}, "podcast_path": "2501.12375/podcast.wav"}
