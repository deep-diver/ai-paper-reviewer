It consists of six steps, namely, standardization, source separation, speaker diarization, fine-grained segmentation by voice activity detection (VAD), automated speech recognition (ASR), and filtering.", "description": "The Emilia-Pipe pipeline processes raw in-the-wild speech data to create a high-quality dataset for training speech generation models.  It begins with standardization of the input audio to a consistent format.  Next, source separation isolates human speech from background noise and music. Speaker diarization then separates speech from multiple speakers. Fine-grained segmentation using voice activity detection (VAD) further divides the audio into shorter, manageable segments. Automated speech recognition (ASR) transcribes the speech segments into text. Finally, a filtering step removes low-quality segments based on criteria such as language, DNSMOS score (objective speech quality score), and average character duration.", "section": "III.
