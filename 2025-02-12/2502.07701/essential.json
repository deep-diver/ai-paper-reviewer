Existing methods are computationally expensive and time-consuming.  Current video generation models often compromise on quality to reduce processing time.  Also, existing diffusion models need hundreds or thousands of steps to produce a video, leading to high computational costs.\n\nThis paper introduces Magic141, which addresses these issues.  It factorizes the video generation process, making it more efficient.  It uses several optimization techniques, such as multi-modal prior condition injection and parameter sparsification, to significantly reduce computational costs and memory usage during training and inference. The result is **a model that generates a minute-long video within one minute** maintaining high quality.  This is achieved by using a two-stage process and a variety of optimizations techniques.", "affiliation": "Peking University", "categories": {"main_category": "Computer Vision", "sub_category": "Image Generation"}, "podcast_path": "2502.07701/podcast.wav"}
