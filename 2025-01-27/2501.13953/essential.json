{"importance": "This paper is crucial for researchers in the field of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) because **it addresses the growing problem of redundancy in MLLM benchmarks.**  By providing a framework for quantifying and reducing redundancy, this research helps optimize benchmark design, enhances the efficiency of model evaluation, and ultimately guides future research directions within the field. This ensures that resources are used effectively, that research efforts are focused on genuinely novel contributions, and that MLLM development progresses efficiently and meaningfully.", "summary": "This research proposes principles and a framework to tackle redundancy in MLLM benchmarks, enhancing efficiency and guiding future development.", "takeaways": ["A framework is presented to quantify redundancy in MLLM benchmarks across dimensions, instances, and benchmarks within specific domains.", "The analysis reveals significant redundancy in existing benchmarks, suggesting opportunities for optimization and resource efficiency.", "Principles for designing effective benchmarks are proposed to reduce redundancy, focusing on independence of dimensions, optimal instance count, and domain representativeness."], "tldr": "The rapid growth of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has led to a surge in the number of benchmarks, resulting in significant redundancy. This paper identifies three key types of redundancy: within benchmark dimensions, across instances within a benchmark, and across benchmarks in the same domain.  These redundancies hinder efficient model evaluation and distort research priorities.\nThis research responds by introducing a framework to quantify redundancy using correlation metrics applied to MLLM performance rankings.  The framework was tested on hundreds of MLLMs across multiple benchmarks.  The study revealed high redundancy in instances and benchmark dimensions, particularly for lower performing models. The authors propose design principles for more effective benchmarks which promote independence, optimal instance counts, and representativeness and offer strategies to refine and address redundancy effectively.", "affiliation": "Shanghai AI Lab", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2501.13953/podcast.wav"}
