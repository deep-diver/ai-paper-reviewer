This leads to inaccurate or incomplete answers, especially in scenarios requiring multi-hop reasoning where information needs to be gathered from multiple sources.  This problem is further exacerbated by the inherent difficulty in accurately training these models due to the lack of intermediate reasoning steps in available datasets. \nCoRAG solves these problems with a novel chain-of-retrieval approach. **It dynamically refines queries based on evolving context**, allowing for more accurate retrieval and multi-hop reasoning.  This approach, combined with a rejection sampling technique for data augmentation and various test-time decoding strategies, **significantly improves the model's accuracy and efficiency**.  The method is validated on multiple benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks.", "affiliation": "Microsoft Research", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Question Answering"}, "podcast_path": "2501.14342/podcast.wav"}
