For a concept Gravity, an LLM can generate its accurate description in natural language, but cannot interpret its grid-format illustration.", "description": "This figure illustrates the concept of a \"Stochastic Parrot\" using the PhysiCo task.  The task presents a concept (in this example, Gravity) in two ways:  a natural language description (low-level task) and an abstract grid-based illustration (high-level task).  The figure shows that LLMs can accurately generate a natural language description of Gravity, demonstrating a seemingly high level of understanding. However, they struggle to correctly interpret the grid-based representation, failing the high-level task, indicating that their understanding might be superficial, merely mimicking patterns (like a parrot) without true comprehension.", "section": "3.2 Our PHYSICO Task"}, {"figure_path": "https://arxiv.org/html/2502.08946/extracted/6193388/figure/gravity_examples.png", "caption": "Figure 2: Examples of input-output grids labeled as Gravity, with increasing difficulty levels.", "description": "Figure 2 presents two examples of input-output grid pairs, both labeled as representing the concept of Gravity.  The top example illustrates the inverse square law, showing how gravitational force diminishes with increasing distance between two objects.  The bottom example depicts a parabolic trajectory, connecting the concept of gravity to that of inertia. These examples highlight the increasing complexity and abstraction levels of the tasks within the PHYSICO benchmark. The grids move beyond simple recall of facts to require deeper conceptual understanding.", "section": "3.2.2 High-level Understanding Subtasks"}]
