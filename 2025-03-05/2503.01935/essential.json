Existing benchmarks either focus on single-agent tasks or are confined to narrow domains, failing to capture the dynamics of multi-agent coordination and competition. Thus, there is a need to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across diverse, interactive scenarios. Current evaluation paradigms remain insufficient for multi-agent scenarios. Traditional single-agent benchmarks primarily focus on isolated reasoning and generation, overlooking the dynamics intrinsic to multi-agent interactions. \n\nThe study introduces **MultiAgentBench**, a benchmark to evaluate LLM-based multi-agent systems across task-solving and simulation scenarios. The MARBLE framework supports communication topologies. Experiments evaluated coordination protocols such as star, chain, and graph topologies, alongside strategies such as group discussion and cognitive planning. Notably, gpt-4o-mini reached the highest task score, while graph structure performed best in research, and cognitive planning improved milestone achievement rates.", "affiliation": "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", "categories": {"main_category": "Machine Learning", "sub_category": "Reinforcement Learning"}, "podcast_path": "2503.01935/podcast.wav"}
