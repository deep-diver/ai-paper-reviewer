A common approach to mitigate this involves a KL penalty, which prevents the model from deviating too far from its pre-trained state. However, this can hinder the discovery of novel solutions. This paper focuses on the challenge of exploration in LLMs, especially when fine-tuning for complex tasks involving a distribution shift between pre-training and RL phases. The researchers examine how varying pre-training affects the exploration dynamics in a simple arithmetic task and find that pre-trained models tend to struggle with novel problem instances.\nThis research introduces a modified KL penalty that encourages exploration by prioritizing critical tokens \u2014 words or symbols that heavily influence the final outcome.  Experiments on an arithmetic task demonstrate that this modified KL penalty significantly improves RL fine-tuning efficiency.  The paper's findings suggest that focusing exploration efforts on these key decision points, rather than uniformly penalizing divergence from the pre-trained model, is a more effective way to enhance the learning process.  **The proposed approach leads to better generalization and improved performance on unseen data, offering a valuable strategy for training LLMs capable of handling complex tasks.**", "affiliation": "Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay", "categories": {"main_category": "Natural Language Processing", "sub_category": "Large Language Models"}, "podcast_path": "2502.06533/podcast.wav"}
