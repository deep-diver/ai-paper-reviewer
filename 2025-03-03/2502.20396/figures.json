We close the environment modeling gap between simulation and the real world through an automated real-to-sim tuning module, design generalizable task rewards by disentangling each manipulation task into contact states and object states, improve sample efficiency of dexterous manipulation policy training by using task-aware hand poses and divide-and-conquer distillation, and transfer vision-based policies to the real world with a mixture of sparse and dense object representations.", "description": "This figure illustrates a sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) framework for vision-based dexterous manipulation using humanoid robots.  It highlights four key techniques that bridge the sim-to-real gap: automated real-to-sim environment tuning to reduce differences between simulated and real environments; a generalized reward design that breaks down complex manipulation tasks into simpler contact and object-state goals, thus simplifying reward engineering;  sample-efficient policy learning through task-aware hand pose initialization and a divide-and-conquer distillation method; and vision-based sim-to-real transfer facilitated by using a combination of sparse and dense object representations for improved robustness and generalization.", "section": "III.

The left panel depicts a single-handed grasping task, where the robot hand successfully grasps an object. The middle panel illustrates a box-lifting task requiring the coordination of both hands to lift a box too large for a single hand. The right panel demonstrates a bimanual handover task, where an object is transferred between the robot's two hands from right to left and then left to right. Each panel shows multiple snapshots of the robot during the task execution, highlighting the robot's ability to successfully complete these complex manipulation tasks within the simulation.", "section": "IV.

The left panel compares training with complex real-world objects versus simpler geometric primitives. The right panel shows how grouping objects into different categories impacts training. Each curve represents the average success rate across 10 independent training runs, each with a different random seed, demonstrating the impact of object complexity and training data organization on learning performance.", "section": "IV.

The top row shows markers placed on the left and right side centers of the object. The middle row shows markers placed on the top and bottom side centers. The bottom row shows markers placed only on the bottom edge.  The variations in marker placement demonstrate how the reward function, which is based on these markers, shapes the robot's learned behavior and resulting contact patterns during dexterous manipulation.", "section": "E.

Our learned policies remain robust under different force perturbations, including knock (top left), pull (top right), push (bottom left), and drag (bottom right).", "description": "This figure demonstrates the robustness of the learned policies against various external disturbances.  Four scenarios are shown: a knock, a pull, a push, and a drag. Each of these actions is applied to the object being manipulated by the robot, and the figure shows that in each case, the robot's learned policy successfully completes the task despite the unexpected force. This highlights the policy's ability to generalize and adapt to real-world scenarios where perfect control is not always possible.", "section": "IV. EXPERIMENTS"}]
